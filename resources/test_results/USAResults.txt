The two visits occurred in room 272 on Feb. 29 and room 276 on Aug. 17 at the Old Executive Office Building (OEOB), according to the 2016 White House visitor logs.\n\nRicchetti has been a longtime adviser to President Biden and served as his chief of staff from 2013 to 2017.

According to White House visitor logs, Schwerin met her in Biden\'s "West Wi[ng]" office on Feb. 24, April 8, and June 9. It is unclear if Biden was present for the meetings.\n\nPerson is not only a former assistant at Rosemont Seneca Partners, but she is also the sister of Francis "Fran" Person, a longtime Biden aide who left the White House a few months after she joined Biden\'s office in May 2014. He served as an advisor to Biden between 2009 and 2014, where he traveled to 49 of the 50 countries Biden visited, including China. FOX Business previously reported on Fran\'s ties to Hunter Biden and Schwerin and how their private equity firm had a financial stake in a company run by Fran and a Chinese executive with ties to officials at some of the highest levels of the Communist Party of China.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Person siblings kept in frequent contact with Hunter and Schwerin during their Obama-Biden administration roles using their government emails, according to emails reviewed by Fox News Digital.\n\nIn addition to Person and Ricchetti, Schwerin made three other visits with staffers from Vice President Biden\'s office in 2016. Schwerin met with John McGrail, who was a counselor to Biden, on July 15 and Sept. 9 at the White House. He also met with Kaitlyn Demers, who was serving as an associate counsel in Biden\'s office in 2016, on June 28. She is currently a special assistant to President Biden and Chief of Staff Ron Klain.\n\nThe new revelations follow a New York Post report exposing Schwerin visited the White House and other official locations at least 19 times between 2009 and 2015.\n\nOne of Schwerin\'s visits - in November 2010 - was a sit-down with Biden in the West Wing as he was still president of the now-defunct Rosemont Seneca Partners.\n\nEight of Schwerin\'s other visits between 2009 and 2013 were with Joe and Jill Biden aides, the Post reported.\n\nBiden met with Hunter Biden business partner at White House in 2010: Report\n\nA White House official deflected on a media inquiry from Fox News Digital about Schwerin\'s visits to the White House during the Obama administration by criticizing "transparency" issues in the Trump administration.\n\n"These are all meetings that have been public for years because both the Obama-Biden Administration and this administration released visitor records for the sake of transparency - a practice discontinued during the Trump years," the official said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about the visits on Monday but sidestepped the question.\n\n"On Hunter Biden, the New York Post is reporting, looking at White House visitor logs, that there were 19 visits to the White House while the president was vice president by Hunter Biden\'s business partner, including one with the vice president," said a PBS reporter in the briefing.\n\n"Can you help us understand why that business partner had access and what those meetings were about?"\n\nPsaki responded by saying she didn\'t have any knowledge of the meetings.\n\n"I don\'t have any information on that," she said.

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,” McCarthy said. “And then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_mayorkasalejandro_042522gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:22'}

Seth Meyers took “A Closer Look” at why the GOP continues to embrace Trump even after more damning evidence emerges about the January 6 insurrection.\n\nLate Night with Seth Meyers has long been critical of Republicans and the conservative movement, even outside of the Trump presidency. Countless segments of “A Closer Look” have featured Meyers calling the GOP morally bankrupt and without any real policies.\n\nAny hope that things would change once Donald Trump left the White House has been dashed. Some Republicans in Congress continue to support Trump or parrot his claims about the election. Meanwhile, GOPers running for office remain desperate for Trump’s endorsement.\n\nFor Seth Meyers, this trend becomes harder to understand the more we learn about the events leading up to and immediately following the January 6 attack on the Capitol.

Meyers specifically focuses on texts from Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s daughter and adviser.\n\nMeyers compares Ivanka to a Peleton instructor in the way she called Trump’s inner circle “warriors” for their efforts to overturn the election. Even more confusing to Meyers is why Team Trump tried to plan a coup using a group chat.\n\nThat attempted coup is more than enough evidence for Meyers to argue Donald Trump won’t change. Yet Republicans still think “the path to power in their party requires fully embracing Donald Trump and his lies about the 2020 election,” according to “A Closer Look.”\n\nThe Late Night host points to Georgia gubernatorial candidate David Perdue and Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance. Meyers highlights Perdue’s willingness to repeat baseless claims about election fraud as well as how Vance backed off his criticism of Trump to get his endorsement.\n\nMeyers wraps up the segment by arguing that the GOP is being held captive by a cult led by Donald Trump.

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:37'}

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge’s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called “this enormous threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac166314b8679c166f4e126f34de9b87e912373/0_296_5889_3533/master/5889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4c7c29ca50ead9e29c1693f5d2a70d2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:55'}

First authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, the pills were in short supply, but delivery of the antiviral has since been accelerated.\n\nThe White House is also launching more "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can be tested and, if they are found to have the coronavirus, receive free oral antiviral pills in one visit.\n\nWeijia Jiang and Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/7006ff90-54ea-49ba-9d2c-4923af685a41/thumbnail/1200x630/cfc42b48f711d609ccb0cb2de59c8519/gettyimages-1240137772.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:38'}

No, I mean, come on! Freedom?!”\n\nThat post was reportedly moved for promoting “violence and incitement.”\n\n“MRC Free Speech America tallied 646 cases in its CensorTrack database of pro-Biden censorship. … The tally included cases from Biden’s presidential candidacy to the present day,” MRC said. “The worst cases of censorship involved platforms targeting anyone who dared to speak about any subject related to the New York Post bombshell Hunter Biden story.”\n\n“The Post investigated Hunter Biden and the Biden family’s allegedly corrupt foreign business dealings. Big Tech’s cancellation of that story helped shift the 2020 election in Biden’s favor,” it added.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted Facebook and Twitter for comment.\n\nIt comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Monday clinched a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion cash.

The two men were amicable in public, and White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed the pair "talk regularly" and that their kinship is not "a relationship of obligation."\n\nDuring the Obama years, many believed the presidential duo had a tight-knit relationship. A comic book writer portrayed the pair as a superhero team in the 2016 book, The Adventures of Barry & Joe: Obama and Biden\'s Bromantic Battle for the Soul of America.\n\nObama refrained from endorsing Biden during his 2020 campaign until it became clear he would clinch the Democratic nomination. At the time, Biden claimed that "everyone knows I’m close with him" and "I don’t need an Obama endorsement," Politico reported. But speculation began to brew that Obama was reluctant to endorse Biden and that he had doubts about Biden\'s ability to carry out the duties of the presidency.\n\n"Don’t underestimate Joe’s ability to f*** things up," Obama told a confidant during the 2020 cycle, according to the outlet.\n\n“He may have said that.

Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number.\n\nAlready the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House.\n\nMonths ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug Paxlovid against COVID.=-19 from the manufacturer Pfizer is lying on a table. Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.”\n\nNow, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nJapan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill.\n\n“We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.”\n\nComplicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.\n\nLast month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.\n\nAdministration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.\n\nThe funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.\n\nModerna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses.\n\nEarlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.\n\nRepublicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.\n\nThere are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage.\n\nSuch a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.\n\nRepublicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.\n\nIt would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.\n\n___', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6267ba122300002bf413a7d4.jpeg?cache=WRFAs9cO4t&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next.

She “has not been a close contact” of President Biden or first lady Jill Biden, the vice president’s office said, citing their travel schedules.\n\n“She has exhibited no symptoms, will isolate and continue to work from the Vice President’s residence,” Harris spokeswoman Kirsten Allen said in a statement.\n\n“She will follow CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines and the advice of her physicians.

She returned from Los Angeles on Monday.\n\nAshish Jha, White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said that he is not privy to conversations about if Harris is receiving therapeutics in light of her positive test. He also cited the importance of vaccinations and therapeutics in dealing with the spread of the BA.2 variant.\n\n“If you take a step back and look at the vice president, she is boosted, actually twice boosted. We have a very, very contagious variant out there. It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America. That’s not even a policy goal. The goal of our policy should be, obviously minimize infection whenever possible but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill,” he said.\n\nHarris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, became the first member of the first and second couples to contract COVID-19. He tested positive on March 15, which lead to a flurry of questions over Harris’s contact and if she should be wearing a mask around the president and others. She continued to test negative during Emhoff’s stint with the coronavirus.\n\nTwo Democratic senators also tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday: Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.).\n\nEarlier this month, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had the coronavirus, as did Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nThe White House recently first acknowledged that Biden could get COVID-19 amid the uptick in positive cases surrounding the president earlier this month.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it’s just a matter of time, but I of course it is possible that the president, like every other American, could get COVID,” Jha said on Tuesday. “There is no 100 percent anything.”\n\nPsaki was asked to respond to a hypothetical question about the line of succession if Biden were to also get COVID-19 and both he and Harris become “very ill.”\n\n“Well, technically the Speaker of the House is the third in line. So, there you go. No, I’m just confirming that for you. It is true, as we’ve noted many times, it is possible the president could test positive. We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen,” Psaki said.\n\nShe added though that she thinks Biden would be able to continue his presidential duties if he were to test positive.\n\n“He has access to the best health care in the world, and we believe, because of all the precautions and steps we have taken that he would be able to continue his duties, as the vice president is as well as vice president,” she said.\n\nOfficials stress that he is vaccinated, and Psaki said last week last week that it wouldn’t be a failure of the precautions in place to protect Biden if he were to get the virus.\n\nPsaki on Tuesday told reporters not to expect updates to protocols, including masking protocols, within the White House in light of Harris’ positive test.\n\nShe noted there is a regular testing cadence for the president and vice president, as well as officials around them, and that there is social distancing in meetings and a number of aides choose to wear masks.\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/harriskamala_031522_ap_manuel_balce_ceneta.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:55'}

The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP. She told one House Republican that while she would never switch parties, her father would be delighted if she did,' the authors write.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) 'boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP,' according to a new book\n\nThe book also delves into President Joe Biden's governing woes – including prolonged talks with Sinema, whom the authors dub an 'aloof Arizonan.' She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House.

He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot.

Mo Brooks, Brooks released a statement saying Trump had approached him with the idea.\n\n'President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,' Brooks said in a statement.\n\n'As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks.

But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man.'\n\nTrump took back his endorsement in the Alabama Senate primary, citing Brooks' call for people to put the 2020 election 'behind you.'\n\nLindell, who was advised Trump inside the White House in the last days of his presidency, has also repeatedly touted the idea.\n\nOther passages in the book reveal how Vice President Kamala Harris quickly learned not to come between President Biden and his negotiations with Congress.\n\nThe authors recount one episode where the president snapped at her so harshly even Republican senators in the meeting were shocked.\n\nIn a meeting last May, Biden tried to persuade Republican lawmakers to support $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nAnd while Biden was ready for a compromise, Harris thought the bill was skimpy.\n\n'Harris thought that there was something missing from the conversation,' according to the book.\n\nShe began turning the conversation toward Democratic priorities, including family and social spending, which were originally included in the larger Build Back Better bill.\n\nShe 'began to make the case for a larger package than the one Republicans seemed to have in mind.'\n\n'Biden dismissed her comment immediately,' the authors wrote, in so harsh a tone 'that even the Republican senators were taken aback.'\n\nBiden was typically 'scrupulously respectful' of his second-in-command, but the moment revealed that infrastructure negotiations were his and his alone.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/17/57074033-0-image-a-35_1650989503049.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:39'}

Intelligence officials told Stefanik the question would be better answered by law enforcement.\n\nStefanik’s query, shared with The Associated Press by a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the classified meeting, reflects a widespread sentiment in the GOP that questions about the financial dealings of President Joe Biden’s son remain unanswered. And they say they intend to do something about it.\n\nAs Republicans prepare for a possible return to power amid rising hopes of winning the House and the Senate in the November elections, they are laying the groundwork to make Hunter Biden and his business dealings a central target of their investigative and oversight efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden’s memoir ‘Beautiful Things’ publishes in April\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staff have discussed analyzing specific messages and financial transactions found on the laptop and have also discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities involved in paying Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The conversations have been in the early stages but have included talks of bringing on Republican lawyers and former Justice Department officials to help lead the investigations, the people said.\n\nThe White House in turn is preparing to defend the Democratic president from any allegations of wrongdoing and make the case that Republicans are driven by opportunism. Democrats are likely to point out how Republicans did not seek investigations into President Donald Trump’s own business pursuits in Russia and China or into the foreign dealings of his children and son-in-law while they held key campaign or White House roles.\n\nIt all raises the possibility of a messy, politically explosive showdown between a GOP-controlled Congress and the White House, one that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nHunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”\n\nJoe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House declined to comment, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to an email.\n\nRepublican leaders see Hunter Biden as a unifying force that can bring together different factions of the GOP and potentially satiate those calling for more dramatic action. Some members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus have said the first order of business for a Republican majority should be an impeachment trial of Joe Biden in retaliation for the two impeachments of Trump.\n\nThere’s also increasing discussion among Republicans about urging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden says he’s facing federal investigation over ‘tax affairs’\n\n“Hunter Biden’s fair game because I believe Hunter Biden is a national security risk,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is in line to take over the House Oversight Committee if Republicans win the House. “Hopefully, when I get the gavel, we’ll take it a step further.”\n\nIn preparation, Comer’s oversight staff has already begun to make document requests and archived information related to the president’s son.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in October 2020 that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. The Kremlin had also interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee now want to probe the origins of a widely shared letter from 50 former intelligence officials released a week after the New York Post story. The letter claimed the laptop carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation” and suggested that “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”\n\nJoe Biden in the second presidential debate, responding to Trump’s reference to the “laptop from hell,” said “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant.” That statement went further than the letter, though it was immediately and widely reported as having labeled the laptop as disinformation. Trump and many Republicans accused Biden of invoking Russia to avoid scrutiny about his son.\n\nNo evidence has emerged since of any Russian connections to the laptop or the emails. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment of the 2020 election alleged that Russian leader Vladimir Putin authorized multiple efforts in support of Trump. Russian state media amplified “disparaging content” about Biden “including stories centered on his son,” the assessment said, which also alleges Putin had “purview” over the activities of a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, called allegations that the Russians were behind the laptop “absurd.” Stefanik in a statement said “any alleged attempt by the intelligence agencies or intelligence community leadership to portray the facts surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop as misinformation needs to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who in 2020 issued a report on Hunter Biden and his work on behalf of Ukraine gas company Burisma, recently made a presentation on the Senate floor laying out allegations they say the media have ignored but the Justice Department and Congress need to investigate.\n\n“The Biden administration has been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests,” Grassley said.\n\nFor now, the Biden administration and many top Democrats are not commenting publicly on Hunter Biden. But the White House has already reassigned communications staff to prepare to respond to GOP investigations of Hunter Biden and other likely targets, including the origins of the coronavirus and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDemocrats are expected to argue that Hunter Biden is ultimately a distraction to most voters concerned about domestic issues. The current House Oversight chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, previewed that argument in a statement responding to Comer, her Republican counterpart.\n\nSaid Maloney: “I’d hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be more focused on delivering for the American people than on phony outrage.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2022/04/2022-04-18T164916Z_950030436_RC2RPT9FSFOE_RTRMADP_3_RELIGION-EASTER-WHITE-HOUSE-1024x682.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:57'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government....Therefore,Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform.

The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:43'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

Carlson’s account also re-posted a comment from Charlie Kirk saying Levine spent “54 years of his life as a man.”\n\nThe move comes after tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Twitter came to an agreement for Musk to take the company private for $44 billion on Monday.\n\n“A free Twitter would mean a direct challenge to the people in charge of our country’s institutions many of whom are incompetent,” Carlson said on his top-rated Fox News program on Monday evening. “For the first time in years we’ll be able to talk honestly about our leaders. We’ll be able to have the kind of conversations that make democracy possible.”\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter triggered questions about whether certain users, including former President Donald Trump, would return to the platform. Trump, however, told news outlets Monday that he plans on staying with his social media site Truth Social and won’t return to Twitter.\n\n“We’re taking in millions of people, and what we’re finding is that the response on Truth is much better than being on Twitter. Twitter has bots and fake accounts, and we are doing everything we can,” Trump said. So far, Trump has only made one post on Truth Social since it was launched in February 2022.\n\nIn mid-April, Trump told Americano News that “Twitter’s become very boring” in recent months because “they’ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter … a lot of their conservative voices.”\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/09/Tucker-Carlson-debate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:50'}

The twenty-seven member states of the European Union reached an agreement on a new law requiring big online platforms, including social-media companies, to police hate speech and disinformation more effectively. Under the E.U.’s Digital Services Act, European governments now have the power to ask Web platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to remove any content that promotes terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse, or commercial scams. The platforms will also be obliged to prevent the “manipulation of services having an impact on democratic processes and public security.”\n\n“The time of big online platforms behaving like they are ‘too big to care’ is coming to an end,” Thierry Breton, the E.U.’s commissioner for the internal market, declared. If the European authorities see a surge of online disinformation during a crisis, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, they will be able to order social-media companies to take “proportionate and effective measures” to counter the threat. Although the new E.U. agreement stops short of treating online platforms the same as traditional publishers (which may be legally liable for intentionally false content about specific individuals and companies), it will force them to provide users with “an easy and effective way” to flag harmful content, so that it can be removed. The platforms will also be subject to annual audits by European regulators on their efforts to counter disinformation and other abuses. Platforms that violate the new law can be fined billions of dollars, and repeat offenders may even be banned from doing business in the E.U.\n\nIronically, the E.U. members adopted the new measures only days before the board of directors of Twitter entered into an agreement to sell the company to Elon Musk, a self-styled defender of free speech and a vigorous opponent of government regulation, for about forty-four billion dollars. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders,” Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, who is also the co-C.E.O. of the software company Salesforce, said in a statement.\n\nEvidently, financial considerations overrode any reservations that the members of Twitter’s board may have had about selling the company to Musk, who has frequently criticized its management and demanded changes in how the site operates. Musk’s bid of fifty-four dollars and twenty cents a share represents a premium of close to forty per cent over the firm’s stock price on April 1st, immediately before he disclosed that he had acquired a nine-per-cent stake in the company. But, even though the financial logic of the deal is straightforward, the implications of Musk taking control of Twitter are, from a broader perspective, potentially highly problematic, especially since he still hasn’t answered some pressing questions about his intentions for the site, including whether he plans to allow Donald Trump back onto it.\n\n[Support The New Yorker’s award-winning journalism. Subscribe today »]\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Musk said that he wanted “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” These aren’t necessarily bad ideas. Allowing users to edit tweets and authenticating their identities could conceivably improve Twitter. The idea of opening up Twitter’s algorithm also sounds benign, although it could clash with the goal of defeating the bots, because once the spammers know Twitter’s formula for serving up tweets they may be better able to game it.\n\nBut none of Musk’s suggestions addressed the fundamental issue of which approach Twitter will now take toward content moderation. Will the company maintain the heavy investments in artificial intelligence and human monitors that it has made in recent years? Will it expand these monitoring efforts as demanded by the new European law? Or will it move in the other direction, dismantling them and allowing the return of former users it had suspended or banned, particularly Trump?\n\nBased on the signs so far, the answer to the last question is yes, Trump and others who have been banned will return. Even though Trump currently insists that he won’t return even if he is invited—he has his own social-media app to promote—many of his supporters are openly celebrating the news of Musk’s takeover. During a staff meeting on Monday, a Twitter employee asked Parag Agrawal, the firm’s chief executive, whether Trump would be allowed back. “We constantly evolve our policies,” Agrawal replied. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know what direction this company will go in.”\n\nBased on some of his public statements, Musk seems intent on taking Twitter back to the not at all distant era when social media was a free-for-all. “I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things,” he said, in an interview earlier this month. If Twitter does go in this direction, it could encounter pushback from corporate advertisers that don’t like being associated with disinformation, incitement, and controversy. Musk has suggested that Twitter should grow its subscriptions base to become less dependent on advertisers, but it’s not clear how many people would pay to use the site, especially if its contents are largely unfiltered.\n\nMusk has also said that his pursuit of Twitter is driven by the desire to protect free speech and “help freedomn in the world” rather than to make money. These are fine-sounding words, but it sometimes seems as if Musk’s notion of free speech amounts to attacking and lampooning anybody who challenges him, including the financial regulators who charged him with securities fraud and fined him twenty million dollars for tweeting misleading information in 2018 about a possible buyout of Tesla. “Even as Twitter’s board on Monday was debating his offer . . . Mr. Musk was setting the tone for his leadership by tweeting that Securities and Exchange Commission officials were ‘shameless puppets,’ ” Greg Bensinger, a member of the Times’ editorial board, noted. Last week, Musk used his Twitter account, which has about eighty-five million followers, to try fat-shaming Bill Gates, whom he also accused of speculating against Tesla’s stock.\n\nIn a column for the Guardian, Robert Reich, a former U.S. Secretary of Labor, argued that Musk’s real goal in purchasing Twitter is to create a position for himself where he is unaccountable to anything, from laws to market competition. Whether that’s entirely accurate or not, the pending takeover provides yet another confirmation that Congress needs to treat the big online platforms like the social utilities they are, and regulate them. A first step would be to pass the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, in January. This legislation would prohibit dominant platforms, such as Amazon and Google, from exploiting their market power to boost their own products by discriminating against their competitors.\n\nRegulating content in a manner consistent with protecting free speech may be a trickier proposition, but the E.U. has just provided a road map for how it could be done: by putting the onus on social-media companies to monitor and remove harmful content, and hit them with big fines if they don’t. The Digital Services Act is “nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation,” Ben Scott, the executive director of the advocacy group Reset, told the Associated Press. “It’s the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic systems in digital media markets.”\n\nMusk would surely object to the U.S. adopting a regulatory system like the one that the Europeans are drawing up, but that’s too bad. The health of the Internet—and, most important, democracy—is too significant to leave to one man, no matter how rich he is.', 'image': 'https://media.newyorker.com/photos/626806ef6d0339f5142c2b06/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cassidy-musk-twitter.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:20'}

The constitutional protection of speech does not, on its own, engender a society in which the chance to be heard is truly abundant and free and equitably distributed.\n\n“Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep,” Mr. Berlin once said. This is a point often lost on Americans. Government — or large centralized authority — is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn’t censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous.

The president has not done that. The president has committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any kind of "\n\nHagerty then reportedly cut Garland off to highlight recent instances in which the president\'s advisers defended Hunter Biden publicly.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain appeared on ABC\'s "This Week" program just two days after a federal grand jury reportedly heard testimony about Hunter Biden\'s cash flow, while serving on the board of Ukraine energy company Burisma. Klain said: "Of course the president\'s confident that his son didn\'t break the law."\n\nAlso, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged a media question Monday, inquiring about a New York Post report of a Hunter Biden business associate (Eric Schwerin, the former president of Hunter Biden\'s investment firm Rosemont Seneca) visiting the White House 19 separate times from 2009-13.\n\nThe potential relevance here: President Biden has previously stated he has "never spoken" to Hunter Biden, or any of his financial partners, about outside business deals.\n\nLater in the Senate hearing, Hagerty asked Garland whether Americans "can be confident that this administration is conducting a serious investigation."\n\nGarland answered in the affirmative, adding, "Because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters."\n\nEmails from Hunter Biden\'s laptop reportedly indicate Schwerin had access to Joe Biden\'s personal finances, including being involved with the elder Biden\'s taxes and discussing the then-vice president\'s financial future with him.\n\nIn 2019, the FBI seized control of a Hunter Biden laptop left in a Delaware-based repair shop. The contents of the laptop have yet to be released to the public, in full; but last month, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., successfully included the hard-drive components of Hunter Biden\'s captured laptop into the Congressional Record.\n\nThe current Hunter Biden probe has since been expanded to possible acts of money laundering and the violation of lobbying laws, according to reports. Last week, the Washington Post confirmed that in 2017 and 2018, Hunter Biden and the president\'s brother, James Biden, controlled $4.8 million in payments from a Chinese energy conglomerate.\n\nEarlier in April, a witness in the Hunter Biden grand jury proceedings was asked about Biden\'s deal with CEFC China Energy Co., along with the identity of "the big guy" during sworn testimony in Wilmington, Delaware, according to a New York Post report.\n\nCiting the Post report, a source familiar with the grand jury\'s work says the question had been posed after the witness was shown a piece of evidence, which included the cryptic query of "10 held by H for the big guy."\n\nThe line of grand-jury questioning follows up a separate New York Post report from October 2020, when James Gilliar, a former business partner to Hunter Biden, outlined the proposed percentage distribution of equity in a company that was created as a joint venture with CEFC China Energy Co.\n\nAt his 2020 impeachment trial, then-President Donald Trump\'s defense team cited Obama-era visitor logs that indicated Biden met with his son\'s business partner Devon Archer, April 16, 2014 — around the time Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he reportedly earned $1 million per year.\n\nAt the time, then-Vice President Joe Biden led U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\nCiting the New York Post report, documents and a photo indicated that Joe Biden attended a 2015 Washington, D.C., dinner with a group of his son\'s associates — including Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi and the Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.\n\nA Senate report from 2020 uncovered that, in 2014, Baturina paid $3.5 million to a firm linked to Hunter Biden.', 'image': 'https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=371c9975-705f-4593-a515-3d893c7330c3&SiteName=Newsmax', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:09'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

If they don\'t know whom to ask, the challenge is even greater. But an even worse error is to decide on an answer before even asking the question — and then refusing to hear any answers that don\'t confirm what they\'ve already decided.\n\nAmerica\'s political class, especially the pundits and commentators, are guilty of all of these errors (and many more) as they continue to willfully not understand the Age of Trump and how America arrived at this democracy crisis. The Republican-fascist movement is winning because so many people who are supposed to know better continue to view simple questions as puzzling and mysterious, and continue to ignore the obvious answers.\n\nMany such voices among the high priesthood of the church of the savvy and the other professional smart people have concluded that the Republican Party is in the midst of a "civil war" or is in "disarray" in the aftermath of Donald Trump\'s presidency. That\'s not true: The Republican Party is "evolving" just as other fascist and authoritarian movements have historically done, largely by purging those who disagree with the Great Leader and his vision.\n\nRELATED: Here\'s why Trump won\'t run in 2024 — and why the Trump cult ultimately can\'t win\n\nMany of the same voices also announce that Trump\'s hold on the Republican-fascist Party and movement is weakening because of diminished attendance at his rallies, or because of rumors and "revelations" about internal resistance surrounding Trump\'s coup plot of Jan. 6, 2021. Those are significant details and facts, but they do not override the basic reality that Trump continues to be the leader of the Republican Party and the larger neofascist movement. He received millions more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016, and until he decides otherwise he is the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nRepublican voters and right-leaning independents continue to view Trump and what he represents as the identity and brand name of today\'s Republican Party and "conservative" movement. Moreover, the 2024 election is more than two years away and traditional barometers of Trump\'s popularity cannot be seen as reliably predictive.\n\nMaybe the media\'s worst misreading is the claim that Trump led the Republican Party astray. In fact, he set it free — to follow its worst impulses.\n\nBut those questions pale compared to the grandest misreading of all: the claim that Trump and Trumpism led the Republican Party astray from its core values, and by doing so "sabotaged" it. Reality is quite different: Trump and his neofascist right-wing populist movement set modern-day Republican leaders and voters free to embrace their antisocial, anti-human, anti-democratic, reactionary, racist, sexist, plutocratic, theocratic, conspiracist, anti-intellectual and anti-rational values and beliefs. Trumpism was not suddenly born ex nihilo in 2015; it has been at least 30 years in the making.\n\nUltimately, what America\'s political class, the punditry and most of the mainstream news media refuse to understand is that Donald Trump is simultaneously a man, a symbol, and a cult-leader who embodies a form of freedom — specifically, the freedom to indulge in the worst aspects of human behavior and then to wallow in the chaos and pain and suffering that result. Like other forms of fascism, Trumpism is exhilarating for followers and believers; it gives their lives purpose, meaning and a sense of community, largely by inflicting pain for those designated as its enemies.\n\nIn a recent column at Salon, longtime White House reporter Brian Karem summarizes Trump\'s hold over his followers and their devotion to him:\n\nTrump has played it close to the vest as he has traveled across the country to a variety of rallies, pitching baubles and trinkets to dazzle and amaze those of simple minds and limited funds. Buy a hat. Buy a shirt. Buy an ornament. Buy an autographed picture. Buy anything Trump is selling — probably up to and including autographed underwear. Millions continue to support him by buying his cheap and tawdry knickknacks. It makes me wonder what these homes look like. "Come in. clean your feet on the Trump doormat, hang up your coat on the Trump coat rack. Have a seat and a complimentary beverage out of our Trump lemonade pitcher, poured lovingly into a Trump autographed mug." Meanwhile, you can take a look at a phone video shot by Donald Trump Jr. inviting you to visit a "top secret" rally with his father — and, gosh, even get a chance to meet Dad! What the hell is a top secret rally? Isn\'t that what the KKK used to do?\n\nThe following observation is no doubt a challenging concept for those still wedded to "normal politics" and other obsolescent ways of thinking: "Donald Trump" is of immense symbolic importance, but Donald Trump the human being barely even matters. As I detailed in an earlier essay for Salon, "Donald Trump is no longer a mere person. Indeed, to some extent the human being behind the Trump persona has become irrelevant." In other words, Trump is integral to the American neofascist project — but he is also disposable and can be replaced as the situation demands.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nIf the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. For too many people in America\'s political class and the news media, especially, the only lens available to interpret politics is through horserace-style coverage, centrism bias, outmoded notions of balance and fairness, questions about who has "coattails" and is piling up "endorsements," and of course the results of public opinion polls and focus groups. To acknowledge that these habits and tools no longer have the explanatory power they once did (not very long ago) would be an enormous psychological leap, approaching epistemic collapse.\n\nHere are three examples of how strongly Donald Trump\'s power endures, whatever the hope-peddlers, professional centrists and others among the commentariat would like us to believe:\n\n1. The Republican Party announced last week that it will no longer participate in the 2024 presidential debates hosted by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nDebates serve an important function in a democracy and as such have played a key role in many elections. They are especially important for helping low information, independent and relatively apolitical voters decide whom to support. Beyond that, participation in a debate signals a commitment to democratic norms and institutions. Debates also reaffirm a shared belief in the principle that truth exists outside of partisanship and ideology.\n\nFascists and other authoritarians reject such consensus values. By rejecting the presidential debates, and replacing them with some type of right-wing propaganda theater, the Republican Party is choosing to protect Donald Trump (or his successors) from public scrutiny. Paul Waldman of the Washington Post offered this context:\n\nThe Republican Party has just offered us a glimpse of the hell they\'re going to put us all through in 2024. What might appear to be a petty argument about the conditions under which general election debates will or won\'t be held is actually much more…. But it\'s also a sign that the Republican strategy will again feature chaotic, Trumpian whining that is meant to delegitimize the entire presidential campaign process from start to finish, culminating in an attempt to take back the White House by theft if the voters don\'t vote the "right" way. Let\'s remember that while Trump performed well in the 2016 primary debates when he was on stage with a collection of empty suits, he did poorly in every one of his debates with Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. By the fall of 2024, he\'ll be 78 years old; the idea that he\'ll be more disciplined and focused than he was in the past is far-fetched. Everything Americans dislike about him would be on vivid display in a debate, before the largest audience the candidates will have. If Republicans announce now, two-and-a-half years in advance, that they\'re refusing to participate in the debates, it could save them a last-minute act of cowardice. But the more important reason they\'re doing this is to reinforce the idea that every institution and practice associated with the presidential campaign must be considered corrupt and biased against Trump and therefore illegitimate, whether it\'s the news media, the debates, maybe even the weather — and especially the vote counting.\n\n2. Republicans are enthusiastically doing the bidding of Donald Trump and his fascist project.\n\nWe see this through growing support for the Jan. 6 coup attempt and the Capitol attack, the escalating assault on democracy and voting rights, the moral panic around "critical race theory"; anti-LGBTQ bigotry and related conspiracy theories, the campaign to roll back reproductive rights and freedoms, the assault on free speech and other fundamental civil and human rights, the war on reason and critical thinking, the Big Lie, and the support (covert or otherwise) for right-wing authoritarians such as Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán.\n\nThe embrace of racism and the attack on reproductive rights and LGBTQ equality are not "top-down" politics. Republican voters overwhelmingly embrace those views.\n\nThis is not a story of "top-down" politics, or elites otherwise imposing their values on a public. Republican voters overwhelmingly support these policies and the values they embody. Donald Trump is a gifted political entrepreneur; he understood that many tens of millions of Americans yearn for fascism or some other form of authoritarian rule.\n\n3. To this point, Republican leaders and candidates are still in thrall to Trump. They must prostrate themselves before him and seek his blessing as a pathway to power.\n\nIn a recent article for the New York Times, Shane Goldmacher details how Trump continues to rule the Republican Party and the larger neofascist movement from his Mar-a-Lago retreat:\n\nFor 15 months, a parade of supplicants — senators, governors, congressional leaders and Republican strivers of all stripes — have made the trek to pledge their loyalty and pitch their candidacies. Some have hired Mr. Trump\'s advisers, hoping to gain an edge in seeking his endorsement. Some have bought ads that ran only on Fox News in South Florida. Some bear gifts; others dish dirt. Almost everyone parrots his lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Working from a large wooden desk reminiscent of the one he used in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has transformed Mar-a-Lago\'s old bridal suite into a shadow G.O.P. headquarters, amassing more than $120 million — a war chest more than double that of the Republican National Committee itself. ... And while other past presidents have ceded the political stage, Mr. Trump has done the opposite, aggressively pursuing an agenda of vengeance against Republicans who have wronged him, endorsing more than 140 candidates nationwide and turning the 2022 primaries into a stress test of his continued sway. ... "Party leaders have never played the role that Trump is playing," said Roger Stone, an on-and-off adviser to Mr. Trump since the 1980s who has been spotted at Mar-a-Lago of late. "Because he can — and he\'s not bound by the conventional rules of politics."\n\nGoldmacher raises the question of whether Trump\'s "big public profile" will be "a potent turnoff for swing voters" in the fall election, which remains to be seen. But in Republican primaries, "few serious candidates are openly breaking" with him. Former Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn says Trump\'s conquest of the party "has been so complete ... that even the RINOs are attempting to talk MAGA."\n\n"Few see an expiration date" on Trump\'s dominance of the Republican Party, Goldmacher concludes, "until and unless he declines to run again in 2024 or is defeated." GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has reportedly told Trump, "We need you."\n\nIs that a portrait of a fascist leader whose power is in decline? With a war chest estimated at $120 million and a right-wing disinformation media machine largely at his command, at this moment Donald Trump is the Republican Party. The fact that some members of the political and media classes read Goldmacher\'s story as announcing the end of the Trump era only reflects the biased and distorted view of reality that led America to this ugly situation in the first place.\n\nAccording to traditional Christian theology, the devil\'s greatest trick was to convince the people of the world that he does not exist. Trump is perhaps only a lesser demon. But do not be fooled by the claim that he is no longer a threat. If America\'s political elites fall for that trick, it will likely mean the end of the country\'s democracy.\n\nRead more on our 45th president:', 'image': 'https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media.salon.com/2021/07/donald-trump-faded-american-flag-0718211.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:44'}

It plunged when he joked about it on air on Saturday Night Live last May. In December, it went up when he said Tesla would accept the coin as payment for merchandise.\n\nThe 'joke' crypto that started as a meme... what is Dogecoin? Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created as a 'joke' in 2013. Its mascot is a Shiba Inu dog, made popular from the 'doge' meme featuring photos of the canine overlaid with text written in broken English. It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke. 'I'm half detached, but it's weird that something I made in a few hours is now part of internet culture,' he said. 'It's amusing to see Elon Musk talk about it. It feels silly, but there's this huge upwelling behind it.'

Co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) holds a board seat, but is expected to give it up in May\n\nMusk is known for using Twitter to post inflammatory messages, much like former President Donald Trump.\n\nParag Agrawal, the CEO, said on Monday that it was up to Musk to decide whether to readmit Trump.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would not be rejoining the site if Musk allowed him to - instead saying he would continue to use his own TRUTH Social.\n\nSome experts are pointing to a tough road ahead for Twitter if Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, gets his way.\n\n'We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.\n\nThe 16-year old company, which has emerged as one of the world's most influential online public squares with about over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.\n\n'The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,' Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.\n\nTesla tycoon versus Big Tech: How swashbuckling billionaire Elon Musk fought off 'poison pill', lawsuits and hostile board of directors before $44bn Twitter takeover\n\nIt has been one of the most dramatic takeover attempts in history, seeing a swashbuckling billionaire pitted against one of the largest tech giants in the world.\n\nBut Elon Musk's seizing of Twitter has been a months-long pursuit that has seen him send shockwaves through the world of business.\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online.\n\nHe quickly rocketed to the top of its shareholders' list, acquiring a huge 9% stake in the tech giant.\n\nBut then he hit choppy waters, accepting a place on the board then rejecting it, getting embroiled in lawsuits and seeing rival companies circle to buy Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile bosses at the social media firm appeared to do all they could to ensure he could not not seize it - even launching a 'poison pill' strategy to sink his chances.\n\nYet Musk brazenly blasted through all the obstacles, punting a $43 billion offer earlier this month and showing how he would finance it.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning on Monday to finalize the 'fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nIt saw Twitter shares in the US soar by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share.\n\nOn Monday, Musk called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means'.\n\nHere, DailyMail.com looks at the rollercoaster journey he has been on over the last few months as he seizes his prize.\n\n\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online\n\nJanuary 31: Musk hoards Twitter shares and buys them 'almost daily'\n\nMusk started buying Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1, according to an SEC filing.\n\nJust days earlier, he told his 80 million followers on the site he was ' giving serious thought ' to creating his own social media platform.\n\nA user asked him: 'Would you consider building a new social media platform, @elonmusk?\n\n'One that would consist an open source algorithm, one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority, one where propaganda is very minimal. I think that kind of a platform is needed.'\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO replied through his official account: 'Am giving serious thought to this.'\n\nThe billionaire businessman, 50, appeared to be suggesting he was sick of Twitter over the right to freedom of speech.\n\nApril 4: Musk says he bought 9.2 percent stake in firm a month earlier\n\nMusk revealed he had purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant on March 14.\n\nHe tweeted 'oh hi lol' after the news sent shockwaves through the business world and across social media. He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:05:10'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription.

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:56'}

TWTR -3.91% will need to follow the bloc’s new rules for tackling illegal and harmful content online if it wants to keep operating there, marking a possible challenge to Elon Musk’s plans to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation.\n\nThierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, said Tuesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it’s his job to make sure companies, including Twitter, understand their obligations in Europe. That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online. It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nThe text of the new law still needs formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries, but it is unlikely to change substantially from what lawmakers agreed to last week.\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence in a post on Twitter earlier Tuesday that the company under Mr. Musk’s ownership would conform to the EU’s new rules.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Mr. Breton wrote. “Mr Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter could mark an eventual test case for the EU’s new legislation once it comes into effect, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank.

In his own statement, Bennett warned Biden not to accede to Iranian demands to remove the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps from the U.S. designated terrorist list. Biden is said to be opposed to delisting the IRGC, but Iran is holding out for delisting as a condition for the U.S. reentry into the Iran nuclear deal, a key Biden foreign policy objective.\n\n“I am sure that President Biden, who is a true friend of Israel and cares about its security, will not allow the IRGC to be removed from the list of terrorist organizations,” Bennett said in his statement. “Israel has clarified its position on the issue: The IRGC is the largest terrorist organization in the world.”\n\nThe visit, which both offices said would happen within months, comes at a time when both leaders face political pressures: Biden is unpopular and Democrats might lose one or both chambers in Congress in the midterm elections.

The world\'s wealthiest man offered to buy the social media site for $44 billion, and the company\'s board accepted the offer yesterday.\n\nMusk has many reasons for buying the company, but his main drive appears to be to preserve—or even strengthen—the site\'s commitment to the principles of free speech.\n\n"Twitter is the digital town square, where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," tweeted Musk.\n\nAdmittedly, the town square analogy is imperfect, as my colleague Liz Wolfe highlighted in her excellent post on the subject. For one thing, Twitter is a private company, rather than a genuinely public space, which means that it is not bound by the First Amendment. Unlike the actual town square, Twitter retains the right to punish users for perfectly legal speech. It\'s also the case that while Twitter is incredibly important for the political class, journalists, business leaders, and other social influencers, it\'s not nearly as big or as frequently visited as Facebook, YouTube, or TikTok. As Techdirt\'s Mike Masnick put it, the entire internet is really the town square; Twitter is one small space that\'s part of it.\n\nTwitter\'s social importance is inflated by media and political figures because the site is their preferred virtual meeting ground. This is true of Musk himself; he clearly enjoys the platform, and uses it to great effect, and thus may be overstating its importance to society. But there are many others ways to communicate political messages, and if Twitter ceased to exist tomorrow, it\'s doubtful that anyone\'s ability to speak would be irreparably harmed.\n\nAdmittedly, the people really overstating Twitter\'s importance are actually Musk\'s critics in progressive and mainstream media. And boy are they overstating it: Current Affairs Editor in Chief Nathan Robinson fretted that "the only comforting reason to think [former President] Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable."\n\nThe only comforting reason to think Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable. — Nathan J Robinson (@NathanJRobinson) April 25, 2022\n\nRobinson apparently thinks that Trump\'s ability to win reelection hinges on whether he\'s on Twitter. Not the shape of the U.S. economy, the direction of the pandemic, or whether President Joe Biden\'s ill-considered policies have created an opening for the former president…but Twitter.\n\nFrustratingly, many liberals and progressives—especially in the media—have convinced themselves that the only way to effectively counter bad speech is to label it misinformation or harassment and prevent it from being uttered. This runs counter to Musk\'s stated views on the subject, which reflect classically liberal ideas about speech.\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nIt\'s strange to see this idea—that silencing opponents is not only self-defeating but also wrong on principle—transformed into an explicitly right-wing talking point. This is a demoralizing result of the new political reality, in which the journalists and bureaucrats who comprise Team Blue fear and distrust speech they cannot control, while Team Red purports to love free speech even as its political figures wage war on speech they do not like. And it\'s one that does not work to Democrats\' advantage; as Nate Silver points out, free speech in the abstract is extremely popular among the voting public.\n\nThe best way to de-politicize the social media free speech debate—and the optimal thing that Musk could do with control of Twitter—would be to devolve content curation to individual users, as I explained in The Los Angeles Times:\n\n"Elon Musk\'s best bet would be to devolve content curation to individual users. Many on the right are frustrated with Twitter\'s inconsistently applied rules, regardless of whether they are enforced by algorithms or by human employees of the company; many progressives, on the other hand, are afraid that lax moderation means more misinformation or harassment. The least polarizing way forward is to give users more means of controlling their own feeds. If you have a low tolerance for unpleasantness, you should be able to turn on a setting that shields you from the worst of what can appear on the platform. If you prefer the Wild West, there should be a setting for you, too."\n\nIn any case, I hope that fixing Twitter doesn\'t distract Musk from his far more important goal of colonizing Mars (something NPR criticized as imperialist, because of course they did).

Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:39'}

Trump feeds on attention and will once again disseminate his cries through Twitter’s unholy megaphone, just not right away. For the moment, it’s more expedient for Trump to promote his social network, which I promise virtually nobody will ever ever use. As of early April, TRUTH reportedly had just north of 500,000 daily active users, paling in comparison to Twitter’s 217 million or so DAUs, as Vanity Fair pointed out yesterday. Sure, the former president has the power to juice an app’s ranking for, say, a few weeks, but check back in a year and you’ll see what I mean.\n\nBut looking ahead, when Trump’s 2024 campaign kicks into high gear, do you think he’ll choose loyalty to TRUTH Social, of all things, over Twitter and its outsized media reach? No. Trump is not loyal to anything. Given the chance, he will return. Next question.\n\nHow can we know Musk will lift the ban? He hasn’t said anything, has he?\n\nMusk has said enough, but please, allow me a moment to backtrack.\n\nWhen Twitter banned Trump, some of the president’s thirstiest supporters protested the move in defense of “free speech,” arguing that the safeguard against government overreach should also cover drivel on Twitter’s website. This is absurd, but Musk’s views on free speech and content moderation pretty much jive with their outlook, and conservatives know it. (Personally, I’d rather build a hospitable town square that people want to visit, versus one that celebrates these weirdos, but that wouldn’t be very Twitter, would it?)\n\nInstead of wading into the nitty gritty of content moderation, for example, Musk seemingly wants to feel it out and hopes even his “worst critics” stick around to post. If that’s what he’s focused on, then why wouldn’t he also welcome Rosie O’Donnell’s worst critic back into the fold?\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nAt least Jack trusts Elon, right?\n\nIt sure sounds like he does! Not long after Twitter’s board accepted Musk’s offer, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey spoke up in support of the website’s incoming acquirer. After a strong caveat that, “in principal,” he does not “believe anyone should own or run Twitter,” Dorsey said that “Elon is the singular solution I trust” when it comes to “solving for the problem of it being a company.” And believe me, you can trust Musk — to singularly shrug and subject us to @RealDonaldTrump all over again.\n\nTwitter’s decision to ban Trump in the first place came down to just two tweets, and hinged primarily on their timing and context following the January 6 riot. That’s shaky ground to begin with. Add in Musk’s management and posting ideology, which is not compatible with fussy concepts such as nuance, and baby, you’ve got a stew going. Instead, the serial CEO is far too busy union busting, hating on critics and doing things for the lolz to concern himself with ideals like community health or treating people with dignity.', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229173793.jpg?w=600', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:05'}

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:59'}

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 0 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular amongst Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end, but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even amongst his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nPresently we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remember that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment after years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared to Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://www.lifesitenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1354093065.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:44'}

(Jn 8:32)\n\nAnd so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square.\n\nThank you for SIGNING and SHARING this petition to Elon Musk, urging him to now reinstate LifeSiteNews\' suspended Twitter accounts.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\n\'Free speech advocate Elon Musk buys Twitter for $44 billion\' - https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/breaking-elon-musk-buys-twitter\n\n\'Twitter suspends two LifeSite accounts for calling ‘transgender woman’ a man\' - https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/twitter-suspends-two-lifesite-accounts-for-calling-transgender-woman-a-man/\n\n\'Do Catholics need a ‘free speech champion’ like Elon Musk?\' - https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/do-catholics-need-a-free-speech-champion-like-elon-musk/\n\n**Photo Credit: Shutterstock.com', 'image': 'https://www.lifesitenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/trumpimpeachment.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:06'}

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:50'}

The two visits occurred in room 272 on Feb. 29 and room 276 on Aug. 17 at the Old Executive Office Building (OEOB), according to the 2016 White House visitor logs.\n\nRicchetti has been a longtime adviser to President Biden and served as his chief of staff from 2013 to 2017.

According to White House visitor logs, Schwerin met her in Biden\'s "West Wi[ng]" office on Feb. 24, April 8, and June 9. It is unclear if Biden was present for the meetings.\n\nPerson is not only a former assistant at Rosemont Seneca Partners, but she is also the sister of Francis "Fran" Person, a longtime Biden aide who left the White House a few months after she joined Biden\'s office in May 2014. He served as an advisor to Biden between 2009 and 2014, where he traveled to 49 of the 50 countries Biden visited, including China. FOX Business previously reported on Fran\'s ties to Hunter Biden and Schwerin and how their private equity firm had a financial stake in a company run by Fran and a Chinese executive with ties to officials at some of the highest levels of the Communist Party of China.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Person siblings kept in frequent contact with Hunter and Schwerin during their Obama-Biden administration roles using their government emails, according to emails reviewed by Fox News Digital.\n\nIn addition to Person and Ricchetti, Schwerin made three other visits with staffers from Vice President Biden\'s office in 2016. Schwerin met with John McGrail, who was a counselor to Biden, on July 15 and Sept. 9 at the White House. He also met with Kaitlyn Demers, who was serving as an associate counsel in Biden\'s office in 2016, on June 28.

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,” McCarthy said. “And then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_mayorkasalejandro_042522gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:22'}

(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSchwerin’s involvement in the personal and professional lives of the Biden family was first revealed by the Post citing emails from a laptop abandoned by Hunter Biden at a Delaware computer repair store in April 2019.\n\nThe Post’s initial reporting on the laptop during the 2020 election detailed how Hunter used his father’s political power as leverage in overseas business dealings. The article was banned for a time by Facebook and Twitter, labelled as “unsubstantiated” by other news outlets and as “Russian disinformation” by intelligence agents and members of the Biden campaign.\n\nThe New York Times published a report last month, more than a year after the fact, claiming to authenticate the emails from the laptop by citing anonymous sources.\n\nThe White House has refused to comment on the laptop in the wake of The New York Times article.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are renewing promises to investigate Hunter Biden with the latest revelations about Schwerin’s access to the White House.\n\n”Not everyone gets to meet the vice president of the United States in the White House. The press should be asking why Hunter Biden’s business associates—like Eric Schwerin—had that privilege and were given access to the Obama White House,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told the New York Post. “This is additional evidence that Joe Biden lied when he said he never discussed Hunter’s foreign business dealings. It’s well past time for the corporate media to demand the truth from Joe Biden. The corruption of Biden Inc. must be exposed.”\n\n“It’s increasingly obvious that Hunter Biden’s business revolved around providing access to his father and the highest levers of power.

Seth Meyers took “A Closer Look” at why the GOP continues to embrace Trump even after more damning evidence emerges about the January 6 insurrection.\n\nLate Night with Seth Meyers has long been critical of Republicans and the conservative movement, even outside of the Trump presidency. Countless segments of “A Closer Look” have featured Meyers calling the GOP morally bankrupt and without any real policies.\n\nAny hope that things would change once Donald Trump left the White House has been dashed. Some Republicans in Congress continue to support Trump or parrot his claims about the election. Meanwhile, GOPers running for office remain desperate for Trump’s endorsement.\n\nFor Seth Meyers, this trend becomes harder to understand the more we learn about the events leading up to and immediately following the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Monday night’s “A Closer Look” examined how the GOP still revolves around Donald Trump.\n\nIn A Closer Look, Seth Meyers rips Ivanka Trump, David Perdue, and J.D. Vance\n\nSeth Meyers began “A Closer Look” by recapping a report on thousands of texts among Team Trump between the 2020 election and the January 6 insurrection. Meyers specifically focuses on texts from Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s daughter and adviser.\n\nMeyers compares Ivanka to a Peleton instructor in the way she called Trump’s inner circle “warriors” for their efforts to overturn the election. Even more confusing to Meyers is why Team Trump tried to plan a coup using a group chat.\n\nThat attempted coup is more than enough evidence for Meyers to argue Donald Trump won’t change. Yet Republicans still think “the path to power in their party requires fully embracing Donald Trump and his lies about the 2020 election,” according to “A Closer Look.”\n\nThe Late Night host points to Georgia gubernatorial candidate David Perdue and Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance. Meyers highlights Perdue’s willingness to repeat baseless claims about election fraud as well as how Vance backed off his criticism of Trump to get his endorsement.\n\nMeyers wraps up the segment by arguing that the GOP is being held captive by a cult led by Donald Trump.

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:37'}

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge’s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called “this enormous threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac166314b8679c166f4e126f34de9b87e912373/0_296_5889_3533/master/5889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4c7c29ca50ead9e29c1693f5d2a70d2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

And the Biden administration predicts roughly 12,000 migrants per day will begin crossing the border when Title 42 is lifted. Currently, about half of those migrants encountered are turned back across the border and prevented from seeking asylum. When Title 42 is lifted, immigrants will be allowed to live in the United States while they pursue asylum claims, a process that can take between two to four years.\n\nThe Biden administration says it plans to deport more migrants who do not pass the initial screening for asylum and is working with countries in the region to accept flights returning their citizens.\n\nOne country that has refused to accept back its emigrants is Cuba.

Officials said asylum-seekers fleeing violence will have access to humanitarian protection.\n\nThe updated Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans could alleviate concerns from some Democrats who have implored the administration to develop an adequate border management strategy before ending Title 42, but the preparations could be hindered by a federal court order.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to issue a temporary restraining order blocking officials from winding down Title 42 before May 23. Republican-led states requested the order last week, saying DHS was already phasing out Title 42, including by placing more migrants in expedited removal.\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters about the plan on the condition they not be named, confirmed Tuesday that the U.S. government "will comply with the court order," but added, "we really disagree with the basic premise."\n\n"When the Title 42 order is lifted, we intend to significantly expand the use of expedited removal through our Title 8 authorities and thereby impose long-term law enforcement consequences on those who seek to cross the border without a lawful basis to do so," the official added.\n\nThe official said it "really makes no sense to us" that the court would order DHS to halt expedited removal, arguing that a pause on phasing out Title 42 will prevent the department from "adequately preparing for the aggressive application of immigration law when the public health order expires."\n\nThe administration official said expedited removal would be used to deport some Central Americans back to their home countries, as opposed to expelling them to Mexico under Title 42, which could allow them to attempt to enter the U.S. illegally multiple times.\n\nThe official said U.S. border authorities have started deporting repeat border-crossers under expedited removal, which banishes them from the U.S. for five years, and referring migrants who seek to evade capture to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.\n\nTuesday\'s plan also calls for the detention of migrant adults traveling without children "when appropriate." Administration officials have ruled out detaining migrant families with children, telling reporters Tuesday the practice started under President Barack Obama and expanded under President Donald Trump "is not a tool we are considering now."\n\nThe planned expansion of expedited removal could be restricted by some countries\' refusal to accept U.S. deportations. An administration official said the U.S. is hoping to forge new repatriation collaboration agreements with certain countries that would cut red tape for carrying out deportations.\n\nU.S. officials have historically struggled to return large numbers of migrants to certain countries like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela due to strained relations with their respective governments. In March, a record 32,000 Cubans and 16,000 Nicaraguans entered U.S. border custody, according to CBP data.\n\nAdministration officials characterized last week\'s diplomatic summit with Cuba as "productive," and "the beginning of a good dialogue." The U.S. delegation requested that Cuba once again accept Cuban deportees, while the U.S. agreed to restart immigrant visa processing in Havana, officials said.\n\nThe Biden administration is also asking countries that migrants transit through to help the U.S. reduce the number of arrivals to the Mexican border.\n\n"We\'re also asking that other countries step up and enforce their own immigration laws," one senior administration official said. "We really feel as though we need true responsibility sharing. We can\'t have countries, for instance, participating in controlled flow, where they\'re just allowing individuals to cross through without normal adjudication."\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas during a tour of the Panama Canal at the Miraflores Locks, in Panama City, Panama, on April 19, 2022.

"It\'s quite challenging in dealing with a country like Venezuela, where the diplomatic relations, if they exist at all, can be strained," Mayorkas told CBS News last week. "And so we have to be practical here in addressing the realities."\n\nFor its part, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has currently stationed 23,000 agents along the southwest border, according to Tuesday\'s memo, including 600 recently deployed personnel and law enforcement officers from across government agencies.\n\n"By May 23, we will be prepared to hold approximately 18,000 noncitizens in CBP custody at any given time, up from 13,000 at the beginning of 2021, and we have doubled our ability to transport noncitizens on a daily basis, with flexibility to increase further," the memo reads.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers Tuesday that both the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service will contribute resources to the border mission.\n\n"To be clear, we don\'t do border patrolling," Garland said, noting law enforcement under the purview of the Department of Justice is not trained for immigration enforcement. "But the Bureau of Prisons is going to make buses available for the transfers that Border Patrol needs assistance for. And the Marshall Service is going to be providing additional deputy U.S. Marshals to assist CBP at the border."\n\nThe Defense Department, meanwhile, will provide "rapid contracting support for air and ground transportation," according to a senior administration official, in addition to identifying potential locations for new temporary migrant holding facilities along the southwest border.\n\nOfficials also noted the Department of National Intelligence is "coordinating intelligence gathering and helping to support and strengthen our capability to get an early warning of migrant surges as they are building."\n\nDHS plans to expand the distribution of "age-appropriate" COVID-19 vaccines to migrants at two dozen CBP sites by May 23, in addition to its existing vaccination program for those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.\n\nOfficials also confirmed that MaryAnn Tierney, the regional administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will soon transition out of her short-lived role, where she led the newly established "Southwest Border Coordination Center." The center was established in February, and Mayorkas appointed Tierney shortly thereafter. Officials have yet to formally announce Tierney\'s replacement.\n\nTuesday\'s memo acknowledged "historic levels of migration" to the U.S. border. Apprehensions of migrants along the southern border soared to 221,000 last month, a 22-year high.

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:55'}

Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number.\n\nAlready the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House.\n\nMonths ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug Paxlovid against COVID.=-19 from the manufacturer Pfizer is lying on a table.

Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.”\n\nNow, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nJapan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill.\n\n“We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.”\n\nComplicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.\n\nLast month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.\n\nAdministration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.\n\nThe funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.\n\nModerna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses.\n\nEarlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.\n\nRepublicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.\n\nThere are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage.\n\nSuch a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.\n\nRepublicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.\n\nIt would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.\n\n___', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6267ba122300002bf413a7d4.jpeg?cache=WRFAs9cO4t&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

He was charged in 1964 after he attempted to sell a copy of a Secret Service file and served several years in federal custody, the White House said.\n\nThe president is also pardoning Betty Jo Bogans, a Houston woman who was convicted in 1998 of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine. Bogans, 51, was attempting to transport drugs for her boyfriend and his accomplice, neither of whom were arrested, the White House said. She received a seven-year sentence despite having no prior record.\n\nThe third individual being pardoned on Tuesday is Dexter Jackson, a 52-year-old from Georgia who was convicted in 2002 for facilitating the distribution of marijuana through his business. Jackson was not directly involved in trafficking drugs, but allowed his business to be used for transactions. He pleaded guilty and served his sentence.\n\nIn addition to the three pardons, Biden is also commuting the sentences of 75 people who were charged with nonviolent drug crimes and are either serving prison time, under house arrest or are on supervised release.\n\nAll 75 “have made efforts to rehabilitate themselves, including through educational and vocational training or drug treatment in prison,” the White House said.\n\n“While today’s announcement marks important progress, my Administration will continue to\n\nreview clemency petitions and deliver reforms that advance equity and justice, provide second chances, and enhance the wellbeing and safety of all Americans,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nCriminal justice groups had urged Biden for months to use his clemency powers to provide relief for individuals serving lengthy sentences for nonviolent crimes, particularly as jails were overcrowded amid the coronavirus pandemic. Prior to Tuesday, Biden had not pardoned or commuted the sentence of anyone since taking office.\n\nIn addition to the clemency announcements, the White House detailed a multistep effort as part of Second Chance Month to reduce recidivism and make employment more accessible for those who have previously served time.\n\nThe departments of Justice and Labor are announcing a $145 million investment in job skills training and individual employment plans for inmates in Bureau of Prisons facilities.\n\nThe Small Business Administration will make changes to reduce barriers for those with criminal records to receive loans, and the Office of Personnel Management is adjusting its rules to make it easier for formerly incarcerated individuals to work in the federal government.\n\nThe Education Department will select dozens of schools to expand its Second Chance Pell Initiative, a program first established in 2015 that provides Pell Grants to incarcerated individuals so they can take college courses.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/BidenJoe_042122_AP-EvanVucci-1.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:17'}

She returned to Washington on Monday.\n\nHarris “will isolate and continue to work from the Vice President’s residence,” Kirsten Allen, her spokesperson, said in a statement. “The Vice President will return to the White House when she tests negative.”\n\nHarris had avoided catching the virus for months, despite close contacts testing positive. Jamal Simmons, her communications director, announced a positive result earlier this month; Harris’ husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, contracted the virus in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vice president’s positive tests could create governing concerns given that Harris is the first in line of presidential succession to Biden, 79. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:23'}

So, there you go. No, I’m just confirming that for you. It is true, as we’ve noted many times, it is possible the president could test positive. We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen,” Psaki said.\n\nShe added though that she thinks Biden would be able to continue his presidential duties if he were to test positive.\n\n“He has access to the best health care in the world, and we believe, because of all the precautions and steps we have taken that he would be able to continue his duties, as the vice president is as well as vice president,” she said.\n\nOfficials stress that he is vaccinated, and Psaki said last week last week that it wouldn’t be a failure of the precautions in place to protect Biden if he were to get the virus.\n\nPsaki on Tuesday told reporters not to expect updates to protocols, including masking protocols, within the White House in light of Harris’ positive test.\n\nShe noted there is a regular testing cadence for the president and vice president, as well as officials around them, and that there is social distancing in meetings and a number of aides choose to wear masks.\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/harriskamala_031522_ap_manuel_balce_ceneta.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:55'}

This time period covers when Biden was running his presidential campaign culminating in his 2020 victory, and his first year occupying the White House.\n\nThe largest category of banned posts related to Biden's reputation for inappropriate contact, CensorTrack said. Biden was forced to address this during his campaign.\n\nIn one example cited by the organization, a user told CensorTrack that Facebook deleted one of their posts that showed Biden kissing someone - reportedly his granddaughter - on the lips.\n\nA caption with the image said: 'Find someone who kisses you the way Joe Biden kisses his granddaughter.'

He wants Twitter's algorithm for prioritizing tweets to be public and objects to giving too much power on the service to corporations that advertise.\n\nPolitical activists expect that a Musk regime will mean less moderation and reinstatement of banned individuals including former President Donald Trump. Conservatives cheered the prospect of fewer controls while some human rights activists voiced fears of a rise in hate speech.\n\nMusk has also advocated user-friendly tweaks to the service, such as an edit button and defeating 'spam bots' that send overwhelming amounts of unwanted tweets.\n\n'Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,' Musk said in a statement.\n\nIn a tweet last Tuesday before the deal was announced, Musk wrote: 'A social media platform’s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy,' suggesting he would aim to limit extreme political views on the platform.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/10/57061635-0-image-a-4_1650966443612.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:36'}

Intelligence officials told Stefanik the question would be better answered by law enforcement.\n\nStefanik’s query, shared with The Associated Press by a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the classified meeting, reflects a widespread sentiment in the GOP that questions about the financial dealings of President Joe Biden’s son remain unanswered. And they say they intend to do something about it.\n\nAs Republicans prepare for a possible return to power amid rising hopes of winning the House and the Senate in the November elections, they are laying the groundwork to make Hunter Biden and his business dealings a central target of their investigative and oversight efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden’s memoir ‘Beautiful Things’ publishes in April\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staff have discussed analyzing specific messages and financial transactions found on the laptop and have also discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities involved in paying Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The conversations have been in the early stages but have included talks of bringing on Republican lawyers and former Justice Department officials to help lead the investigations, the people said.\n\nThe White House in turn is preparing to defend the Democratic president from any allegations of wrongdoing and make the case that Republicans are driven by opportunism. Democrats are likely to point out how Republicans did not seek investigations into President Donald Trump’s own business pursuits in Russia and China or into the foreign dealings of his children and son-in-law while they held key campaign or White House roles.\n\nIt all raises the possibility of a messy, politically explosive showdown between a GOP-controlled Congress and the White House, one that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nHunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”\n\nJoe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House declined to comment, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to an email.\n\nRepublican leaders see Hunter Biden as a unifying force that can bring together different factions of the GOP and potentially satiate those calling for more dramatic action. Some members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus have said the first order of business for a Republican majority should be an impeachment trial of Joe Biden in retaliation for the two impeachments of Trump.\n\nThere’s also increasing discussion among Republicans about urging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden says he’s facing federal investigation over ‘tax affairs’\n\n“Hunter Biden’s fair game because I believe Hunter Biden is a national security risk,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is in line to take over the House Oversight Committee if Republicans win the House. “Hopefully, when I get the gavel, we’ll take it a step further.”\n\nIn preparation, Comer’s oversight staff has already begun to make document requests and archived information related to the president’s son.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in October 2020 that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. The Kremlin had also interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee now want to probe the origins of a widely shared letter from 50 former intelligence officials released a week after the New York Post story. The letter claimed the laptop carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation” and suggested that “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”\n\nJoe Biden in the second presidential debate, responding to Trump’s reference to the “laptop from hell,” said “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant.” That statement went further than the letter, though it was immediately and widely reported as having labeled the laptop as disinformation. Trump and many Republicans accused Biden of invoking Russia to avoid scrutiny about his son.\n\nNo evidence has emerged since of any Russian connections to the laptop or the emails. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment of the 2020 election alleged that Russian leader Vladimir Putin authorized multiple efforts in support of Trump. Russian state media amplified “disparaging content” about Biden “including stories centered on his son,” the assessment said, which also alleges Putin had “purview” over the activities of a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, called allegations that the Russians were behind the laptop “absurd.” Stefanik in a statement said “any alleged attempt by the intelligence agencies or intelligence community leadership to portray the facts surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop as misinformation needs to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who in 2020 issued a report on Hunter Biden and his work on behalf of Ukraine gas company Burisma, recently made a presentation on the Senate floor laying out allegations they say the media have ignored but the Justice Department and Congress need to investigate.\n\n“The Biden administration has been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests,” Grassley said.\n\nFor now, the Biden administration and many top Democrats are not commenting publicly on Hunter Biden. But the White House has already reassigned communications staff to prepare to respond to GOP investigations of Hunter Biden and other likely targets, including the origins of the coronavirus and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDemocrats are expected to argue that Hunter Biden is ultimately a distraction to most voters concerned about domestic issues. The current House Oversight chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, previewed that argument in a statement responding to Comer, her Republican counterpart.\n\nSaid Maloney: “I’d hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be more focused on delivering for the American people than on phony outrage.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2022/04/2022-04-18T164916Z_950030436_RC2RPT9FSFOE_RTRMADP_3_RELIGION-EASTER-WHITE-HOUSE-1024x682.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:57'}

It deals with his foreign ties dating back to when his father was Obama's vice president.\n\nThe New York Post recently reported that one of Biden's son's top business partners, Eric Schwerin, met with Biden at the White House in 2010.\n\nSchwerin is the former president of Hunter Biden's investment firm Rosemont Seneca.\n\nHis visit with Biden was one of 19 total he paid to the White House, visitor logs uncovered by The Post reveal.\n\nThe president has on multiple occasions denied having anything to do with his son's business dealings.\n\nWhen asked about the report on Monday, Psaki said she had 'no information' on the matter.\n\nThe ongoing tax fraud investigation into Hunter Biden reportedly involves a laptop that was linked to him and contains numerous correspondences about his business.\n\nIt also may contain information that Biden did indeed profit off of his son's dealings.

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the administration, argued there was no way the government could detain so many asylum seekers for months or years. She cited a report that said there were 220,000 migrants apprehended at or near the border in March but only 32,000 beds in detention facilities.\n\n“No one disputes that the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] does not have sufficient detention capacity” to hold all those migrants, she said.\n\nThe government’s only reasonable option, she said, was to release most of them if they are judged likely to return when their asylum claim is due to be heard.\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh questioned whether that’s what Congress intended. Is there any hint “that anyone in Congress expected that if there was not sufficient detention capacity that hundreds of thousands of people would be paroled into the United States without being lawfully admitted?” he asked.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. agreed the administration’s position would permit unlimited number of migrants to be admitted and released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There aren’t enough beds in detention. So there is no limit, as you read the statute, to the number of people that you can release into the United States, right?” he told the solicitor general.\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration chose a different option and sent many of the Central American migrants back to the Mexican side of the border. Its officials did so believing the move would deter more migrants from traveling north.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argued that Trump’s policy was cruel and inhumane. They said it forced tens of thousands of people from Central America to live in squalid conditions subject to violence and abuse. Upon taking office, President Biden said he planned to repeal Trump’s policy.\n\nBut state lawyers for Texas and Missouri sued and last year won nationwide orders from judges that required the new administration to maintain the prior Trump policy. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order in the Texas case.\n\nIn August of last year, the justices by a 6-3 vote refused an emergency appeal seeking to overturn the judge’s orders. And there was no clear sign during Tuesday’s argument the majority will do so now.\n\nTraditionally, the court has given the executive branch broad authority to enforce the immigration laws, including reversing the policies of prior administrations.\n\nPrelogar said it would be a radical departure for the court to say the new administration must maintain the new policies put in place by the prior administration. Prior to 2019, no administration or member of Congress had asserted the immigration law required the government to detain every noncitizen who had a pending asylum claim, she said.\n\nBut lurking in the background is the long legal fight over DACA, the Obama-era policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

The public health order, which has been used by both the Biden and Trump administrations to expel a majority of migrants at the border due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will end on May 23.\n\nRepublicans and moderate Democrats have sounded the alarm about a massive surge in migration at the border on top of the already sky-high numbers that the administration has itself called "historic." DHS has been planning for up to 18,000 migrants a day and the current March numbers of 210,000 a month are expected to increase in the months ahead.\n\nDemocratic senators in particular have called for the Biden administration to have a plan in place before Title 42 is lifted and have introduced legislation in an attempt to make the administration implement such a plan. DHS has protested that it does, in fact, have a plan for the coming surge.\n\nThe six-step plan released by the administration involves the surging of resources, including medical support and transportation to the border, as well as initiatives to streamline the processing of migrants from the border to their release into the interior of the United States.\n\nHowever, the agency claims it is also administering consequences for unlawful entry, including the use of Expedited Removal (ER), which can allow for the rapid removal of recently arrived illegal immigrants. However, Border Patrol agents have told Fox News that if a migrant claims they have a fear of persecution, the removal order is changed to a Notice to Appear – meaning they are released into the United States with a future court date.\n\nThey said that migrants are already spreading the word about what to say to get released into the U.S. as the administration has already been increased its use of ER to remove illegal immigrants from Northern Triangle countries.\n\nA senior administration official, in a call with reporters, said there was no plan to use family detention as a way to help deal with the surge. However, the use of ER would allow for the use of detention for single adults. The administration has also stressed that it intends to remove "promptly" those who are allowed in, go through immigration proceedings, and are found not to have a valid asylum case.\n\nThe other pillars of the administration’s plan includes bolstering the capacity of non-governmental organizations to receive migrants after they’ve been processed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). NGOs often help migrants with travel, housing and other assistance after they are released.\n\nFinally, the administration say it will target and disrupt transnational criminal organizations who facilitate illegal immigration, and also deter illegal migration throughout the Hemisphere. It pointed to new migration agreements with Panama and Costa Rica, as well as "close cooperation with Mexico."\n\n"We are also sending a clear message in the region to counteract misinformation from smugglers, including that the termination of the Title 42 public health Order does not mean that the U.S. border is open," the memo says.\n\n58-MEMBER BIPARTISAN HOUSE PROBLEM SOLVERS CAUCUS BACKS BILL TO EXTEND TITLE 42\n\nMayorkas ends the memo by admitting that the migrant surge will "substantially strain" resources at the border, and instead calls on Congress to pass solutions to fix what the administration has claimed is a "broken" system.\n\n"Despite the efforts of our dedicated DHS workforce and our partners executing this comprehensive plan, a significant increase in migrant encounters will substantially strain our system even further," he says.\n\n"As it has since its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that holistically addresses the root causes of migration, strengthens border security, fixes our immigration system, and improves legal pathways," the memo says.\n\nThat legislation was quickly rejected by Republicans early last year due to its inclusion of a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants in the country, combined with a lack of border security measures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublican states have sued the Biden administration in a bid to stop the order being lifted on May 23. The states won a temporary restraining order on Monday as the case proceeds, although details of the order are not clear.\n\nThe 21 states are hoping to secure a preliminary injunction barring the lifting of the order after a hearing on May 13.', 'image': 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1358276236.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

On April 1, the CDC announced it was terminating it on May 23.\n\nU.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from the border town of Laredo, Texas, told Fox News Sunday that Biden was listening to immigration activists, not border communities or their representatives such as himself.\n\n“But my question is, who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue?” he asked, referring to Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol agents.\n\n“And more importantly, who’s listening to the border communities, the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people that live on the border?” he asked.\n\nCuellar is facing a tough runoff election May 24 and, if he wins, a tough general election in November.\n\n“How can we have the federal public emergency extended to July 15 and say there’s a pandemic going on in the United States, but at the border, everything’s fine, and just let people into the United States,” he said, adding, “Those are mixed messages.”\n\nHe also addressed the administration’s mixed messages when it comes to mandates. “How can you ask for international travelers to make sure … they’re vaccinated or even show their COVID-19 negative tests if they fly in?” Cueller asked, referring to vaccine mandates imposed on legal travelers when no such requirements exist for those who’ve entered the U.S. illegally and are then released into the U.S. by the Biden administration.\n\nCuellar also posted pictures of existing overcrowded holding facilities at the border with Title 42 in place.\n\n“Title 42 is critical to ensuring the health and safety of migrants, law enforcement, and border residents,” he said.\n\nDemocratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak wrote Biden late last week expressing concerns about Title 42 ending. He asked him “to reconsider any intentions of undoing Title 42 until there is a comprehensive plan for how the United States can avoid the humanitarian crisis this policy change would spark.”\n\nThe CDC issued a statement on April 1 announcing it was ending Title 42 due to “an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics)” and said, “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.”\n\nInstead, the Department of Homeland Security was implementing “appropriate COVID-19 mitigation protocols, such as scaling up a program to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to migrants and prepare for resumption of regular migration under Title 8,” the CDC said.\n\nBut on April 12, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra announced he was renewing the national public health emergency order “as a result of the continued consequences of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.” He said the public health emergency “exists and has existed since January 27, 2020, nationwide,” and was renewed by the Trump and Biden administrations eight times.\n\nSet to expire April 15, it was renewed effective April 16 for an additional 90 days.\n\nArizona Democratic U.S. Sen. Krysten Sinema argues extending the public health emergency “proves the need to delay lifting Title 42 to protect the health and safety of Arizona communities and migrants.” In a statement, she said she would “keep pushing for transparency and accountability from the administration to help secure the border, keep Arizona communities safe, and ensure migrants are treated fairly and humanely.”\n\nEarlier this month, she joined a bipartisan effort to prevent Title 42’s end until after the national public health emergency order ends. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., the lead Democratic cosponsor, filed the Public Health and Border Security Act of 2022. Joining him as Democratic cosponsors were Sinema and Sens. Joe Manchin from West Virginia, Jon Tester from Montana, and Maggie Hassan from New Hampshire.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jared Goldman, D-Maine, was the lead Democratic cosponsor of the companion bill in the House. Joining him were Democratic cosponsors, Reps. Tom O’Halleran and Greg Stanton of Arizona, Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and Tim Ryan of Ohio.\n\nThe bill isn’t likely to pass the House even if it were to pass the Senate.\n\nSo far, 22 states have sued to stop the administration from halting Title 42 in two separate lawsuits. Unless the Biden administration is stopped by the courts, DHS announced last month measures it was putting in place to prepare for up to 18,000 people a day expected to enter U.S. custody once Title 42 is lifted.\n\nThis estimate is in addition to the roughly 2 million people who were apprehended or encountered by Border Patrol agents in Biden’s first year in office while Title 42 was in place. All encounter numbers exclude “gotaways,” those who evade capture and don’t surrender at ports of entry.\n\nRepublished with the permission of The Center Square.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...', 'image': 'https://altoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Henry-cuellar-696x464.webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:27'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

Klain said: "Of course the president\'s confident that his son didn\'t break the law."\n\nAlso, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged a media question Monday, inquiring about a New York Post report of a Hunter Biden business associate (Eric Schwerin, the former president of Hunter Biden\'s investment firm Rosemont Seneca) visiting the White House 19 separate times from 2009-13.\n\nThe potential relevance here: President Biden has previously stated he has "never spoken" to Hunter Biden, or any of his financial partners, about outside business deals.\n\nLater in the Senate hearing, Hagerty asked Garland whether Americans "can be confident that this administration is conducting a serious investigation."\n\nGarland answered in the affirmative, adding, "Because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters."\n\nEmails from Hunter Biden\'s laptop reportedly indicate Schwerin had access to Joe Biden\'s personal finances, including being involved with the elder Biden\'s taxes and discussing the then-vice president\'s financial future with him.\n\nIn 2019, the FBI seized control of a Hunter Biden laptop left in a Delaware-based repair shop. The contents of the laptop have yet to be released to the public, in full; but last month, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., successfully included the hard-drive components of Hunter Biden\'s captured laptop into the Congressional Record.\n\nThe current Hunter Biden probe has since been expanded to possible acts of money laundering and the violation of lobbying laws, according to reports. Last week, the Washington Post confirmed that in 2017 and 2018, Hunter Biden and the president\'s brother, James Biden, controlled $4.8 million in payments from a Chinese energy conglomerate.\n\nEarlier in April, a witness in the Hunter Biden grand jury proceedings was asked about Biden\'s deal with CEFC China Energy Co., along with the identity of "the big guy" during sworn testimony in Wilmington, Delaware, according to a New York Post report.\n\nCiting the Post report, a source familiar with the grand jury\'s work says the question had been posed after the witness was shown a piece of evidence, which included the cryptic query of "10 held by H for the big guy."\n\nThe line of grand-jury questioning follows up a separate New York Post report from October 2020, when James Gilliar, a former business partner to Hunter Biden, outlined the proposed percentage distribution of equity in a company that was created as a joint venture with CEFC China Energy Co.\n\nAt his 2020 impeachment trial, then-President Donald Trump\'s defense team cited Obama-era visitor logs that indicated Biden met with his son\'s business partner Devon Archer, April 16, 2014 — around the time Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he reportedly earned $1 million per year.\n\nAt the time, then-Vice President Joe Biden led U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\nCiting the New York Post report, documents and a photo indicated that Joe Biden attended a 2015 Washington, D.C., dinner with a group of his son\'s associates — including Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi and the Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.\n\nA Senate report from 2020 uncovered that, in 2014, Baturina paid $3.5 million to a firm linked to Hunter Biden.', 'image': 'https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=371c9975-705f-4593-a515-3d893c7330c3&SiteName=Newsmax', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:09'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

If they don\'t know whom to ask, the challenge is even greater. But an even worse error is to decide on an answer before even asking the question — and then refusing to hear any answers that don\'t confirm what they\'ve already decided.\n\nAmerica\'s political class, especially the pundits and commentators, are guilty of all of these errors (and many more) as they continue to willfully not understand the Age of Trump and how America arrived at this democracy crisis. The Republican-fascist movement is winning because so many people who are supposed to know better continue to view simple questions as puzzling and mysterious, and continue to ignore the obvious answers.\n\nMany such voices among the high priesthood of the church of the savvy and the other professional smart people have concluded that the Republican Party is in the midst of a "civil war" or is in "disarray" in the aftermath of Donald Trump\'s presidency. That\'s not true: The Republican Party is "evolving" just as other fascist and authoritarian movements have historically done, largely by purging those who disagree with the Great Leader and his vision.\n\nRELATED: Here\'s why Trump won\'t run in 2024 — and why the Trump cult ultimately can\'t win\n\nMany of the same voices also announce that Trump\'s hold on the Republican-fascist Party and movement is weakening because of diminished attendance at his rallies, or because of rumors and "revelations" about internal resistance surrounding Trump\'s coup plot of Jan. 6, 2021. Those are significant details and facts, but they do not override the basic reality that Trump continues to be the leader of the Republican Party and the larger neofascist movement. He received millions more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016, and until he decides otherwise he is the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nRepublican voters and right-leaning independents continue to view Trump and what he represents as the identity and brand name of today\'s Republican Party and "conservative" movement. Moreover, the 2024 election is more than two years away and traditional barometers of Trump\'s popularity cannot be seen as reliably predictive.\n\nMaybe the media\'s worst misreading is the claim that Trump led the Republican Party astray. In fact, he set it free — to follow its worst impulses.\n\nBut those questions pale compared to the grandest misreading of all: the claim that Trump and Trumpism led the Republican Party astray from its core values, and by doing so "sabotaged" it. Reality is quite different: Trump and his neofascist right-wing populist movement set modern-day Republican leaders and voters free to embrace their antisocial, anti-human, anti-democratic, reactionary, racist, sexist, plutocratic, theocratic, conspiracist, anti-intellectual and anti-rational values and beliefs. Trumpism was not suddenly born ex nihilo in 2015; it has been at least 30 years in the making.\n\nUltimately, what America\'s political class, the punditry and most of the mainstream news media refuse to understand is that Donald Trump is simultaneously a man, a symbol, and a cult-leader who embodies a form of freedom — specifically, the freedom to indulge in the worst aspects of human behavior and then to wallow in the chaos and pain and suffering that result. Like other forms of fascism, Trumpism is exhilarating for followers and believers; it gives their lives purpose, meaning and a sense of community, largely by inflicting pain for those designated as its enemies.\n\nIn a recent column at Salon, longtime White House reporter Brian Karem summarizes Trump\'s hold over his followers and their devotion to him:\n\nTrump has played it close to the vest as he has traveled across the country to a variety of rallies, pitching baubles and trinkets to dazzle and amaze those of simple minds and limited funds. Buy a hat. Buy a shirt. Buy an ornament. Buy an autographed picture. Buy anything Trump is selling — probably up to and including autographed underwear. Millions continue to support him by buying his cheap and tawdry knickknacks. It makes me wonder what these homes look like. "Come in. clean your feet on the Trump doormat, hang up your coat on the Trump coat rack. Have a seat and a complimentary beverage out of our Trump lemonade pitcher, poured lovingly into a Trump autographed mug." Meanwhile, you can take a look at a phone video shot by Donald Trump Jr. inviting you to visit a "top secret" rally with his father — and, gosh, even get a chance to meet Dad! What the hell is a top secret rally? Isn\'t that what the KKK used to do?\n\nThe following observation is no doubt a challenging concept for those still wedded to "normal politics" and other obsolescent ways of thinking: "Donald Trump" is of immense symbolic importance, but Donald Trump the human being barely even matters. As I detailed in an earlier essay for Salon, "Donald Trump is no longer a mere person. Indeed, to some extent the human being behind the Trump persona has become irrelevant." In other words, Trump is integral to the American neofascist project — but he is also disposable and can be replaced as the situation demands.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nIf the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. For too many people in America\'s political class and the news media, especially, the only lens available to interpret politics is through horserace-style coverage, centrism bias, outmoded notions of balance and fairness, questions about who has "coattails" and is piling up "endorsements," and of course the results of public opinion polls and focus groups. To acknowledge that these habits and tools no longer have the explanatory power they once did (not very long ago) would be an enormous psychological leap, approaching epistemic collapse.\n\nHere are three examples of how strongly Donald Trump\'s power endures, whatever the hope-peddlers, professional centrists and others among the commentariat would like us to believe:\n\n1. The Republican Party announced last week that it will no longer participate in the 2024 presidential debates hosted by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nDebates serve an important function in a democracy and as such have played a key role in many elections. They are especially important for helping low information, independent and relatively apolitical voters decide whom to support. Beyond that, participation in a debate signals a commitment to democratic norms and institutions. Debates also reaffirm a shared belief in the principle that truth exists outside of partisanship and ideology.\n\nFascists and other authoritarians reject such consensus values. By rejecting the presidential debates, and replacing them with some type of right-wing propaganda theater, the Republican Party is choosing to protect Donald Trump (or his successors) from public scrutiny. Paul Waldman of the Washington Post offered this context:\n\nThe Republican Party has just offered us a glimpse of the hell they\'re going to put us all through in 2024. What might appear to be a petty argument about the conditions under which general election debates will or won\'t be held is actually much more…. But it\'s also a sign that the Republican strategy will again feature chaotic, Trumpian whining that is meant to delegitimize the entire presidential campaign process from start to finish, culminating in an attempt to take back the White House by theft if the voters don\'t vote the "right" way. Let\'s remember that while Trump performed well in the 2016 primary debates when he was on stage with a collection of empty suits, he did poorly in every one of his debates with Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. By the fall of 2024, he\'ll be 78 years old; the idea that he\'ll be more disciplined and focused than he was in the past is far-fetched. Everything Americans dislike about him would be on vivid display in a debate, before the largest audience the candidates will have. If Republicans announce now, two-and-a-half years in advance, that they\'re refusing to participate in the debates, it could save them a last-minute act of cowardice. But the more important reason they\'re doing this is to reinforce the idea that every institution and practice associated with the presidential campaign must be considered corrupt and biased against Trump and therefore illegitimate, whether it\'s the news media, the debates, maybe even the weather — and especially the vote counting.\n\n2. Republicans are enthusiastically doing the bidding of Donald Trump and his fascist project.\n\nWe see this through growing support for the Jan. 6 coup attempt and the Capitol attack, the escalating assault on democracy and voting rights, the moral panic around "critical race theory"; anti-LGBTQ bigotry and related conspiracy theories, the campaign to roll back reproductive rights and freedoms, the assault on free speech and other fundamental civil and human rights, the war on reason and critical thinking, the Big Lie, and the support (covert or otherwise) for right-wing authoritarians such as Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán.\n\nThe embrace of racism and the attack on reproductive rights and LGBTQ equality are not "top-down" politics. Republican voters overwhelmingly embrace those views.\n\nThis is not a story of "top-down" politics, or elites otherwise imposing their values on a public. Republican voters overwhelmingly support these policies and the values they embody. Donald Trump is a gifted political entrepreneur; he understood that many tens of millions of Americans yearn for fascism or some other form of authoritarian rule.\n\n3. To this point, Republican leaders and candidates are still in thrall to Trump. They must prostrate themselves before him and seek his blessing as a pathway to power.\n\nIn a recent article for the New York Times, Shane Goldmacher details how Trump continues to rule the Republican Party and the larger neofascist movement from his Mar-a-Lago retreat:\n\nFor 15 months, a parade of supplicants — senators, governors, congressional leaders and Republican strivers of all stripes — have made the trek to pledge their loyalty and pitch their candidacies. Some have hired Mr. Trump\'s advisers, hoping to gain an edge in seeking his endorsement. Some have bought ads that ran only on Fox News in South Florida. Some bear gifts; others dish dirt. Almost everyone parrots his lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Working from a large wooden desk reminiscent of the one he used in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has transformed Mar-a-Lago\'s old bridal suite into a shadow G.O.P. headquarters, amassing more than $120 million — a war chest more than double that of the Republican National Committee itself. ... And while other past presidents have ceded the political stage, Mr. Trump has done the opposite, aggressively pursuing an agenda of vengeance against Republicans who have wronged him, endorsing more than 140 candidates nationwide and turning the 2022 primaries into a stress test of his continued sway. ... "Party leaders have never played the role that Trump is playing," said Roger Stone, an on-and-off adviser to Mr. Trump since the 1980s who has been spotted at Mar-a-Lago of late. "Because he can — and he\'s not bound by the conventional rules of politics."\n\nGoldmacher raises the question of whether Trump\'s "big public profile" will be "a potent turnoff for swing voters" in the fall election, which remains to be seen. But in Republican primaries, "few serious candidates are openly breaking" with him. Former Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn says Trump\'s conquest of the party "has been so complete ... that even the RINOs are attempting to talk MAGA."\n\n"Few see an expiration date" on Trump\'s dominance of the Republican Party, Goldmacher concludes, "until and unless he declines to run again in 2024 or is defeated." GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has reportedly told Trump, "We need you."\n\nIs that a portrait of a fascist leader whose power is in decline? With a war chest estimated at $120 million and a right-wing disinformation media machine largely at his command, at this moment Donald Trump is the Republican Party. The fact that some members of the political and media classes read Goldmacher\'s story as announcing the end of the Trump era only reflects the biased and distorted view of reality that led America to this ugly situation in the first place.\n\nAccording to traditional Christian theology, the devil\'s greatest trick was to convince the people of the world that he does not exist.

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:48'}

Schwerin met with John McGrail, who was a counselor to Biden, on July 15 and Sept. 9 at the White House. He also met with Kaitlyn Demers, who was serving as an associate counsel in Biden\'s office in 2016, on June 28.

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,” McCarthy said. “And then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_mayorkasalejandro_042522gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:22'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit.

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge’s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called “this enormous threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac166314b8679c166f4e126f34de9b87e912373/0_296_5889_3533/master/5889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4c7c29ca50ead9e29c1693f5d2a70d2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

And the Biden administration predicts roughly 12,000 migrants per day will begin crossing the border when Title 42 is lifted. Currently, about half of those migrants encountered are turned back across the border and prevented from seeking asylum. When Title 42 is lifted, immigrants will be allowed to live in the United States while they pursue asylum claims, a process that can take between two to four years.\n\nThe Biden administration says it plans to deport more migrants who do not pass the initial screening for asylum and is working with countries in the region to accept flights returning their citizens.\n\nOne country that has refused to accept back its emigrants is Cuba. Another senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday that talks between the U.S. and Cuba over immigration policy are “ongoing” and off to a “good start.”\n\nFamilies from El Salvador, Guatemala and El Salvador made up the majority of border crossers prior to the pandemic.

Officials said asylum-seekers fleeing violence will have access to humanitarian protection.\n\nThe updated Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans could alleviate concerns from some Democrats who have implored the administration to develop an adequate border management strategy before ending Title 42, but the preparations could be hindered by a federal court order.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to issue a temporary restraining order blocking officials from winding down Title 42 before May 23.

Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters about the plan on the condition they not be named, confirmed Tuesday that the U.S. government "will comply with the court order," but added, "we really disagree with the basic premise."\n\n"When the Title 42 order is lifted, we intend to significantly expand the use of expedited removal through our Title 8 authorities and thereby impose long-term law enforcement consequences on those who seek to cross the border without a lawful basis to do so," the official added.\n\nThe official said it "really makes no sense to us" that the court would order DHS to halt expedited removal, arguing that a pause on phasing out Title 42 will prevent the department from "adequately preparing for the aggressive application of immigration law when the public health order expires."\n\nThe administration official said expedited removal would be used to deport some Central Americans back to their home countries, as opposed to expelling them to Mexico under Title 42, which could allow them to attempt to enter the U.S. illegally multiple times.\n\nThe official said U.S. border authorities have started deporting repeat border-crossers under expedited removal, which banishes them from the U.S. for five years, and referring migrants who seek to evade capture to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.\n\nTuesday\'s plan also calls for the detention of migrant adults traveling without children "when appropriate." Administration officials have ruled out detaining migrant families with children, telling reporters Tuesday the practice started under President Barack Obama and expanded under President Donald Trump "is not a tool we are considering now."\n\nThe planned expansion of expedited removal could be restricted by some countries\' refusal to accept U.S. deportations. An administration official said the U.S. is hoping to forge new repatriation collaboration agreements with certain countries that would cut red tape for carrying out deportations.\n\nU.S. officials have historically struggled to return large numbers of migrants to certain countries like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela due to strained relations with their respective governments. In March, a record 32,000 Cubans and 16,000 Nicaraguans entered U.S. border custody, according to CBP data.\n\nAdministration officials characterized last week\'s diplomatic summit with Cuba as "productive," and "the beginning of a good dialogue." The U.S. delegation requested that Cuba once again accept Cuban deportees, while the U.S. agreed to restart immigrant visa processing in Havana, officials said.\n\nThe Biden administration is also asking countries that migrants transit through to help the U.S. reduce the number of arrivals to the Mexican border.\n\n"We\'re also asking that other countries step up and enforce their own immigration laws," one senior administration official said. "We really feel as though we need true responsibility sharing. We can\'t have countries, for instance, participating in controlled flow, where they\'re just allowing individuals to cross through without normal adjudication."\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas during a tour of the Panama Canal at the Miraflores Locks, in Panama City, Panama, on April 19, 2022.

"It\'s quite challenging in dealing with a country like Venezuela, where the diplomatic relations, if they exist at all, can be strained," Mayorkas told CBS News last week. "And so we have to be practical here in addressing the realities."\n\nFor its part, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has currently stationed 23,000 agents along the southwest border, according to Tuesday\'s memo, including 600 recently deployed personnel and law enforcement officers from across government agencies.\n\n"By May 23, we will be prepared to hold approximately 18,000 noncitizens in CBP custody at any given time, up from 13,000 at the beginning of 2021, and we have doubled our ability to transport noncitizens on a daily basis, with flexibility to increase further," the memo reads.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers Tuesday that both the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service will contribute resources to the border mission.\n\n"To be clear, we don\'t do border patrolling," Garland said, noting law enforcement under the purview of the Department of Justice is not trained for immigration enforcement. "But the Bureau of Prisons is going to make buses available for the transfers that Border Patrol needs assistance for. And the Marshall Service is going to be providing additional deputy U.S. Marshals to assist CBP at the border."\n\nThe Defense Department, meanwhile, will provide "rapid contracting support for air and ground transportation," according to a senior administration official, in addition to identifying potential locations for new temporary migrant holding facilities along the southwest border.\n\nOfficials also noted the Department of National Intelligence is "coordinating intelligence gathering and helping to support and strengthen our capability to get an early warning of migrant surges as they are building."\n\nDHS plans to expand the distribution of "age-appropriate" COVID-19 vaccines to migrants at two dozen CBP sites by May 23, in addition to its existing vaccination program for those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.\n\nOfficials also confirmed that MaryAnn Tierney, the regional administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will soon transition out of her short-lived role, where she led the newly established "Southwest Border Coordination Center." The center was established in February, and Mayorkas appointed Tierney shortly thereafter. Officials have yet to formally announce Tierney\'s replacement.\n\nTuesday\'s memo acknowledged "historic levels of migration" to the U.S. border. Apprehensions of migrants along the southern border soared to 221,000 last month, a 22-year high.

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:55'}

Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number.\n\nAlready the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House.\n\nMonths ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug Paxlovid against COVID.=-19 from the manufacturer Pfizer is lying on a table. Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.”\n\nNow, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nJapan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill.\n\n“We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.”\n\nComplicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.\n\nLast month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.\n\nAdministration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.\n\nThe funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.\n\nModerna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses.\n\nEarlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.\n\nRepublicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.\n\nThere are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage.\n\nSuch a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.\n\nRepublicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.\n\nIt would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.\n\n___', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6267ba122300002bf413a7d4.jpeg?cache=WRFAs9cO4t&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

She received a seven-year sentence despite having no prior record.\n\nThe third individual being pardoned on Tuesday is Dexter Jackson, a 52-year-old from Georgia who was convicted in 2002 for facilitating the distribution of marijuana through his business. Jackson was not directly involved in trafficking drugs, but allowed his business to be used for transactions. He pleaded guilty and served his sentence.\n\nIn addition to the three pardons, Biden is also commuting the sentences of 75 people who were charged with nonviolent drug crimes and are either serving prison time, under house arrest or are on supervised release.\n\nAll 75 “have made efforts to rehabilitate themselves, including through educational and vocational training or drug treatment in prison,” the White House said.\n\n“While today’s announcement marks important progress, my Administration will continue to\n\nreview clemency petitions and deliver reforms that advance equity and justice, provide second chances, and enhance the wellbeing and safety of all Americans,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nCriminal justice groups had urged Biden for months to use his clemency powers to provide relief for individuals serving lengthy sentences for nonviolent crimes, particularly as jails were overcrowded amid the coronavirus pandemic. Prior to Tuesday, Biden had not pardoned or commuted the sentence of anyone since taking office.\n\nIn addition to the clemency announcements, the White House detailed a multistep effort as part of Second Chance Month to reduce recidivism and make employment more accessible for those who have previously served time.\n\nThe departments of Justice and Labor are announcing a $145 million investment in job skills training and individual employment plans for inmates in Bureau of Prisons facilities.\n\nThe Small Business Administration will make changes to reduce barriers for those with criminal records to receive loans, and the Office of Personnel Management is adjusting its rules to make it easier for formerly incarcerated individuals to work in the federal government.\n\nThe Education Department will select dozens of schools to expand its Second Chance Pell Initiative, a program first established in 2015 that provides Pell Grants to incarcerated individuals so they can take college courses.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/BidenJoe_042122_AP-EvanVucci-1.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:17'}

She returned to Washington on Monday.\n\nHarris “will isolate and continue to work from the Vice President’s residence,” Kirsten Allen, her spokesperson, said in a statement. “The Vice President will return to the White House when she tests negative.”\n\nHarris had avoided catching the virus for months, despite close contacts testing positive. Jamal Simmons, her communications director, announced a positive result earlier this month; Harris’ husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, contracted the virus in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vice president’s positive tests could create governing concerns given that Harris is the first in line of presidential succession to Biden, 79. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:23'}

So, there you go. No, I’m just confirming that for you. It is true, as we’ve noted many times, it is possible the president could test positive. We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen,” Psaki said.\n\nShe added though that she thinks Biden would be able to continue his presidential duties if he were to test positive.\n\n“He has access to the best health care in the world, and we believe, because of all the precautions and steps we have taken that he would be able to continue his duties, as the vice president is as well as vice president,” she said.\n\nOfficials stress that he is vaccinated, and Psaki said last week last week that it wouldn’t be a failure of the precautions in place to protect Biden if he were to get the virus.\n\nPsaki on Tuesday told reporters not to expect updates to protocols, including masking protocols, within the White House in light of Harris’ positive test.\n\nShe noted there is a regular testing cadence for the president and vice president, as well as officials around them, and that there is social distancing in meetings and a number of aides choose to wear masks.\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/harriskamala_031522_ap_manuel_balce_ceneta.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:55'}

The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP.

She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House.

He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

And press secretary Jen Psaki is expected to depart in the weeks ahead, a move that may include several members of the White House press team as well, multiple administration sources say.\n\nIt is fairly standard for top White House officials to warn staff long before midterm and presidential elections that they should depart with plenty of lead time, or stay until the election is over. But it is unclear whether Biden\'s chief of staff Ron Klain has issued such a memo.\n\nMany political analysts believe Republicans are poised to take control of the House and possibly the Senate as well this November, as voters weigh in on inflation that has soared to a 40-year high on Biden\'s watch, and progressive groups disappointed in Biden\'s progress on climate and social issues stay home from the polls.\n\nRichmond will leave for a "new important role" at some point in the future, Psaki told reporters Monday, adding it was "something the president is excited about and has asked him to do." His departure was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nPsaki\'s primary deputy press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, is considered a top contender to take over when Psaki leaves, multiple sources within the White House said.\n\nOn a West Coast swing last week, Biden predicted Democrats could win two more U.S. Senate seats in November\'s midterms, strengthening the party\'s majority to pass his agenda despite sagging approval ratings.

Intelligence officials told Stefanik the question would be better answered by law enforcement.\n\nStefanik’s query, shared with The Associated Press by a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the classified meeting, reflects a widespread sentiment in the GOP that questions about the financial dealings of President Joe Biden’s son remain unanswered. And they say they intend to do something about it.\n\nAs Republicans prepare for a possible return to power amid rising hopes of winning the House and the Senate in the November elections, they are laying the groundwork to make Hunter Biden and his business dealings a central target of their investigative and oversight efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden’s memoir ‘Beautiful Things’ publishes in April\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staff have discussed analyzing specific messages and financial transactions found on the laptop and have also discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities involved in paying Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The conversations have been in the early stages but have included talks of bringing on Republican lawyers and former Justice Department officials to help lead the investigations, the people said.\n\nThe White House in turn is preparing to defend the Democratic president from any allegations of wrongdoing and make the case that Republicans are driven by opportunism. Democrats are likely to point out how Republicans did not seek investigations into President Donald Trump’s own business pursuits in Russia and China or into the foreign dealings of his children and son-in-law while they held key campaign or White House roles.\n\nIt all raises the possibility of a messy, politically explosive showdown between a GOP-controlled Congress and the White House, one that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nHunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”\n\nJoe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House declined to comment, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to an email.\n\nRepublican leaders see Hunter Biden as a unifying force that can bring together different factions of the GOP and potentially satiate those calling for more dramatic action. Some members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus have said the first order of business for a Republican majority should be an impeachment trial of Joe Biden in retaliation for the two impeachments of Trump.\n\nThere’s also increasing discussion among Republicans about urging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden says he’s facing federal investigation over ‘tax affairs’\n\n“Hunter Biden’s fair game because I believe Hunter Biden is a national security risk,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is in line to take over the House Oversight Committee if Republicans win the House. “Hopefully, when I get the gavel, we’ll take it a step further.”\n\nIn preparation, Comer’s oversight staff has already begun to make document requests and archived information related to the president’s son.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in October 2020 that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. The Kremlin had also interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee now want to probe the origins of a widely shared letter from 50 former intelligence officials released a week after the New York Post story. The letter claimed the laptop carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation” and suggested that “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”\n\nJoe Biden in the second presidential debate, responding to Trump’s reference to the “laptop from hell,” said “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant.” That statement went further than the letter, though it was immediately and widely reported as having labeled the laptop as disinformation. Trump and many Republicans accused Biden of invoking Russia to avoid scrutiny about his son.\n\nNo evidence has emerged since of any Russian connections to the laptop or the emails. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment of the 2020 election alleged that Russian leader Vladimir Putin authorized multiple efforts in support of Trump. Russian state media amplified “disparaging content” about Biden “including stories centered on his son,” the assessment said, which also alleges Putin had “purview” over the activities of a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, called allegations that the Russians were behind the laptop “absurd.” Stefanik in a statement said “any alleged attempt by the intelligence agencies or intelligence community leadership to portray the facts surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop as misinformation needs to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who in 2020 issued a report on Hunter Biden and his work on behalf of Ukraine gas company Burisma, recently made a presentation on the Senate floor laying out allegations they say the media have ignored but the Justice Department and Congress need to investigate.\n\n“The Biden administration has been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests,” Grassley said.\n\nFor now, the Biden administration and many top Democrats are not commenting publicly on Hunter Biden. But the White House has already reassigned communications staff to prepare to respond to GOP investigations of Hunter Biden and other likely targets, including the origins of the coronavirus and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDemocrats are expected to argue that Hunter Biden is ultimately a distraction to most voters concerned about domestic issues.

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the administration, argued there was no way the government could detain so many asylum seekers for months or years. She cited a report that said there were 220,000 migrants apprehended at or near the border in March but only 32,000 beds in detention facilities.\n\n“No one disputes that the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] does not have sufficient detention capacity” to hold all those migrants, she said.\n\nThe government’s only reasonable option, she said, was to release most of them if they are judged likely to return when their asylum claim is due to be heard.\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh questioned whether that’s what Congress intended. Is there any hint “that anyone in Congress expected that if there was not sufficient detention capacity that hundreds of thousands of people would be paroled into the United States without being lawfully admitted?” he asked.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. agreed the administration’s position would permit unlimited number of migrants to be admitted and released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There aren’t enough beds in detention. So there is no limit, as you read the statute, to the number of people that you can release into the United States, right?” he told the solicitor general.\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration chose a different option and sent many of the Central American migrants back to the Mexican side of the border. Its officials did so believing the move would deter more migrants from traveling north.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argued that Trump’s policy was cruel and inhumane. They said it forced tens of thousands of people from Central America to live in squalid conditions subject to violence and abuse. Upon taking office, President Biden said he planned to repeal Trump’s policy.\n\nBut state lawyers for Texas and Missouri sued and last year won nationwide orders from judges that required the new administration to maintain the prior Trump policy. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order in the Texas case.\n\nIn August of last year, the justices by a 6-3 vote refused an emergency appeal seeking to overturn the judge’s orders. And there was no clear sign during Tuesday’s argument the majority will do so now.\n\nTraditionally, the court has given the executive branch broad authority to enforce the immigration laws, including reversing the policies of prior administrations.\n\nPrelogar said it would be a radical departure for the court to say the new administration must maintain the new policies put in place by the prior administration. Prior to 2019, no administration or member of Congress had asserted the immigration law required the government to detain every noncitizen who had a pending asylum claim, she said.\n\nBut lurking in the background is the long legal fight over DACA, the Obama-era policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. President Obama used his authority under the immigration laws to suspend enforcement against young people who were brought illegally to this country when they were children.\n\nTrump moved to repeal that policy, but judges in California and New York put the repeal on hold. Lawyers for Trump argued the new president had ample authority to revoke a discretionary enforcement policy adopted by Obama.\n\nTwo years ago, however, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote ruled against Trump and blocked the repeal.\n\nNow in the case of Biden vs. Texas, the justices will rule on whether the new administration is free to repeal Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy.\n\nA decision can be expected by late June.', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f7a67b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2Fde%2Fa50bba424e1eb301ca3265187af2%2F914957-na-pol-0210-supreme-court-kkn-11150.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:48'}

The public health order, which has been used by both the Biden and Trump administrations to expel a majority of migrants at the border due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will end on May 23.\n\nRepublicans and moderate Democrats have sounded the alarm about a massive surge in migration at the border on top of the already sky-high numbers that the administration has itself called "historic." DHS has been planning for up to 18,000 migrants a day and the current March numbers of 210,000 a month are expected to increase in the months ahead.\n\nDemocratic senators in particular have called for the Biden administration to have a plan in place before Title 42 is lifted and have introduced legislation in an attempt to make the administration implement such a plan. DHS has protested that it does, in fact, have a plan for the coming surge.\n\nThe six-step plan released by the administration involves the surging of resources, including medical support and transportation to the border, as well as initiatives to streamline the processing of migrants from the border to their release into the interior of the United States.\n\nHowever, the agency claims it is also administering consequences for unlawful entry, including the use of Expedited Removal (ER), which can allow for the rapid removal of recently arrived illegal immigrants. However, Border Patrol agents have told Fox News that if a migrant claims they have a fear of persecution, the removal order is changed to a Notice to Appear – meaning they are released into the United States with a future court date.\n\nThey said that migrants are already spreading the word about what to say to get released into the U.S. as the administration has already been increased its use of ER to remove illegal immigrants from Northern Triangle countries.\n\nA senior administration official, in a call with reporters, said there was no plan to use family detention as a way to help deal with the surge. However, the use of ER would allow for the use of detention for single adults. The administration has also stressed that it intends to remove "promptly" those who are allowed in, go through immigration proceedings, and are found not to have a valid asylum case.\n\nThe other pillars of the administration’s plan includes bolstering the capacity of non-governmental organizations to receive migrants after they’ve been processed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). NGOs often help migrants with travel, housing and other assistance after they are released.\n\nFinally, the administration say it will target and disrupt transnational criminal organizations who facilitate illegal immigration, and also deter illegal migration throughout the Hemisphere. It pointed to new migration agreements with Panama and Costa Rica, as well as "close cooperation with Mexico."\n\n"We are also sending a clear message in the region to counteract misinformation from smugglers, including that the termination of the Title 42 public health Order does not mean that the U.S. border is open," the memo says.\n\n58-MEMBER BIPARTISAN HOUSE PROBLEM SOLVERS CAUCUS BACKS BILL TO EXTEND TITLE 42\n\nMayorkas ends the memo by admitting that the migrant surge will "substantially strain" resources at the border, and instead calls on Congress to pass solutions to fix what the administration has claimed is a "broken" system.\n\n"Despite the efforts of our dedicated DHS workforce and our partners executing this comprehensive plan, a significant increase in migrant encounters will substantially strain our system even further," he says.\n\n"As it has since its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that holistically addresses the root causes of migration, strengthens border security, fixes our immigration system, and improves legal pathways," the memo says.\n\nThat legislation was quickly rejected by Republicans early last year due to its inclusion of a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants in the country, combined with a lack of border security measures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublican states have sued the Biden administration in a bid to stop the order being lifted on May 23.

He asked him “to reconsider any intentions of undoing Title 42 until there is a comprehensive plan for how the United States can avoid the humanitarian crisis this policy change would spark.”\n\nThe CDC issued a statement on April 1 announcing it was ending Title 42 due to “an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics)” and said, “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.”\n\nInstead, the Department of Homeland Security was implementing “appropriate COVID-19 mitigation protocols, such as scaling up a program to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to migrants and prepare for resumption of regular migration under Title 8,” the CDC said.\n\nBut on April 12, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra announced he was renewing the national public health emergency order “as a result of the continued consequences of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.” He said the public health emergency “exists and has existed since January 27, 2020, nationwide,” and was renewed by the Trump and Biden administrations eight times.\n\nSet to expire April 15, it was renewed effective April 16 for an additional 90 days.\n\nArizona Democratic U.S. Sen. Krysten Sinema argues extending the public health emergency “proves the need to delay lifting Title 42 to protect the health and safety of Arizona communities and migrants.” In a statement, she said she would “keep pushing for transparency and accountability from the administration to help secure the border, keep Arizona communities safe, and ensure migrants are treated fairly and humanely.”\n\nEarlier this month, she joined a bipartisan effort to prevent Title 42’s end until after the national public health emergency order ends. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., the lead Democratic cosponsor, filed the Public Health and Border Security Act of 2022. Joining him as Democratic cosponsors were Sinema and Sens. Joe Manchin from West Virginia, Jon Tester from Montana, and Maggie Hassan from New Hampshire.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jared Goldman, D-Maine, was the lead Democratic cosponsor of the companion bill in the House. Joining him were Democratic cosponsors, Reps. Tom O’Halleran and Greg Stanton of Arizona, Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and Tim Ryan of Ohio.\n\nThe bill isn’t likely to pass the House even if it were to pass the Senate.\n\nSo far, 22 states have sued to stop the administration from halting Title 42 in two separate lawsuits. Unless the Biden administration is stopped by the courts, DHS announced last month measures it was putting in place to prepare for up to 18,000 people a day expected to enter U.S. custody once Title 42 is lifted.\n\nThis estimate is in addition to the roughly 2 million people who were apprehended or encountered by Border Patrol agents in Biden’s first year in office while Title 42 was in place. All encounter numbers exclude “gotaways,” those who evade capture and don’t surrender at ports of entry.\n\nRepublished with the permission of The Center Square.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...', 'image': 'https://altoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Henry-cuellar-696x464.webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:27'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:48'}

In his own statement, Bennett warned Biden not to accede to Iranian demands to remove the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps from the U.S. designated terrorist list. Biden is said to be opposed to delisting the IRGC, but Iran is holding out for delisting as a condition for the U.S. reentry into the Iran nuclear deal, a key Biden foreign policy objective.\n\n“I am sure that President Biden, who is a true friend of Israel and cares about its security, will not allow the IRGC to be removed from the list of terrorist organizations,” Bennett said in his statement. “Israel has clarified its position on the issue: The IRGC is the largest terrorist organization in the world.”\n\nThe visit, which both offices said would happen within months, comes at a time when both leaders face political pressures: Biden is unpopular and Democrats might lose one or both chambers in Congress in the midterm elections. Bennett leads a coalition that now controls just 60 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or Israeli parliament, after a coalition member defected earlier this month.\n\nThe White House statement referred to recent tensions in Jerusalem over the Temple Mount, the holy site that has been a flashpoint for police clashes throughout the Muslim holiday month of Ramadan.\n\n“The President took note of ongoing efforts between Israeli and Palestinian officials to lower tensions and ensure a peaceful conclusion to the holy season of Ramadan,” the White House statement said.\n\nBiden also recommitted to full-fledged defense assistance to Israel, at a time when an increasing number of progressive Democrats are calling for some level of restriction on assistance to Israel.\n\nBiden “affirmed his unwavering support for Israel and its defense needs, and welcomed the historic $1 billion allocation to replenish Israel’s Iron Dome system,” the statement said, referring to money Israel asked for to replenish stores of the antimissile system depleted during last year’s Gaza conflict.', 'image': 'https://i1.wp.com/jweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/09-03-2021-Biden-Bennett.jpeg?w=1080&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C618px&ssl=1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:46'}

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,” McCarthy said. “And then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_mayorkasalejandro_042522gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:22'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:37'}

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge’s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called “this enormous threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac166314b8679c166f4e126f34de9b87e912373/0_296_5889_3533/master/5889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4c7c29ca50ead9e29c1693f5d2a70d2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

Administration officials have ruled out detaining migrant families with children, telling reporters Tuesday the practice started under President Barack Obama and expanded under President Donald Trump "is not a tool we are considering now."\n\nThe planned expansion of expedited removal could be restricted by some countries\' refusal to accept U.S. deportations. An administration official said the U.S. is hoping to forge new repatriation collaboration agreements with certain countries that would cut red tape for carrying out deportations.\n\nU.S. officials have historically struggled to return large numbers of migrants to certain countries like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela due to strained relations with their respective governments. In March, a record 32,000 Cubans and 16,000 Nicaraguans entered U.S. border custody, according to CBP data.\n\nAdministration officials characterized last week\'s diplomatic summit with Cuba as "productive," and "the beginning of a good dialogue." The U.S. delegation requested that Cuba once again accept Cuban deportees, while the U.S. agreed to restart immigrant visa processing in Havana, officials said.\n\nThe Biden administration is also asking countries that migrants transit through to help the U.S. reduce the number of arrivals to the Mexican border.\n\n"We\'re also asking that other countries step up and enforce their own immigration laws," one senior administration official said. "We really feel as though we need true responsibility sharing. We can\'t have countries, for instance, participating in controlled flow, where they\'re just allowing individuals to cross through without normal adjudication."\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas during a tour of the Panama Canal at the Miraflores Locks, in Panama City, Panama, on April 19, 2022.

"It\'s quite challenging in dealing with a country like Venezuela, where the diplomatic relations, if they exist at all, can be strained," Mayorkas told CBS News last week. "And so we have to be practical here in addressing the realities."\n\nFor its part, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has currently stationed 23,000 agents along the southwest border, according to Tuesday\'s memo, including 600 recently deployed personnel and law enforcement officers from across government agencies.\n\n"By May 23, we will be prepared to hold approximately 18,000 noncitizens in CBP custody at any given time, up from 13,000 at the beginning of 2021, and we have doubled our ability to transport noncitizens on a daily basis, with flexibility to increase further," the memo reads.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers Tuesday that both the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service will contribute resources to the border mission.\n\n"To be clear, we don\'t do border patrolling," Garland said, noting law enforcement under the purview of the Department of Justice is not trained for immigration enforcement. "But the Bureau of Prisons is going to make buses available for the transfers that Border Patrol needs assistance for. And the Marshall Service is going to be providing additional deputy U.S. Marshals to assist CBP at the border."\n\nThe Defense Department, meanwhile, will provide "rapid contracting support for air and ground transportation," according to a senior administration official, in addition to identifying potential locations for new temporary migrant holding facilities along the southwest border.\n\nOfficials also noted the Department of National Intelligence is "coordinating intelligence gathering and helping to support and strengthen our capability to get an early warning of migrant surges as they are building."\n\nDHS plans to expand the distribution of "age-appropriate" COVID-19 vaccines to migrants at two dozen CBP sites by May 23, in addition to its existing vaccination program for those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.\n\nOfficials also confirmed that MaryAnn Tierney, the regional administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will soon transition out of her short-lived role, where she led the newly established "Southwest Border Coordination Center." The center was established in February, and Mayorkas appointed Tierney shortly thereafter. Officials have yet to formally announce Tierney\'s replacement.\n\nTuesday\'s memo acknowledged "historic levels of migration" to the U.S. border. Apprehensions of migrants along the southern border soared to 221,000 last month, a 22-year high.

Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015.

A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:55'}

Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number.\n\nAlready the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House.\n\nMonths ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug Paxlovid against COVID.=-19 from the manufacturer Pfizer is lying on a table. Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.”\n\nNow, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nJapan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill.\n\n“We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.”\n\nComplicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.\n\nLast month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.\n\nAdministration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.\n\nThe funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.\n\nModerna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses.\n\nEarlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.\n\nRepublicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.\n\nThere are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage.\n\nSuch a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.\n\nRepublicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.\n\nIt would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.\n\n___', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6267ba122300002bf413a7d4.jpeg?cache=WRFAs9cO4t&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

Jamal Simmons, her communications director, announced a positive result earlier this month; Harris’ husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, contracted the virus in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vice president’s positive tests could create governing concerns given that Harris is the first in line of presidential succession to Biden, 79. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:23'}

So, there you go. No, I’m just confirming that for you. It is true, as we’ve noted many times, it is possible the president could test positive.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - A slow-rolling staff shakeup is under way at the White House as President Joe Biden girds for battle in the November midterm elections, where he hopes to help his Democrats hang on to control of the U.S. Congress.\n\nCedric Richmond, a former Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Louisiana who as the director of the White House office of Public Engagement has been a top adviser to Biden since the president\'s campaign for office, will depart to the private sector, a person briefed on the move said.\n\nRichmond will also become a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee, helping fundraise for the party and broadcasting its message, the person said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nMeanwhile, long-time Biden political and public relations adviser Anita Dunn is returning to the White House after departing last July to return to her communications firm, a second source briefed on the situation said.\n\nAt the same time, White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy plans to step down, as Reuters reported last week. And press secretary Jen Psaki is expected to depart in the weeks ahead, a move that may include several members of the White House press team as well, multiple administration sources say.\n\nIt is fairly standard for top White House officials to warn staff long before midterm and presidential elections that they should depart with plenty of lead time, or stay until the election is over. But it is unclear whether Biden\'s chief of staff Ron Klain has issued such a memo.\n\nMany political analysts believe Republicans are poised to take control of the House and possibly the Senate as well this November, as voters weigh in on inflation that has soared to a 40-year high on Biden\'s watch, and progressive groups disappointed in Biden\'s progress on climate and social issues stay home from the polls.\n\nRichmond will leave for a "new important role" at some point in the future, Psaki told reporters Monday, adding it was "something the president is excited about and has asked him to do." His departure was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nPsaki\'s primary deputy press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, is considered a top contender to take over when Psaki leaves, multiple sources within the White House said.\n\nOn a West Coast swing last week, Biden predicted Democrats could win two more U.S. Senate seats in November\'s midterms, strengthening the party\'s majority to pass his agenda despite sagging approval ratings.

This time period covers when Biden was running his presidential campaign culminating in his 2020 victory, and his first year occupying the White House.\n\nThe largest category of banned posts related to Biden's reputation for inappropriate contact, CensorTrack said. Biden was forced to address this during his campaign.\n\nIn one example cited by the organization, a user told CensorTrack that Facebook deleted one of their posts that showed Biden kissing someone - reportedly his granddaughter - on the lips.\n\nA caption with the image said: 'Find someone who kisses you the way Joe Biden kisses his granddaughter.' Screenshots sent by the user suggested that Facebook claimed the post breached its community rules on 'nudity or sexual activity.'\n\nMeanwhile, more than a quarter of the 646 actions taken against users were related to the Hunter Biden laptop story, broken by the New York Post, which involved a cache of 103,000 text messages, 154,000 emails, more than 2,000 photos and dozens of videos that were authenticated by experts retained by DailyMail.com.\n\nWhen the New York Post reported on the revelations, Twitter went as far as locking the newspaper's account for 17 days, and placed a 'warning label' on the GOP House Judiciary Committee's website after it linked to the story.\n\nCriticism of U.S. President Joe Biden on social medial platforms Twitter and Facebook was censored 646 times in two years, a new report has found\n\nEmails leaked from the computer sparked a scandal before the 2020 presidential election in October, but were dismissed as Russian disinformation by the Bidens and other senior Democrats, social media giants Twitter and Facebook, and several major media organizations.\n\nLast month however - after initially dismissing the story - the Washington Post finally admitted Hunter Biden's laptop is real, nine months after first receiving a copy and a full year after DailyMail.com authenticated it.\n\nA story based on the laptop's contents published by the newspaper focused on the millions of dollars Hunter and his uncle, Joe Biden's brother Jim, received from their partnership with a Chinese government-linked oil behemoth CEFC.\n\nThe Washington Post had cyber forensics experts validate material on the abandoned laptop hard drive, using similar methods that experts hired by DailyMail.com used back in March 2021.\n\nIts admission also followed a similar concession from the New York Times, which quietly noted 1,200 words into a long story published earlier in March that it had also validated material from the laptop.\n\nStories on Hunter Biden by the New York Times and The Washington Post were both allowed to be shared on their Twitter feeds.\n\nSome have suggested some of the media's suppression of the story could have contributed towards the 2020 election result falling in Biden's favor.\n\nCensorTrack also reported an example which saw the Big Tech companies ban users who blamed the current inflation crisis on Biden.\n\nIn one case, it said Facebook censored Heritage Action - the advocacy arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation - after the group posted a video on March 15 that quoted Biden's statements on energy policy.\n\nThe video in question showed Biden and other officials within his administration explaining how the energy policies would cause gas prices to rise.\n\nIn response, the Silicon Valley giant suppressed the post's reach on its platform.\n\nCensorTrack detailed 232 cases - more than a third of the anti-Biden content - that were categorized as 'comedic memes, videos, or generic posts about Biden's conduct.' The group also said some were banned for just quoting the now-President, for making him appear less than competent.\n\nIn one example cited by CensorTrack that was posted by news outlet Breaking 911 to Twitter, Biden was quote sarcastically saying 'Freedom! ... I have the freedom to kill you with my COVID. No, I mean, come on! Freedom?!' The post was deleted.\n\nMore than a quarter of the 646 actions taken against users were related to the New York Post's Hunter Biden laptop story, which documented alleged corrupt activity and found a collection of pictures of Hunter obtained after the FBI seized his laptop (pictured)\n\nFormer U.S. president Donald Trump, as well as lawmakers Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) were among senior politicians who were subject to bans or actions by the Big Tech companies, according to CensorTrack\n\nThe website shared a list of users who were censored by Facebook or Twitter, which included a number of influential figures in the United States.\n\nFormer U.S. president Donald Trump, as well as lawmakers Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) were among senior politicians who were subject to bans or actions by the Big Tech companies.\n\nOther figures that saw their accounts reprimanded included Donald Trump Jr., actor James Woods, and media personalities like the Daily Wire's Candace Owens and radio hosts Sebastian Gorka and Dana Loesch, CensorTrack said.\n\nFormer White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany saw her Twitter account locked when she attempted to share the Post's Hunter Biden story.\n\nMedia outlets were also targeted, including the New York Post, The Washington Free Beacon, the Federalist and The Babylon Bee - a satire site.\n\nThe research by the Media Research Center Think Tank, used a database collected by Free Speech America's CensorTrack, which logs and describes why people were censored on social media.\n\nCensorTrack said that it has so far received 3,600 overall reports of people who have seen their activities on Big Tech platforms censored for discussing a variety of issues, including climate change, race, Covid-19 and elections.\n\nAccording to the group's website, Free Speech America - which is behind CensorTrack - is working to stop what it calls censorship of conservatives.\n\nIts board of advisors includes Newt Gingrich, the former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA and Jenny Beth Martin, the Co-Founder of Tea Party Patriots - the largest national umbrella group without the Tea Party movement.\n\nThe release of the report comes as the world's richest man Elon Musk (pictured in April) clinched a deal to buy Twitter $44billion, in a transaction that will shift control of the social media platform populated by millions of users and global leaders\n\nElon Musk clinched a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion cash on Monday.\n\nIt is a seminal moment for the 16-year-old company, which emerged as one of the world's most influential public squares and now faces a string of challenges.\n\nMusk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, has criticized Twitter's moderation. He wants Twitter's algorithm for prioritizing tweets to be public and objects to giving too much power on the service to corporations that advertise.\n\nPolitical activists expect that a Musk regime will mean less moderation and reinstatement of banned individuals including former President Donald Trump. Conservatives cheered the prospect of fewer controls while some human rights activists voiced fears of a rise in hate speech.\n\nMusk has also advocated user-friendly tweaks to the service, such as an edit button and defeating 'spam bots' that send overwhelming amounts of unwanted tweets.\n\n'Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,' Musk said in a statement.\n\nIn a tweet last Tuesday before the deal was announced, Musk wrote: 'A social media platform’s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy,' suggesting he would aim to limit extreme political views on the platform.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/10/57061635-0-image-a-4_1650966443612.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:36'}

But he is the supervisor of this investigation."\n\nHighlighting public statements made in defense of the Biden family by top members of the administration, Hagerty asked Garland how Americans could have confidence that the department would conduct a "serious investigation."\n\n"Because we put the investigation in the hands of a Trump appointee from the previous administration, who is the United States attorney for the district of Delaware," Garland responded.

"I think our internal deliberations have to stay within the department."\n\nWhile President Biden has vowed not to interfere with investigations being conducted by the Justice Department, comments from several key officials from the White House, including White House chief of staff Ron Klain and White House press secretary Jen Psaki, have raised concern.\n\nEarlier this month, Klain said the president is "confident that his son didn’t break the law" as he insisted that "no one at the White House has involvement in" the investigation.\n\nBoth Psaki and Biden have maintained that the president has not spoken with his son about his business dealings.\n\nHunter Biden first revealed in December 2020 that his "tax affairs" were under federal investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Senate Homeland Security Committee and Senate Finance Committee conducted an investigation in 2020 into Hunter\'s foreign business dealings during his father\'s tenure as vice president and discovered that there were at least four large transactions that banks flagged as "potential criminal activity" to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\n\nOne of the suspicious transactions was a $100,000 payment from a subsidiary of CEFC China Energy – which was at the time owned by Chinese billionaire Ye Jianming – to Hunter\'s law firm, Owasco, in 2017.

Intelligence officials told Stefanik the question would be better answered by law enforcement.\n\nStefanik’s query, shared with The Associated Press by a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the classified meeting, reflects a widespread sentiment in the GOP that questions about the financial dealings of President Joe Biden’s son remain unanswered. And they say they intend to do something about it.\n\nAs Republicans prepare for a possible return to power amid rising hopes of winning the House and the Senate in the November elections, they are laying the groundwork to make Hunter Biden and his business dealings a central target of their investigative and oversight efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden’s memoir ‘Beautiful Things’ publishes in April\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staff have discussed analyzing specific messages and financial transactions found on the laptop and have also discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities involved in paying Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The conversations have been in the early stages but have included talks of bringing on Republican lawyers and former Justice Department officials to help lead the investigations, the people said.\n\nThe White House in turn is preparing to defend the Democratic president from any allegations of wrongdoing and make the case that Republicans are driven by opportunism. Democrats are likely to point out how Republicans did not seek investigations into President Donald Trump’s own business pursuits in Russia and China or into the foreign dealings of his children and son-in-law while they held key campaign or White House roles.\n\nIt all raises the possibility of a messy, politically explosive showdown between a GOP-controlled Congress and the White House, one that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nHunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”\n\nJoe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House declined to comment, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to an email.\n\nRepublican leaders see Hunter Biden as a unifying force that can bring together different factions of the GOP and potentially satiate those calling for more dramatic action. Some members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus have said the first order of business for a Republican majority should be an impeachment trial of Joe Biden in retaliation for the two impeachments of Trump.\n\nThere’s also increasing discussion among Republicans about urging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden says he’s facing federal investigation over ‘tax affairs’\n\n“Hunter Biden’s fair game because I believe Hunter Biden is a national security risk,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is in line to take over the House Oversight Committee if Republicans win the House. “Hopefully, when I get the gavel, we’ll take it a step further.”\n\nIn preparation, Comer’s oversight staff has already begun to make document requests and archived information related to the president’s son.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in October 2020 that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. The Kremlin had also interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee now want to probe the origins of a widely shared letter from 50 former intelligence officials released a week after the New York Post story. The letter claimed the laptop carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation” and suggested that “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”\n\nJoe Biden in the second presidential debate, responding to Trump’s reference to the “laptop from hell,” said “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant.” That statement went further than the letter, though it was immediately and widely reported as having labeled the laptop as disinformation. Trump and many Republicans accused Biden of invoking Russia to avoid scrutiny about his son.\n\nNo evidence has emerged since of any Russian connections to the laptop or the emails. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment of the 2020 election alleged that Russian leader Vladimir Putin authorized multiple efforts in support of Trump. Russian state media amplified “disparaging content” about Biden “including stories centered on his son,” the assessment said, which also alleges Putin had “purview” over the activities of a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, called allegations that the Russians were behind the laptop “absurd.” Stefanik in a statement said “any alleged attempt by the intelligence agencies or intelligence community leadership to portray the facts surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop as misinformation needs to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who in 2020 issued a report on Hunter Biden and his work on behalf of Ukraine gas company Burisma, recently made a presentation on the Senate floor laying out allegations they say the media have ignored but the Justice Department and Congress need to investigate.\n\n“The Biden administration has been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests,” Grassley said.\n\nFor now, the Biden administration and many top Democrats are not commenting publicly on Hunter Biden. But the White House has already reassigned communications staff to prepare to respond to GOP investigations of Hunter Biden and other likely targets, including the origins of the coronavirus and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDemocrats are expected to argue that Hunter Biden is ultimately a distraction to most voters concerned about domestic issues. The current House Oversight chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, previewed that argument in a statement responding to Comer, her Republican counterpart.\n\nSaid Maloney: “I’d hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be more focused on delivering for the American people than on phony outrage.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2022/04/2022-04-18T164916Z_950030436_RC2RPT9FSFOE_RTRMADP_3_RELIGION-EASTER-WHITE-HOUSE-1024x682.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:57'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the administration, argued there was no way the government could detain so many asylum seekers for months or years. She cited a report that said there were 220,000 migrants apprehended at or near the border in March but only 32,000 beds in detention facilities.\n\n“No one disputes that the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] does not have sufficient detention capacity” to hold all those migrants, she said.\n\nThe government’s only reasonable option, she said, was to release most of them if they are judged likely to return when their asylum claim is due to be heard.\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh questioned whether that’s what Congress intended. Is there any hint “that anyone in Congress expected that if there was not sufficient detention capacity that hundreds of thousands of people would be paroled into the United States without being lawfully admitted?” he asked.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. agreed the administration’s position would permit unlimited number of migrants to be admitted and released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There aren’t enough beds in detention. So there is no limit, as you read the statute, to the number of people that you can release into the United States, right?” he told the solicitor general.\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration chose a different option and sent many of the Central American migrants back to the Mexican side of the border. Its officials did so believing the move would deter more migrants from traveling north.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argued that Trump’s policy was cruel and inhumane. They said it forced tens of thousands of people from Central America to live in squalid conditions subject to violence and abuse. Upon taking office, President Biden said he planned to repeal Trump’s policy.\n\nBut state lawyers for Texas and Missouri sued and last year won nationwide orders from judges that required the new administration to maintain the prior Trump policy. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order in the Texas case.\n\nIn August of last year, the justices by a 6-3 vote refused an emergency appeal seeking to overturn the judge’s orders. And there was no clear sign during Tuesday’s argument the majority will do so now.\n\nTraditionally, the court has given the executive branch broad authority to enforce the immigration laws, including reversing the policies of prior administrations.\n\nPrelogar said it would be a radical departure for the court to say the new administration must maintain the new policies put in place by the prior administration. Prior to 2019, no administration or member of Congress had asserted the immigration law required the government to detain every noncitizen who had a pending asylum claim, she said.\n\nBut lurking in the background is the long legal fight over DACA, the Obama-era policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. President Obama used his authority under the immigration laws to suspend enforcement against young people who were brought illegally to this country when they were children.\n\nTrump moved to repeal that policy, but judges in California and New York put the repeal on hold. Lawyers for Trump argued the new president had ample authority to revoke a discretionary enforcement policy adopted by Obama.\n\nTwo years ago, however, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote ruled against Trump and blocked the repeal.\n\nNow in the case of Biden vs. Texas, the justices will rule on whether the new administration is free to repeal Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy.\n\nA decision can be expected by late June.', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f7a67b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2Fde%2Fa50bba424e1eb301ca3265187af2%2F914957-na-pol-0210-supreme-court-kkn-11150.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:48'}

The public health order, which has been used by both the Biden and Trump administrations to expel a majority of migrants at the border due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will end on May 23.\n\nRepublicans and moderate Democrats have sounded the alarm about a massive surge in migration at the border on top of the already sky-high numbers that the administration has itself called "historic." DHS has been planning for up to 18,000 migrants a day and the current March numbers of 210,000 a month are expected to increase in the months ahead.\n\nDemocratic senators in particular have called for the Biden administration to have a plan in place before Title 42 is lifted and have introduced legislation in an attempt to make the administration implement such a plan. DHS has protested that it does, in fact, have a plan for the coming surge.\n\nThe six-step plan released by the administration involves the surging of resources, including medical support and transportation to the border, as well as initiatives to streamline the processing of migrants from the border to their release into the interior of the United States.\n\nHowever, the agency claims it is also administering consequences for unlawful entry, including the use of Expedited Removal (ER), which can allow for the rapid removal of recently arrived illegal immigrants. However, Border Patrol agents have told Fox News that if a migrant claims they have a fear of persecution, the removal order is changed to a Notice to Appear – meaning they are released into the United States with a future court date.\n\nThey said that migrants are already spreading the word about what to say to get released into the U.S. as the administration has already been increased its use of ER to remove illegal immigrants from Northern Triangle countries.\n\nA senior administration official, in a call with reporters, said there was no plan to use family detention as a way to help deal with the surge. However, the use of ER would allow for the use of detention for single adults. The administration has also stressed that it intends to remove "promptly" those who are allowed in, go through immigration proceedings, and are found not to have a valid asylum case.\n\nThe other pillars of the administration’s plan includes bolstering the capacity of non-governmental organizations to receive migrants after they’ve been processed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). NGOs often help migrants with travel, housing and other assistance after they are released.\n\nFinally, the administration say it will target and disrupt transnational criminal organizations who facilitate illegal immigration, and also deter illegal migration throughout the Hemisphere. It pointed to new migration agreements with Panama and Costa Rica, as well as "close cooperation with Mexico."\n\n"We are also sending a clear message in the region to counteract misinformation from smugglers, including that the termination of the Title 42 public health Order does not mean that the U.S. border is open," the memo says.\n\n58-MEMBER BIPARTISAN HOUSE PROBLEM SOLVERS CAUCUS BACKS BILL TO EXTEND TITLE 42\n\nMayorkas ends the memo by admitting that the migrant surge will "substantially strain" resources at the border, and instead calls on Congress to pass solutions to fix what the administration has claimed is a "broken" system.\n\n"Despite the efforts of our dedicated DHS workforce and our partners executing this comprehensive plan, a significant increase in migrant encounters will substantially strain our system even further," he says.\n\n"As it has since its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that holistically addresses the root causes of migration, strengthens border security, fixes our immigration system, and improves legal pathways," the memo says.\n\nThat legislation was quickly rejected by Republicans early last year due to its inclusion of a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants in the country, combined with a lack of border security measures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublican states have sued the Biden administration in a bid to stop the order being lifted on May 23.

Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from the border town of Laredo, Texas, told Fox News Sunday that Biden was listening to immigration activists, not border communities or their representatives such as himself.\n\n“But my question is, who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue?” he asked, referring to Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol agents.\n\n“And more importantly, who’s listening to the border communities, the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people that live on the border?” he asked.\n\nCuellar is facing a tough runoff election May 24 and, if he wins, a tough general election in November.\n\n“How can we have the federal public emergency extended to July 15 and say there’s a pandemic going on in the United States, but at the border, everything’s fine, and just let people into the United States,” he said, adding, “Those are mixed messages.”\n\nHe also addressed the administration’s mixed messages when it comes to mandates. “How can you ask for international travelers to make sure … they’re vaccinated or even show their COVID-19 negative tests if they fly in?” Cueller asked, referring to vaccine mandates imposed on legal travelers when no such requirements exist for those who’ve entered the U.S. illegally and are then released into the U.S. by the Biden administration.\n\nCuellar also posted pictures of existing overcrowded holding facilities at the border with Title 42 in place.\n\n“Title 42 is critical to ensuring the health and safety of migrants, law enforcement, and border residents,” he said.\n\nDemocratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak wrote Biden late last week expressing concerns about Title 42 ending. He asked him “to reconsider any intentions of undoing Title 42 until there is a comprehensive plan for how the United States can avoid the humanitarian crisis this policy change would spark.”\n\nThe CDC issued a statement on April 1 announcing it was ending Title 42 due to “an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics)” and said, “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.”\n\nInstead, the Department of Homeland Security was implementing “appropriate COVID-19 mitigation protocols, such as scaling up a program to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to migrants and prepare for resumption of regular migration under Title 8,” the CDC said.\n\nBut on April 12, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra announced he was renewing the national public health emergency order “as a result of the continued consequences of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.” He said the public health emergency “exists and has existed since January 27, 2020, nationwide,” and was renewed by the Trump and Biden administrations eight times.\n\nSet to expire April 15, it was renewed effective April 16 for an additional 90 days.\n\nArizona Democratic U.S. Sen. Krysten Sinema argues extending the public health emergency “proves the need to delay lifting Title 42 to protect the health and safety of Arizona communities and migrants.” In a statement, she said she would “keep pushing for transparency and accountability from the administration to help secure the border, keep Arizona communities safe, and ensure migrants are treated fairly and humanely.”\n\nEarlier this month, she joined a bipartisan effort to prevent Title 42’s end until after the national public health emergency order ends. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., the lead Democratic cosponsor, filed the Public Health and Border Security Act of 2022. Joining him as Democratic cosponsors were Sinema and Sens. Joe Manchin from West Virginia, Jon Tester from Montana, and Maggie Hassan from New Hampshire.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jared Goldman, D-Maine, was the lead Democratic cosponsor of the companion bill in the House. Joining him were Democratic cosponsors, Reps. Tom O’Halleran and Greg Stanton of Arizona, Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and Tim Ryan of Ohio.\n\nThe bill isn’t likely to pass the House even if it were to pass the Senate.\n\nSo far, 22 states have sued to stop the administration from halting Title 42 in two separate lawsuits. Unless the Biden administration is stopped by the courts, DHS announced last month measures it was putting in place to prepare for up to 18,000 people a day expected to enter U.S. custody once Title 42 is lifted.\n\nThis estimate is in addition to the roughly 2 million people who were apprehended or encountered by Border Patrol agents in Biden’s first year in office while Title 42 was in place. All encounter numbers exclude “gotaways,” those who evade capture and don’t surrender at ports of entry.\n\nRepublished with the permission of The Center Square.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...', 'image': 'https://altoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Henry-cuellar-696x464.webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:27'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:48'}

In his own statement, Bennett warned Biden not to accede to Iranian demands to remove the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps from the U.S. designated terrorist list. Biden is said to be opposed to delisting the IRGC, but Iran is holding out for delisting as a condition for the U.S. reentry into the Iran nuclear deal, a key Biden foreign policy objective.\n\n“I am sure that President Biden, who is a true friend of Israel and cares about its security, will not allow the IRGC to be removed from the list of terrorist organizations,” Bennett said in his statement. “Israel has clarified its position on the issue: The IRGC is the largest terrorist organization in the world.”\n\nThe visit, which both offices said would happen within months, comes at a time when both leaders face political pressures: Biden is unpopular and Democrats might lose one or both chambers in Congress in the midterm elections.

We can save more lives by getting the medication to more people.”\n\nDoubling pharmacies that stock Paxlovid\n\nSenior administration officials said during Monday’s call with reporters that the White House is working to nearly double the number of pharmacies throughout the country that stock the antiviral, which must be taken within five days of COVID-19 symptoms following a positive test result.\n\nThose officials said about 20,000 pharmacies currently have Paxlovid available for people with prescriptions from a health care provider, but they hope to soon ramp up to 30,000 before eventually reaching 40,000. The pharmacies will be able to order it for free from the federal government, one official said.\n\nThe administration officials said there aren’t currently any plans to expand the pool of those eligible for prescriptions of Paxlovid beyond the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization.\n\nBut the officials hope that getting the antiviral in more pharmacies and talking with doctors will help eliminate a “scarcity mindset” about the drug that has lingered, dating from the months when it was in relatively short supply.\n\nDuring that period, the officials said, many doctors would prescribe Paxlovid to only the sickest patients, instead of anyone who would qualify under the emergency use authorization.\n\nPaxlovid can reduce the “proportion of people with COVID-19 related hospitalization or death from any cause by 88% compared to placebo among patients treated within five days of symptom onset and who did not receive COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatment,” according to the FDA’s statement from December.\n\nThe Biden administration is “in the process of buying 20 million pills of Paxlovid,” as part of the new effort, according to one of the administration officials.\n\n“We have sufficient funding to secure these treatments,” the official continued. “What I think we’re really worried about going forward are future treatments.”\n\nCongress stuck on funding\n\nThe message runs in slight contrast to the Biden administration’s push to get Congress to approve the $22.5 billion in funding.\n\nThe months long delay has led the Biden administration to scale back the number of monoclonal antibodies it sends to state governments by one-third and to end a program providing COVID-19 testing, treatments and vaccines to uninsured people.\n\nWhtie House press secretary Jen Psaki has warned that without more funding from Congress, testing capacity will begin to drop off in June.\n\nShe’s also cautioned that the U.S. government likely wouldn’t have funding to provide free booster shots to all Americans in the event the FDA authorizes and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone get a booster shot later this year.\n\nPsaki said on April 20 that the Biden administration needs additional COVID-19 funding “as soon as possible” because the White House already “had to take steps… like ending our program for the uninsured.”\n\n“We haven’t been able to make purchases that we would normally purchase to get ahead,” Psaki continued during the White House press briefing. “Even on monoclonal antibodies or some of these treatments, some of them take months to make. So it already puts us behind where we need to be and want to be in planning. So, we don’t have a long-term deadline, nor would I punt that out. We want to do it as quickly as possible when they return.”\n\nThe U.S. Senate returned from a two-week spring recess Monday and the U.S. House is set to gavel back into session Tuesday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Monday on the floor that he hopes to reach agreement with Republicans in the coming weeks on the money for COVID-19.\n\n“The longer that Senate Republicans hold out on working with us to approve new funding, the higher the cost will be for our country down the line,” Schumer said. “As we’ve learned already, it doesn’t take much for a new variant to undo a lot of the progress we’ve made in recent months.”\n\nTitle 42\n\nThe disagreement in the Senate isn’t on the bill itself, Schumer and Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney reached a bipartisan agreement for $10 billion earlier this month.\n\nThe debate is over whether Democrats, who control the 50-50 Senate, will allow amendments to the package addressing Title 42.\n\nThe Trump-era designation from the CDC allows border patrol officials to expel migrants, including asylum seekers, at the Southern border as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nThe Biden administration expects to end the program in late May, a decision that many expect will lead to an increase in the number of migrants entering the country.\n\nRepublicans and numerous centrist Democrats have urged the Biden administration to keep the Title 42 designation in place.\n\nBiden, so far, has said he doesn’t plan to do that. But a federal judge in Louisiana said Monday he plans to temporarily block the White House from lifting the designation.\n\nIf Schumer allows a floor vote on a Title 42 amendment it would likely get attached to the COVID-19 spending package, a change to the bill that could doom its ability to pass the U.S. House or lead to Biden vetoing the legislation altogether.\n\nPsaki said Monday evening she didn’t want to comment on whether Biden would veto a bill that changes the rules for how Title 42 is administered.\n\n“There’s a lot of steps between now and then. So, at this point, that’s very premature,” Psaki said. “There are many members who strongly would like to see Title 42 extended. There are many who strongly have the other point of view. So, we are not anywhere near that point in time.”', 'image': 'https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Swab-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:05:07'}

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,” McCarthy said. “And then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_mayorkasalejandro_042522gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:22'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:37'}

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge’s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called “this enormous threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac166314b8679c166f4e126f34de9b87e912373/0_296_5889_3533/master/5889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4c7c29ca50ead9e29c1693f5d2a70d2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

Administration officials have ruled out detaining migrant families with children, telling reporters Tuesday the practice started under President Barack Obama and expanded under President Donald Trump "is not a tool we are considering now."\n\nThe planned expansion of expedited removal could be restricted by some countries\' refusal to accept U.S. deportations. An administration official said the U.S. is hoping to forge new repatriation collaboration agreements with certain countries that would cut red tape for carrying out deportations.\n\nU.S. officials have historically struggled to return large numbers of migrants to certain countries like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela due to strained relations with their respective governments. In March, a record 32,000 Cubans and 16,000 Nicaraguans entered U.S. border custody, according to CBP data.\n\nAdministration officials characterized last week\'s diplomatic summit with Cuba as "productive," and "the beginning of a good dialogue." The U.S. delegation requested that Cuba once again accept Cuban deportees, while the U.S. agreed to restart immigrant visa processing in Havana, officials said.\n\nThe Biden administration is also asking countries that migrants transit through to help the U.S. reduce the number of arrivals to the Mexican border.\n\n"We\'re also asking that other countries step up and enforce their own immigration laws," one senior administration official said. "We really feel as though we need true responsibility sharing. We can\'t have countries, for instance, participating in controlled flow, where they\'re just allowing individuals to cross through without normal adjudication."\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas during a tour of the Panama Canal at the Miraflores Locks, in Panama City, Panama, on April 19, 2022.

"It\'s quite challenging in dealing with a country like Venezuela, where the diplomatic relations, if they exist at all, can be strained," Mayorkas told CBS News last week. "And so we have to be practical here in addressing the realities."\n\nFor its part, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has currently stationed 23,000 agents along the southwest border, according to Tuesday\'s memo, including 600 recently deployed personnel and law enforcement officers from across government agencies.\n\n"By May 23, we will be prepared to hold approximately 18,000 noncitizens in CBP custody at any given time, up from 13,000 at the beginning of 2021, and we have doubled our ability to transport noncitizens on a daily basis, with flexibility to increase further," the memo reads.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers Tuesday that both the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service will contribute resources to the border mission.\n\n"To be clear, we don\'t do border patrolling," Garland said, noting law enforcement under the purview of the Department of Justice is not trained for immigration enforcement. "But the Bureau of Prisons is going to make buses available for the transfers that Border Patrol needs assistance for. And the Marshall Service is going to be providing additional deputy U.S. Marshals to assist CBP at the border."\n\nThe Defense Department, meanwhile, will provide "rapid contracting support for air and ground transportation," according to a senior administration official, in addition to identifying potential locations for new temporary migrant holding facilities along the southwest border.\n\nOfficials also noted the Department of National Intelligence is "coordinating intelligence gathering and helping to support and strengthen our capability to get an early warning of migrant surges as they are building."\n\nDHS plans to expand the distribution of "age-appropriate" COVID-19 vaccines to migrants at two dozen CBP sites by May 23, in addition to its existing vaccination program for those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.\n\nOfficials also confirmed that MaryAnn Tierney, the regional administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will soon transition out of her short-lived role, where she led the newly established "Southwest Border Coordination Center." The center was established in February, and Mayorkas appointed Tierney shortly thereafter. Officials have yet to formally announce Tierney\'s replacement.\n\nTuesday\'s memo acknowledged "historic levels of migration" to the U.S. border.

Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015. Joe Biden was vice president during this time. The contact between Joe Biden and Schwerin directly contradicts Joe Biden’s repeated claims he was never involved in the family business. The Post’s reporting adds a twelfth instance Joe Biden has been involved in the family’s business scheme.\n\nDOOCY: "The President has said that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings.

Sixty percent say Hunter Biden has sold “influence and access” to Joe Biden. The poll also shows 67 percent believe Joe Biden should be impeached if he “secretly participated and facilitated” in the family’s business.\n\nText messages from 2019 on Hunter’s “laptop from hell” depict the Biden family payout mechanism. The instrument indicates a collection of 50 percent of familial salaries for 30 years.\n\n“I hope you all can do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family for 30 years,” Hunter texted to his daughter in 2019. “It’s really hard. But don’t worry, unlike Pop [Joe], I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\n\nThe Biden’s family payment mechanism of collecting 50 percent of family salaries for 30 years could be legal “predicates” for racketeering charges, according to former Utah U.S. attorney Brett Tolman.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter and Gettr @WendellHusebø.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:55'}

And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House.\n\nMonths ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug Paxlovid against COVID.=-19 from the manufacturer Pfizer is lying on a table. Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.”\n\nNow, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nJapan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill.\n\n“We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.”\n\nComplicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.\n\nLast month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.\n\nAdministration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.\n\nThe funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.\n\nModerna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses.\n\nEarlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.\n\nRepublicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.\n\nThere are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage.\n\nSuch a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.\n\nRepublicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.\n\nIt would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.\n\n___', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6267ba122300002bf413a7d4.jpeg?cache=WRFAs9cO4t&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

He was charged in 1964 after he attempted to sell a copy of a Secret Service file and served several years in federal custody, the White House said.\n\nThe president is also pardoning Betty Jo Bogans, a Houston woman who was convicted in 1998 of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine. Bogans, 51, was attempting to transport drugs for her boyfriend and his accomplice, neither of whom were arrested, the White House said. She received a seven-year sentence despite having no prior record.\n\nThe third individual being pardoned on Tuesday is Dexter Jackson, a 52-year-old from Georgia who was convicted in 2002 for facilitating the distribution of marijuana through his business. Jackson was not directly involved in trafficking drugs, but allowed his business to be used for transactions. He pleaded guilty and served his sentence.\n\nIn addition to the three pardons, Biden is also commuting the sentences of 75 people who were charged with nonviolent drug crimes and are either serving prison time, under house arrest or are on supervised release.\n\nAll 75 “have made efforts to rehabilitate themselves, including through educational and vocational training or drug treatment in prison,” the White House said.\n\n“While today’s announcement marks important progress, my Administration will continue to\n\nreview clemency petitions and deliver reforms that advance equity and justice, provide second chances, and enhance the wellbeing and safety of all Americans,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nCriminal justice groups had urged Biden for months to use his clemency powers to provide relief for individuals serving lengthy sentences for nonviolent crimes, particularly as jails were overcrowded amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Jamal Simmons, her communications director, announced a positive result earlier this month; Harris’ husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, contracted the virus in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vice president’s positive tests could create governing concerns given that Harris is the first in line of presidential succession to Biden, 79. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:23'}

Intelligence officials told Stefanik the question would be better answered by law enforcement.\n\nStefanik’s query, shared with The Associated Press by a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the classified meeting, reflects a widespread sentiment in the GOP that questions about the financial dealings of President Joe Biden’s son remain unanswered. And they say they intend to do something about it.\n\nAs Republicans prepare for a possible return to power amid rising hopes of winning the House and the Senate in the November elections, they are laying the groundwork to make Hunter Biden and his business dealings a central target of their investigative and oversight efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden’s memoir ‘Beautiful Things’ publishes in April\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staff have discussed analyzing specific messages and financial transactions found on the laptop and have also discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities involved in paying Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The conversations have been in the early stages but have included talks of bringing on Republican lawyers and former Justice Department officials to help lead the investigations, the people said.\n\nThe White House in turn is preparing to defend the Democratic president from any allegations of wrongdoing and make the case that Republicans are driven by opportunism. Democrats are likely to point out how Republicans did not seek investigations into President Donald Trump’s own business pursuits in Russia and China or into the foreign dealings of his children and son-in-law while they held key campaign or White House roles.\n\nIt all raises the possibility of a messy, politically explosive showdown between a GOP-controlled Congress and the White House, one that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nHunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”\n\nJoe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House declined to comment, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to an email.\n\nRepublican leaders see Hunter Biden as a unifying force that can bring together different factions of the GOP and potentially satiate those calling for more dramatic action. Some members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus have said the first order of business for a Republican majority should be an impeachment trial of Joe Biden in retaliation for the two impeachments of Trump.\n\nThere’s also increasing discussion among Republicans about urging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden says he’s facing federal investigation over ‘tax affairs’\n\n“Hunter Biden’s fair game because I believe Hunter Biden is a national security risk,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is in line to take over the House Oversight Committee if Republicans win the House. “Hopefully, when I get the gavel, we’ll take it a step further.”\n\nIn preparation, Comer’s oversight staff has already begun to make document requests and archived information related to the president’s son.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in October 2020 that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. The Kremlin had also interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee now want to probe the origins of a widely shared letter from 50 former intelligence officials released a week after the New York Post story. The letter claimed the laptop carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation” and suggested that “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”\n\nJoe Biden in the second presidential debate, responding to Trump’s reference to the “laptop from hell,” said “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant.” That statement went further than the letter, though it was immediately and widely reported as having labeled the laptop as disinformation. Trump and many Republicans accused Biden of invoking Russia to avoid scrutiny about his son.\n\nNo evidence has emerged since of any Russian connections to the laptop or the emails. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment of the 2020 election alleged that Russian leader Vladimir Putin authorized multiple efforts in support of Trump. Russian state media amplified “disparaging content” about Biden “including stories centered on his son,” the assessment said, which also alleges Putin had “purview” over the activities of a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, called allegations that the Russians were behind the laptop “absurd.” Stefanik in a statement said “any alleged attempt by the intelligence agencies or intelligence community leadership to portray the facts surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop as misinformation needs to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who in 2020 issued a report on Hunter Biden and his work on behalf of Ukraine gas company Burisma, recently made a presentation on the Senate floor laying out allegations they say the media have ignored but the Justice Department and Congress need to investigate.\n\n“The Biden administration has been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests,” Grassley said.\n\nFor now, the Biden administration and many top Democrats are not commenting publicly on Hunter Biden. But the White House has already reassigned communications staff to prepare to respond to GOP investigations of Hunter Biden and other likely targets, including the origins of the coronavirus and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDemocrats are expected to argue that Hunter Biden is ultimately a distraction to most voters concerned about domestic issues. The current House Oversight chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, previewed that argument in a statement responding to Comer, her Republican counterpart.\n\nSaid Maloney: “I’d hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be more focused on delivering for the American people than on phony outrage.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2022/04/2022-04-18T164916Z_950030436_RC2RPT9FSFOE_RTRMADP_3_RELIGION-EASTER-WHITE-HOUSE-1024x682.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:57'}

It deals with his foreign ties dating back to when his father was Obama's vice president.\n\nThe New York Post recently reported that one of Biden's son's top business partners, Eric Schwerin, met with Biden at the White House in 2010.\n\nSchwerin is the former president of Hunter Biden's investment firm Rosemont Seneca.\n\nHis visit with Biden was one of 19 total he paid to the White House, visitor logs uncovered by The Post reveal.\n\nThe president has on multiple occasions denied having anything to do with his son's business dealings.\n\nWhen asked about the report on Monday, Psaki said she had 'no information' on the matter.\n\nThe ongoing tax fraud investigation into Hunter Biden reportedly involves a laptop that was linked to him and contains numerous correspondences about his business.\n\nIt also may contain information that Biden did indeed profit off of his son's dealings.

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the administration, argued there was no way the government could detain so many asylum seekers for months or years. She cited a report that said there were 220,000 migrants apprehended at or near the border in March but only 32,000 beds in detention facilities.\n\n“No one disputes that the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] does not have sufficient detention capacity” to hold all those migrants, she said.\n\nThe government’s only reasonable option, she said, was to release most of them if they are judged likely to return when their asylum claim is due to be heard.\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh questioned whether that’s what Congress intended. Is there any hint “that anyone in Congress expected that if there was not sufficient detention capacity that hundreds of thousands of people would be paroled into the United States without being lawfully admitted?” he asked.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. agreed the administration’s position would permit unlimited number of migrants to be admitted and released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There aren’t enough beds in detention. So there is no limit, as you read the statute, to the number of people that you can release into the United States, right?” he told the solicitor general.\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration chose a different option and sent many of the Central American migrants back to the Mexican side of the border. Its officials did so believing the move would deter more migrants from traveling north.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argued that Trump’s policy was cruel and inhumane. They said it forced tens of thousands of people from Central America to live in squalid conditions subject to violence and abuse. Upon taking office, President Biden said he planned to repeal Trump’s policy.\n\nBut state lawyers for Texas and Missouri sued and last year won nationwide orders from judges that required the new administration to maintain the prior Trump policy. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order in the Texas case.\n\nIn August of last year, the justices by a 6-3 vote refused an emergency appeal seeking to overturn the judge’s orders. And there was no clear sign during Tuesday’s argument the majority will do so now.\n\nTraditionally, the court has given the executive branch broad authority to enforce the immigration laws, including reversing the policies of prior administrations.\n\nPrelogar said it would be a radical departure for the court to say the new administration must maintain the new policies put in place by the prior administration. Prior to 2019, no administration or member of Congress had asserted the immigration law required the government to detain every noncitizen who had a pending asylum claim, she said.\n\nBut lurking in the background is the long legal fight over DACA, the Obama-era policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. President Obama used his authority under the immigration laws to suspend enforcement against young people who were brought illegally to this country when they were children.\n\nTrump moved to repeal that policy, but judges in California and New York put the repeal on hold. Lawyers for Trump argued the new president had ample authority to revoke a discretionary enforcement policy adopted by Obama.\n\nTwo years ago, however, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote ruled against Trump and blocked the repeal.\n\nNow in the case of Biden vs. Texas, the justices will rule on whether the new administration is free to repeal Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy.\n\nA decision can be expected by late June.', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f7a67b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2Fde%2Fa50bba424e1eb301ca3265187af2%2F914957-na-pol-0210-supreme-court-kkn-11150.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:48'}

The public health order, which has been used by both the Biden and Trump administrations to expel a majority of migrants at the border due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will end on May 23.\n\nRepublicans and moderate Democrats have sounded the alarm about a massive surge in migration at the border on top of the already sky-high numbers that the administration has itself called "historic." DHS has been planning for up to 18,000 migrants a day and the current March numbers of 210,000 a month are expected to increase in the months ahead.\n\nDemocratic senators in particular have called for the Biden administration to have a plan in place before Title 42 is lifted and have introduced legislation in an attempt to make the administration implement such a plan. DHS has protested that it does, in fact, have a plan for the coming surge.\n\nThe six-step plan released by the administration involves the surging of resources, including medical support and transportation to the border, as well as initiatives to streamline the processing of migrants from the border to their release into the interior of the United States.\n\nHowever, the agency claims it is also administering consequences for unlawful entry, including the use of Expedited Removal (ER), which can allow for the rapid removal of recently arrived illegal immigrants. However, Border Patrol agents have told Fox News that if a migrant claims they have a fear of persecution, the removal order is changed to a Notice to Appear – meaning they are released into the United States with a future court date.\n\nThey said that migrants are already spreading the word about what to say to get released into the U.S. as the administration has already been increased its use of ER to remove illegal immigrants from Northern Triangle countries.\n\nA senior administration official, in a call with reporters, said there was no plan to use family detention as a way to help deal with the surge. However, the use of ER would allow for the use of detention for single adults. The administration has also stressed that it intends to remove "promptly" those who are allowed in, go through immigration proceedings, and are found not to have a valid asylum case.\n\nThe other pillars of the administration’s plan includes bolstering the capacity of non-governmental organizations to receive migrants after they’ve been processed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). NGOs often help migrants with travel, housing and other assistance after they are released.\n\nFinally, the administration say it will target and disrupt transnational criminal organizations who facilitate illegal immigration, and also deter illegal migration throughout the Hemisphere. It pointed to new migration agreements with Panama and Costa Rica, as well as "close cooperation with Mexico."\n\n"We are also sending a clear message in the region to counteract misinformation from smugglers, including that the termination of the Title 42 public health Order does not mean that the U.S. border is open," the memo says.\n\n58-MEMBER BIPARTISAN HOUSE PROBLEM SOLVERS CAUCUS BACKS BILL TO EXTEND TITLE 42\n\nMayorkas ends the memo by admitting that the migrant surge will "substantially strain" resources at the border, and instead calls on Congress to pass solutions to fix what the administration has claimed is a "broken" system.\n\n"Despite the efforts of our dedicated DHS workforce and our partners executing this comprehensive plan, a significant increase in migrant encounters will substantially strain our system even further," he says.\n\n"As it has since its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that holistically addresses the root causes of migration, strengthens border security, fixes our immigration system, and improves legal pathways," the memo says.\n\nThat legislation was quickly rejected by Republicans early last year due to its inclusion of a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants in the country, combined with a lack of border security measures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublican states have sued the Biden administration in a bid to stop the order being lifted on May 23. The states won a temporary restraining order on Monday as the case proceeds, although details of the order are not clear.\n\nThe 21 states are hoping to secure a preliminary injunction barring the lifting of the order after a hearing on May 13.', 'image': 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1358276236.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

On April 1, the CDC announced it was terminating it on May 23.\n\nU.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from the border town of Laredo, Texas, told Fox News Sunday that Biden was listening to immigration activists, not border communities or their representatives such as himself.\n\n“But my question is, who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue?” he asked, referring to Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol agents.\n\n“And more importantly, who’s listening to the border communities, the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people that live on the border?” he asked.\n\nCuellar is facing a tough runoff election May 24 and, if he wins, a tough general election in November.\n\n“How can we have the federal public emergency extended to July 15 and say there’s a pandemic going on in the United States, but at the border, everything’s fine, and just let people into the United States,” he said, adding, “Those are mixed messages.”\n\nHe also addressed the administration’s mixed messages when it comes to mandates. “How can you ask for international travelers to make sure … they’re vaccinated or even show their COVID-19 negative tests if they fly in?” Cueller asked, referring to vaccine mandates imposed on legal travelers when no such requirements exist for those who’ve entered the U.S. illegally and are then released into the U.S. by the Biden administration.\n\nCuellar also posted pictures of existing overcrowded holding facilities at the border with Title 42 in place.\n\n“Title 42 is critical to ensuring the health and safety of migrants, law enforcement, and border residents,” he said.\n\nDemocratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak wrote Biden late last week expressing concerns about Title 42 ending. He asked him “to reconsider any intentions of undoing Title 42 until there is a comprehensive plan for how the United States can avoid the humanitarian crisis this policy change would spark.”\n\nThe CDC issued a statement on April 1 announcing it was ending Title 42 due to “an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics)” and said, “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.”\n\nInstead, the Department of Homeland Security was implementing “appropriate COVID-19 mitigation protocols, such as scaling up a program to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to migrants and prepare for resumption of regular migration under Title 8,” the CDC said.\n\nBut on April 12, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra announced he was renewing the national public health emergency order “as a result of the continued consequences of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.” He said the public health emergency “exists and has existed since January 27, 2020, nationwide,” and was renewed by the Trump and Biden administrations eight times.\n\nSet to expire April 15, it was renewed effective April 16 for an additional 90 days.\n\nArizona Democratic U.S. Sen. Krysten Sinema argues extending the public health emergency “proves the need to delay lifting Title 42 to protect the health and safety of Arizona communities and migrants.” In a statement, she said she would “keep pushing for transparency and accountability from the administration to help secure the border, keep Arizona communities safe, and ensure migrants are treated fairly and humanely.”\n\nEarlier this month, she joined a bipartisan effort to prevent Title 42’s end until after the national public health emergency order ends. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., the lead Democratic cosponsor, filed the Public Health and Border Security Act of 2022. Joining him as Democratic cosponsors were Sinema and Sens. Joe Manchin from West Virginia, Jon Tester from Montana, and Maggie Hassan from New Hampshire.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jared Goldman, D-Maine, was the lead Democratic cosponsor of the companion bill in the House. Joining him were Democratic cosponsors, Reps. Tom O’Halleran and Greg Stanton of Arizona, Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and Tim Ryan of Ohio.\n\nThe bill isn’t likely to pass the House even if it were to pass the Senate.\n\nSo far, 22 states have sued to stop the administration from halting Title 42 in two separate lawsuits. Unless the Biden administration is stopped by the courts, DHS announced last month measures it was putting in place to prepare for up to 18,000 people a day expected to enter U.S. custody once Title 42 is lifted.\n\nThis estimate is in addition to the roughly 2 million people who were apprehended or encountered by Border Patrol agents in Biden’s first year in office while Title 42 was in place. All encounter numbers exclude “gotaways,” those who evade capture and don’t surrender at ports of entry.\n\nRepublished with the permission of The Center Square.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...', 'image': 'https://altoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Henry-cuellar-696x464.webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:27'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns.

The president has not done that. The president has committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any kind of "\n\nHagerty then reportedly cut Garland off to highlight recent instances in which the president\'s advisers defended Hunter Biden publicly.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain appeared on ABC\'s "This Week" program just two days after a federal grand jury reportedly heard testimony about Hunter Biden\'s cash flow, while serving on the board of Ukraine energy company Burisma. Klain said: "Of course the president\'s confident that his son didn\'t break the law."\n\nAlso, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged a media question Monday, inquiring about a New York Post report of a Hunter Biden business associate (Eric Schwerin, the former president of Hunter Biden\'s investment firm Rosemont Seneca) visiting the White House 19 separate times from 2009-13.\n\nThe potential relevance here: President Biden has previously stated he has "never spoken" to Hunter Biden, or any of his financial partners, about outside business deals.\n\nLater in the Senate hearing, Hagerty asked Garland whether Americans "can be confident that this administration is conducting a serious investigation."\n\nGarland answered in the affirmative, adding, "Because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters."\n\nEmails from Hunter Biden\'s laptop reportedly indicate Schwerin had access to Joe Biden\'s personal finances, including being involved with the elder Biden\'s taxes and discussing the then-vice president\'s financial future with him.\n\nIn 2019, the FBI seized control of a Hunter Biden laptop left in a Delaware-based repair shop. The contents of the laptop have yet to be released to the public, in full; but last month, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., successfully included the hard-drive components of Hunter Biden\'s captured laptop into the Congressional Record.\n\nThe current Hunter Biden probe has since been expanded to possible acts of money laundering and the violation of lobbying laws, according to reports. Last week, the Washington Post confirmed that in 2017 and 2018, Hunter Biden and the president\'s brother, James Biden, controlled $4.8 million in payments from a Chinese energy conglomerate.\n\nEarlier in April, a witness in the Hunter Biden grand jury proceedings was asked about Biden\'s deal with CEFC China Energy Co., along with the identity of "the big guy" during sworn testimony in Wilmington, Delaware, according to a New York Post report.\n\nCiting the Post report, a source familiar with the grand jury\'s work says the question had been posed after the witness was shown a piece of evidence, which included the cryptic query of "10 held by H for the big guy."\n\nThe line of grand-jury questioning follows up a separate New York Post report from October 2020, when James Gilliar, a former business partner to Hunter Biden, outlined the proposed percentage distribution of equity in a company that was created as a joint venture with CEFC China Energy Co.\n\nAt his 2020 impeachment trial, then-President Donald Trump\'s defense team cited Obama-era visitor logs that indicated Biden met with his son\'s business partner Devon Archer, April 16, 2014 — around the time Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he reportedly earned $1 million per year.\n\nAt the time, then-Vice President Joe Biden led U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\nCiting the New York Post report, documents and a photo indicated that Joe Biden attended a 2015 Washington, D.C., dinner with a group of his son\'s associates — including Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi and the Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.\n\nA Senate report from 2020 uncovered that, in 2014, Baturina paid $3.5 million to a firm linked to Hunter Biden.', 'image': 'https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=371c9975-705f-4593-a515-3d893c7330c3&SiteName=Newsmax', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:09'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:48'}

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,” McCarthy said. “And then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_mayorkasalejandro_042522gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:22'}

Seth Meyers took “A Closer Look” at why the GOP continues to embrace Trump even after more damning evidence emerges about the January 6 insurrection.\n\nLate Night with Seth Meyers has long been critical of Republicans and the conservative movement, even outside of the Trump presidency. Countless segments of “A Closer Look” have featured Meyers calling the GOP morally bankrupt and without any real policies.\n\nAny hope that things would change once Donald Trump left the White House has been dashed. Some Republicans in Congress continue to support Trump or parrot his claims about the election. Meanwhile, GOPers running for office remain desperate for Trump’s endorsement.\n\nFor Seth Meyers, this trend becomes harder to understand the more we learn about the events leading up to and immediately following the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Monday night’s “A Closer Look” examined how the GOP still revolves around Donald Trump.\n\nIn A Closer Look, Seth Meyers rips Ivanka Trump, David Perdue, and J.D. Vance\n\nSeth Meyers began “A Closer Look” by recapping a report on thousands of texts among Team Trump between the 2020 election and the January 6 insurrection. Meyers specifically focuses on texts from Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s daughter and adviser.\n\nMeyers compares Ivanka to a Peleton instructor in the way she called Trump’s inner circle “warriors” for their efforts to overturn the election. Even more confusing to Meyers is why Team Trump tried to plan a coup using a group chat.\n\nThat attempted coup is more than enough evidence for Meyers to argue Donald Trump won’t change. Yet Republicans still think “the path to power in their party requires fully embracing Donald Trump and his lies about the 2020 election,” according to “A Closer Look.”\n\nThe Late Night host points to Georgia gubernatorial candidate David Perdue and Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance. Meyers highlights Perdue’s willingness to repeat baseless claims about election fraud as well as how Vance backed off his criticism of Trump to get his endorsement.\n\nMeyers wraps up the segment by arguing that the GOP is being held captive by a cult led by Donald Trump.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz\n\nAttorney General Tight-Lipped on Hunter Biden Investigation\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers “there will not be interference,” but declined to say whether he has been briefed on the federal tax investigation into Hunter Biden by the U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware.\n\nGarland was questioned about the federal investigation into Biden by Sens. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:37'}

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge’s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called “this enormous threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac166314b8679c166f4e126f34de9b87e912373/0_296_5889_3533/master/5889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4c7c29ca50ead9e29c1693f5d2a70d2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015.

Sixty percent say Hunter Biden has sold “influence and access” to Joe Biden. The poll also shows 67 percent believe Joe Biden should be impeached if he “secretly participated and facilitated” in the family’s business.\n\nText messages from 2019 on Hunter’s “laptop from hell” depict the Biden family payout mechanism.

A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:55'}

Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number.\n\nAlready the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House.\n\nMonths ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug Paxlovid against COVID.=-19 from the manufacturer Pfizer is lying on a table. Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.”\n\nNow, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nJapan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill.\n\n“We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.”\n\nComplicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.\n\nLast month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.\n\nAdministration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.\n\nThe funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.\n\nModerna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses.\n\nEarlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.\n\nRepublicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.\n\nThere are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage.\n\nSuch a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.\n\nRepublicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.\n\nIt would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.\n\n___', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6267ba122300002bf413a7d4.jpeg?cache=WRFAs9cO4t&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

She received a seven-year sentence despite having no prior record.\n\nThe third individual being pardoned on Tuesday is Dexter Jackson, a 52-year-old from Georgia who was convicted in 2002 for facilitating the distribution of marijuana through his business.

She returned to Washington on Monday.\n\nHarris “will isolate and continue to work from the Vice President’s residence,” Kirsten Allen, her spokesperson, said in a statement. “The Vice President will return to the White House when she tests negative.”\n\nHarris had avoided catching the virus for months, despite close contacts testing positive. Jamal Simmons, her communications director, announced a positive result earlier this month; Harris’ husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, contracted the virus in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vice president’s positive tests could create governing concerns given that Harris is the first in line of presidential succession to Biden, 79. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:23'}

So, there you go. No, I’m just confirming that for you. It is true, as we’ve noted many times, it is possible the president could test positive. We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen,” Psaki said.\n\nShe added though that she thinks Biden would be able to continue his presidential duties if he were to test positive.\n\n“He has access to the best health care in the world, and we believe, because of all the precautions and steps we have taken that he would be able to continue his duties, as the vice president is as well as vice president,” she said.\n\nOfficials stress that he is vaccinated, and Psaki said last week last week that it wouldn’t be a failure of the precautions in place to protect Biden if he were to get the virus.\n\nPsaki on Tuesday told reporters not to expect updates to protocols, including masking protocols, within the White House in light of Harris’ positive test.\n\nShe noted there is a regular testing cadence for the president and vice president, as well as officials around them, and that there is social distancing in meetings and a number of aides choose to wear masks.\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/harriskamala_031522_ap_manuel_balce_ceneta.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:55'}

The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP.

He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Intelligence officials told Stefanik the question would be better answered by law enforcement.\n\nStefanik’s query, shared with The Associated Press by a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the classified meeting, reflects a widespread sentiment in the GOP that questions about the financial dealings of President Joe Biden’s son remain unanswered. And they say they intend to do something about it.\n\nAs Republicans prepare for a possible return to power amid rising hopes of winning the House and the Senate in the November elections, they are laying the groundwork to make Hunter Biden and his business dealings a central target of their investigative and oversight efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden’s memoir ‘Beautiful Things’ publishes in April\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staff have discussed analyzing specific messages and financial transactions found on the laptop and have also discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities involved in paying Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The conversations have been in the early stages but have included talks of bringing on Republican lawyers and former Justice Department officials to help lead the investigations, the people said.\n\nThe White House in turn is preparing to defend the Democratic president from any allegations of wrongdoing and make the case that Republicans are driven by opportunism. Democrats are likely to point out how Republicans did not seek investigations into President Donald Trump’s own business pursuits in Russia and China or into the foreign dealings of his children and son-in-law while they held key campaign or White House roles.\n\nIt all raises the possibility of a messy, politically explosive showdown between a GOP-controlled Congress and the White House, one that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nHunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”\n\nJoe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House declined to comment, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to an email.\n\nRepublican leaders see Hunter Biden as a unifying force that can bring together different factions of the GOP and potentially satiate those calling for more dramatic action. Some members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus have said the first order of business for a Republican majority should be an impeachment trial of Joe Biden in retaliation for the two impeachments of Trump.\n\nThere’s also increasing discussion among Republicans about urging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden says he’s facing federal investigation over ‘tax affairs’\n\n“Hunter Biden’s fair game because I believe Hunter Biden is a national security risk,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is in line to take over the House Oversight Committee if Republicans win the House. “Hopefully, when I get the gavel, we’ll take it a step further.”\n\nIn preparation, Comer’s oversight staff has already begun to make document requests and archived information related to the president’s son.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in October 2020 that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. The Kremlin had also interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee now want to probe the origins of a widely shared letter from 50 former intelligence officials released a week after the New York Post story. The letter claimed the laptop carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation” and suggested that “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”\n\nJoe Biden in the second presidential debate, responding to Trump’s reference to the “laptop from hell,” said “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant.” That statement went further than the letter, though it was immediately and widely reported as having labeled the laptop as disinformation. Trump and many Republicans accused Biden of invoking Russia to avoid scrutiny about his son.\n\nNo evidence has emerged since of any Russian connections to the laptop or the emails. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment of the 2020 election alleged that Russian leader Vladimir Putin authorized multiple efforts in support of Trump. Russian state media amplified “disparaging content” about Biden “including stories centered on his son,” the assessment said, which also alleges Putin had “purview” over the activities of a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, called allegations that the Russians were behind the laptop “absurd.” Stefanik in a statement said “any alleged attempt by the intelligence agencies or intelligence community leadership to portray the facts surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop as misinformation needs to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who in 2020 issued a report on Hunter Biden and his work on behalf of Ukraine gas company Burisma, recently made a presentation on the Senate floor laying out allegations they say the media have ignored but the Justice Department and Congress need to investigate.\n\n“The Biden administration has been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests,” Grassley said.\n\nFor now, the Biden administration and many top Democrats are not commenting publicly on Hunter Biden. But the White House has already reassigned communications staff to prepare to respond to GOP investigations of Hunter Biden and other likely targets, including the origins of the coronavirus and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDemocrats are expected to argue that Hunter Biden is ultimately a distraction to most voters concerned about domestic issues.

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do?

Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

The president has not done that. The president has committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any kind of "\n\nHagerty then reportedly cut Garland off to highlight recent instances in which the president\'s advisers defended Hunter Biden publicly.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain appeared on ABC\'s "This Week" program just two days after a federal grand jury reportedly heard testimony about Hunter Biden\'s cash flow, while serving on the board of Ukraine energy company Burisma. Klain said: "Of course the president\'s confident that his son didn\'t break the law."\n\nAlso, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged a media question Monday, inquiring about a New York Post report of a Hunter Biden business associate (Eric Schwerin, the former president of Hunter Biden\'s investment firm Rosemont Seneca) visiting the White House 19 separate times from 2009-13.\n\nThe potential relevance here: President Biden has previously stated he has "never spoken" to Hunter Biden, or any of his financial partners, about outside business deals.\n\nLater in the Senate hearing, Hagerty asked Garland whether Americans "can be confident that this administration is conducting a serious investigation."\n\nGarland answered in the affirmative, adding, "Because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters."\n\nEmails from Hunter Biden\'s laptop reportedly indicate Schwerin had access to Joe Biden\'s personal finances, including being involved with the elder Biden\'s taxes and discussing the then-vice president\'s financial future with him.\n\nIn 2019, the FBI seized control of a Hunter Biden laptop left in a Delaware-based repair shop. The contents of the laptop have yet to be released to the public, in full; but last month, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., successfully included the hard-drive components of Hunter Biden\'s captured laptop into the Congressional Record.\n\nThe current Hunter Biden probe has since been expanded to possible acts of money laundering and the violation of lobbying laws, according to reports. Last week, the Washington Post confirmed that in 2017 and 2018, Hunter Biden and the president\'s brother, James Biden, controlled $4.8 million in payments from a Chinese energy conglomerate.\n\nEarlier in April, a witness in the Hunter Biden grand jury proceedings was asked about Biden\'s deal with CEFC China Energy Co., along with the identity of "the big guy" during sworn testimony in Wilmington, Delaware, according to a New York Post report.\n\nCiting the Post report, a source familiar with the grand jury\'s work says the question had been posed after the witness was shown a piece of evidence, which included the cryptic query of "10 held by H for the big guy."\n\nThe line of grand-jury questioning follows up a separate New York Post report from October 2020, when James Gilliar, a former business partner to Hunter Biden, outlined the proposed percentage distribution of equity in a company that was created as a joint venture with CEFC China Energy Co.\n\nAt his 2020 impeachment trial, then-President Donald Trump\'s defense team cited Obama-era visitor logs that indicated Biden met with his son\'s business partner Devon Archer, April 16, 2014 — around the time Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he reportedly earned $1 million per year.\n\nAt the time, then-Vice President Joe Biden led U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\nCiting the New York Post report, documents and a photo indicated that Joe Biden attended a 2015 Washington, D.C., dinner with a group of his son\'s associates — including Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi and the Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.\n\nA Senate report from 2020 uncovered that, in 2014, Baturina paid $3.5 million to a firm linked to Hunter Biden.', 'image': 'https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=371c9975-705f-4593-a515-3d893c7330c3&SiteName=Newsmax', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:09'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

If they don\'t know whom to ask, the challenge is even greater. But an even worse error is to decide on an answer before even asking the question — and then refusing to hear any answers that don\'t confirm what they\'ve already decided.\n\nAmerica\'s political class, especially the pundits and commentators, are guilty of all of these errors (and many more) as they continue to willfully not understand the Age of Trump and how America arrived at this democracy crisis. The Republican-fascist movement is winning because so many people who are supposed to know better continue to view simple questions as puzzling and mysterious, and continue to ignore the obvious answers.\n\nMany such voices among the high priesthood of the church of the savvy and the other professional smart people have concluded that the Republican Party is in the midst of a "civil war" or is in "disarray" in the aftermath of Donald Trump\'s presidency. That\'s not true: The Republican Party is "evolving" just as other fascist and authoritarian movements have historically done, largely by purging those who disagree with the Great Leader and his vision.\n\nRELATED: Here\'s why Trump won\'t run in 2024 — and why the Trump cult ultimately can\'t win\n\nMany of the same voices also announce that Trump\'s hold on the Republican-fascist Party and movement is weakening because of diminished attendance at his rallies, or because of rumors and "revelations" about internal resistance surrounding Trump\'s coup plot of Jan. 6, 2021. Those are significant details and facts, but they do not override the basic reality that Trump continues to be the leader of the Republican Party and the larger neofascist movement. He received millions more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016, and until he decides otherwise he is the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nRepublican voters and right-leaning independents continue to view Trump and what he represents as the identity and brand name of today\'s Republican Party and "conservative" movement. Moreover, the 2024 election is more than two years away and traditional barometers of Trump\'s popularity cannot be seen as reliably predictive.\n\nMaybe the media\'s worst misreading is the claim that Trump led the Republican Party astray. In fact, he set it free — to follow its worst impulses.\n\nBut those questions pale compared to the grandest misreading of all: the claim that Trump and Trumpism led the Republican Party astray from its core values, and by doing so "sabotaged" it. Reality is quite different: Trump and his neofascist right-wing populist movement set modern-day Republican leaders and voters free to embrace their antisocial, anti-human, anti-democratic, reactionary, racist, sexist, plutocratic, theocratic, conspiracist, anti-intellectual and anti-rational values and beliefs. Trumpism was not suddenly born ex nihilo in 2015; it has been at least 30 years in the making.\n\nUltimately, what America\'s political class, the punditry and most of the mainstream news media refuse to understand is that Donald Trump is simultaneously a man, a symbol, and a cult-leader who embodies a form of freedom — specifically, the freedom to indulge in the worst aspects of human behavior and then to wallow in the chaos and pain and suffering that result. Like other forms of fascism, Trumpism is exhilarating for followers and believers; it gives their lives purpose, meaning and a sense of community, largely by inflicting pain for those designated as its enemies.\n\nIn a recent column at Salon, longtime White House reporter Brian Karem summarizes Trump\'s hold over his followers and their devotion to him:\n\nTrump has played it close to the vest as he has traveled across the country to a variety of rallies, pitching baubles and trinkets to dazzle and amaze those of simple minds and limited funds. Buy a hat. Buy a shirt. Buy an ornament. Buy an autographed picture. Buy anything Trump is selling — probably up to and including autographed underwear. Millions continue to support him by buying his cheap and tawdry knickknacks. It makes me wonder what these homes look like. "Come in. clean your feet on the Trump doormat, hang up your coat on the Trump coat rack. Have a seat and a complimentary beverage out of our Trump lemonade pitcher, poured lovingly into a Trump autographed mug." Meanwhile, you can take a look at a phone video shot by Donald Trump Jr. inviting you to visit a "top secret" rally with his father — and, gosh, even get a chance to meet Dad! What the hell is a top secret rally? Isn\'t that what the KKK used to do?\n\nThe following observation is no doubt a challenging concept for those still wedded to "normal politics" and other obsolescent ways of thinking: "Donald Trump" is of immense symbolic importance, but Donald Trump the human being barely even matters. As I detailed in an earlier essay for Salon, "Donald Trump is no longer a mere person. Indeed, to some extent the human being behind the Trump persona has become irrelevant." In other words, Trump is integral to the American neofascist project — but he is also disposable and can be replaced as the situation demands.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nIf the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. For too many people in America\'s political class and the news media, especially, the only lens available to interpret politics is through horserace-style coverage, centrism bias, outmoded notions of balance and fairness, questions about who has "coattails" and is piling up "endorsements," and of course the results of public opinion polls and focus groups. To acknowledge that these habits and tools no longer have the explanatory power they once did (not very long ago) would be an enormous psychological leap, approaching epistemic collapse.\n\nHere are three examples of how strongly Donald Trump\'s power endures, whatever the hope-peddlers, professional centrists and others among the commentariat would like us to believe:\n\n1. The Republican Party announced last week that it will no longer participate in the 2024 presidential debates hosted by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nDebates serve an important function in a democracy and as such have played a key role in many elections. They are especially important for helping low information, independent and relatively apolitical voters decide whom to support. Beyond that, participation in a debate signals a commitment to democratic norms and institutions. Debates also reaffirm a shared belief in the principle that truth exists outside of partisanship and ideology.\n\nFascists and other authoritarians reject such consensus values. By rejecting the presidential debates, and replacing them with some type of right-wing propaganda theater, the Republican Party is choosing to protect Donald Trump (or his successors) from public scrutiny. Paul Waldman of the Washington Post offered this context:\n\nThe Republican Party has just offered us a glimpse of the hell they\'re going to put us all through in 2024. What might appear to be a petty argument about the conditions under which general election debates will or won\'t be held is actually much more…. But it\'s also a sign that the Republican strategy will again feature chaotic, Trumpian whining that is meant to delegitimize the entire presidential campaign process from start to finish, culminating in an attempt to take back the White House by theft if the voters don\'t vote the "right" way. Let\'s remember that while Trump performed well in the 2016 primary debates when he was on stage with a collection of empty suits, he did poorly in every one of his debates with Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. By the fall of 2024, he\'ll be 78 years old; the idea that he\'ll be more disciplined and focused than he was in the past is far-fetched. Everything Americans dislike about him would be on vivid display in a debate, before the largest audience the candidates will have. If Republicans announce now, two-and-a-half years in advance, that they\'re refusing to participate in the debates, it could save them a last-minute act of cowardice. But the more important reason they\'re doing this is to reinforce the idea that every institution and practice associated with the presidential campaign must be considered corrupt and biased against Trump and therefore illegitimate, whether it\'s the news media, the debates, maybe even the weather — and especially the vote counting.\n\n2. Republicans are enthusiastically doing the bidding of Donald Trump and his fascist project.\n\nWe see this through growing support for the Jan. 6 coup attempt and the Capitol attack, the escalating assault on democracy and voting rights, the moral panic around "critical race theory"; anti-LGBTQ bigotry and related conspiracy theories, the campaign to roll back reproductive rights and freedoms, the assault on free speech and other fundamental civil and human rights, the war on reason and critical thinking, the Big Lie, and the support (covert or otherwise) for right-wing authoritarians such as Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán.\n\nThe embrace of racism and the attack on reproductive rights and LGBTQ equality are not "top-down" politics. Republican voters overwhelmingly embrace those views.\n\nThis is not a story of "top-down" politics, or elites otherwise imposing their values on a public. Republican voters overwhelmingly support these policies and the values they embody. Donald Trump is a gifted political entrepreneur; he understood that many tens of millions of Americans yearn for fascism or some other form of authoritarian rule.\n\n3. To this point, Republican leaders and candidates are still in thrall to Trump. They must prostrate themselves before him and seek his blessing as a pathway to power.\n\nIn a recent article for the New York Times, Shane Goldmacher details how Trump continues to rule the Republican Party and the larger neofascist movement from his Mar-a-Lago retreat:\n\nFor 15 months, a parade of supplicants — senators, governors, congressional leaders and Republican strivers of all stripes — have made the trek to pledge their loyalty and pitch their candidacies. Some have hired Mr. Trump\'s advisers, hoping to gain an edge in seeking his endorsement. Some have bought ads that ran only on Fox News in South Florida. Some bear gifts; others dish dirt. Almost everyone parrots his lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Working from a large wooden desk reminiscent of the one he used in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has transformed Mar-a-Lago\'s old bridal suite into a shadow G.O.P. headquarters, amassing more than $120 million — a war chest more than double that of the Republican National Committee itself. ... And while other past presidents have ceded the political stage, Mr. Trump has done the opposite, aggressively pursuing an agenda of vengeance against Republicans who have wronged him, endorsing more than 140 candidates nationwide and turning the 2022 primaries into a stress test of his continued sway. ... "Party leaders have never played the role that Trump is playing," said Roger Stone, an on-and-off adviser to Mr. Trump since the 1980s who has been spotted at Mar-a-Lago of late. "Because he can — and he\'s not bound by the conventional rules of politics."\n\nGoldmacher raises the question of whether Trump\'s "big public profile" will be "a potent turnoff for swing voters" in the fall election, which remains to be seen. But in Republican primaries, "few serious candidates are openly breaking" with him. Former Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn says Trump\'s conquest of the party "has been so complete ... that even the RINOs are attempting to talk MAGA."\n\n"Few see an expiration date" on Trump\'s dominance of the Republican Party, Goldmacher concludes, "until and unless he declines to run again in 2024 or is defeated." GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has reportedly told Trump, "We need you."\n\nIs that a portrait of a fascist leader whose power is in decline? With a war chest estimated at $120 million and a right-wing disinformation media machine largely at his command, at this moment Donald Trump is the Republican Party. The fact that some members of the political and media classes read Goldmacher\'s story as announcing the end of the Trump era only reflects the biased and distorted view of reality that led America to this ugly situation in the first place.\n\nAccording to traditional Christian theology, the devil\'s greatest trick was to convince the people of the world that he does not exist. Trump is perhaps only a lesser demon. But do not be fooled by the claim that he is no longer a threat. If America\'s political elites fall for that trick, it will likely mean the end of the country\'s democracy.\n\nRead more on our 45th president:', 'image': 'https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media.salon.com/2021/07/donald-trump-faded-american-flag-0718211.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:44'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:48'}

The two visits occurred in room 272 on Feb. 29 and room 276 on Aug. 17 at the Old Executive Office Building (OEOB), according to the 2016 White House visitor logs.\n\nRicchetti has been a longtime adviser to President Biden and served as his chief of staff from 2013 to 2017.

It is unclear if Biden was present for the meetings.\n\nPerson is not only a former assistant at Rosemont Seneca Partners, but she is also the sister of Francis "Fran" Person, a longtime Biden aide who left the White House a few months after she joined Biden\'s office in May 2014. He served as an advisor to Biden between 2009 and 2014, where he traveled to 49 of the 50 countries Biden visited, including China.

Schwerin met with John McGrail, who was a counselor to Biden, on July 15 and Sept. 9 at the White House. He also met with Kaitlyn Demers, who was serving as an associate counsel in Biden\'s office in 2016, on June 28.

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,” McCarthy said. “And then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_mayorkasalejandro_042522gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:22'}

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:37'}

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge’s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called “this enormous threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac166314b8679c166f4e126f34de9b87e912373/0_296_5889_3533/master/5889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4c7c29ca50ead9e29c1693f5d2a70d2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

And the Biden administration predicts roughly 12,000 migrants per day will begin crossing the border when Title 42 is lifted. Currently, about half of those migrants encountered are turned back across the border and prevented from seeking asylum. When Title 42 is lifted, immigrants will be allowed to live in the United States while they pursue asylum claims, a process that can take between two to four years.\n\nThe Biden administration says it plans to deport more migrants who do not pass the initial screening for asylum and is working with countries in the region to accept flights returning their citizens.\n\nOne country that has refused to accept back its emigrants is Cuba. Another senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday that talks between the U.S. and Cuba over immigration policy are “ongoing” and off to a “good start.”\n\nFamilies from El Salvador, Guatemala and El Salvador made up the majority of border crossers prior to the pandemic.

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015. Joe Biden was vice president during this time. The contact between Joe Biden and Schwerin directly contradicts Joe Biden’s repeated claims he was never involved in the family business. The Post’s reporting adds a twelfth instance Joe Biden has been involved in the family’s business scheme.\n\nDOOCY: "The President has said that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings.

Sixty percent say Hunter Biden has sold “influence and access” to Joe Biden. The poll also shows 67 percent believe Joe Biden should be impeached if he “secretly participated and facilitated” in the family’s business.\n\nText messages from 2019 on Hunter’s “laptop from hell” depict the Biden family payout mechanism.

But don’t worry, unlike Pop [Joe], I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\n\nThe Biden’s family payment mechanism of collecting 50 percent of family salaries for 30 years could be legal “predicates” for racketeering charges, according to former Utah U.S. attorney Brett Tolman.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter and Gettr @WendellHusebø.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about.

I\'m grateful to be both vaccinated and boosted," Harris tweeted.\n\nMr. Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday afternoon, and the president "wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home," according to the White House.\n\nThe vice president\'s positive diagnosis comes more than a month after her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nSeveral other members of the White House staff, including Harris\'s communications director Jamal Simmons and Jill Biden\'s press secretary Michael LaRosa, also received positive tests earlier this month, as did top Washington officials including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\nThe vice president was set to meet with Mr. Biden in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning to receive a daily intelligence briefing, though she did not participate in the meeting, her spokesperson said.\n\nA White House official told CBS News that Harris did go to the White House on Tuesday morning and was tested for the coronavirus in her West Wing office as part of her regular routine. Harris then left the White House in her motorcade after receiving a positive test.\n\nShe last saw the president on April 18, the day of the White House Easter Egg Roll, after which she departed for California, where she spent the week attending events. Harris returned to Washington on Monday from Los Angeles.\n\nIn addition to being first in the presidential line of succession, Harris also plays a crucial role in the 50-50 Senate, casting tie-breaking votes.\n\n"I think if you take a step back and look at the vice president, she is boosted, especially twice," White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told reporters Tuesday. "We have a very, very contagious variant out there. It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America. That\'s not even a policy goal."\n\nWhile the nation saw a steep drop in new coronavirus infections following a mid-January peak driven by the highly contagious Omicron, there has been a slight uptick in cases over the past few weeks due to the emergence of the new BA.2 sublineage of the Omicron variant.\n\nAs part of its efforts to protect Americans from the virus and bolster access to treatments, the White House announced Tuesday it is expanding availability of Paxlovid, an antiviral drug from Pfizer that can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19. First authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, the pills were in short supply, but delivery of the antiviral has since been accelerated.\n\nThe White House is also launching more "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can be tested and, if they are found to have the coronavirus, receive free oral antiviral pills in one visit.\n\nWeijia Jiang and Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/7006ff90-54ea-49ba-9d2c-4923af685a41/thumbnail/1200x630/cfc42b48f711d609ccb0cb2de59c8519/gettyimages-1240137772.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:38'}

No, I mean, come on! Freedom?!”\n\nThat post was reportedly moved for promoting “violence and incitement.”\n\n“MRC Free Speech America tallied 646 cases in its CensorTrack database of pro-Biden censorship. … The tally included cases from Biden’s presidential candidacy to the present day,” MRC said. “The worst cases of censorship involved platforms targeting anyone who dared to speak about any subject related to the New York Post bombshell Hunter Biden story.”\n\n“The Post investigated Hunter Biden and the Biden family’s allegedly corrupt foreign business dealings. Big Tech’s cancellation of that story helped shift the 2020 election in Biden’s favor,” it added.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted Facebook and Twitter for comment.\n\nIt comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Monday clinched a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion cash. Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, has criticized Twitter’s moderation.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said in a statement.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.download-72-1200x799.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:35'}

A comic book writer portrayed the pair as a superhero team in the 2016 book, The Adventures of Barry & Joe: Obama and Biden\'s Bromantic Battle for the Soul of America.\n\nObama refrained from endorsing Biden during his 2020 campaign until it became clear he would clinch the Democratic nomination. At the time, Biden claimed that "everyone knows I’m close with him" and "I don’t need an Obama endorsement," Politico reported.

Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number.\n\nAlready the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House.\n\nMonths ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug Paxlovid against COVID.=-19 from the manufacturer Pfizer is lying on a table. Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.”\n\nNow, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nJapan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill.\n\n“We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.”\n\nComplicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.\n\nLast month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.\n\nAdministration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.\n\nThe funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.\n\nModerna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses.\n\nEarlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.\n\nRepublicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.\n\nThere are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage.\n\nSuch a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.\n\nRepublicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.\n\nIt would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.\n\n___', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6267ba122300002bf413a7d4.jpeg?cache=WRFAs9cO4t&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

She received a seven-year sentence despite having no prior record.\n\nThe third individual being pardoned on Tuesday is Dexter Jackson, a 52-year-old from Georgia who was convicted in 2002 for facilitating the distribution of marijuana through his business.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings.

The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP.

She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House.

He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Intelligence officials told Stefanik the question would be better answered by law enforcement.\n\nStefanik’s query, shared with The Associated Press by a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the classified meeting, reflects a widespread sentiment in the GOP that questions about the financial dealings of President Joe Biden’s son remain unanswered. And they say they intend to do something about it.\n\nAs Republicans prepare for a possible return to power amid rising hopes of winning the House and the Senate in the November elections, they are laying the groundwork to make Hunter Biden and his business dealings a central target of their investigative and oversight efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden’s memoir ‘Beautiful Things’ publishes in April\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staff have discussed analyzing specific messages and financial transactions found on the laptop and have also discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities involved in paying Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The conversations have been in the early stages but have included talks of bringing on Republican lawyers and former Justice Department officials to help lead the investigations, the people said.\n\nThe White House in turn is preparing to defend the Democratic president from any allegations of wrongdoing and make the case that Republicans are driven by opportunism. Democrats are likely to point out how Republicans did not seek investigations into President Donald Trump’s own business pursuits in Russia and China or into the foreign dealings of his children and son-in-law while they held key campaign or White House roles.\n\nIt all raises the possibility of a messy, politically explosive showdown between a GOP-controlled Congress and the White House, one that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nHunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”\n\nJoe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House declined to comment, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to an email.\n\nRepublican leaders see Hunter Biden as a unifying force that can bring together different factions of the GOP and potentially satiate those calling for more dramatic action. Some members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus have said the first order of business for a Republican majority should be an impeachment trial of Joe Biden in retaliation for the two impeachments of Trump.\n\nThere’s also increasing discussion among Republicans about urging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden says he’s facing federal investigation over ‘tax affairs’\n\n“Hunter Biden’s fair game because I believe Hunter Biden is a national security risk,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is in line to take over the House Oversight Committee if Republicans win the House. “Hopefully, when I get the gavel, we’ll take it a step further.”\n\nIn preparation, Comer’s oversight staff has already begun to make document requests and archived information related to the president’s son.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in October 2020 that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. The Kremlin had also interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee now want to probe the origins of a widely shared letter from 50 former intelligence officials released a week after the New York Post story. The letter claimed the laptop carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation” and suggested that “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”\n\nJoe Biden in the second presidential debate, responding to Trump’s reference to the “laptop from hell,” said “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant.” That statement went further than the letter, though it was immediately and widely reported as having labeled the laptop as disinformation. Trump and many Republicans accused Biden of invoking Russia to avoid scrutiny about his son.\n\nNo evidence has emerged since of any Russian connections to the laptop or the emails. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment of the 2020 election alleged that Russian leader Vladimir Putin authorized multiple efforts in support of Trump. Russian state media amplified “disparaging content” about Biden “including stories centered on his son,” the assessment said, which also alleges Putin had “purview” over the activities of a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, called allegations that the Russians were behind the laptop “absurd.” Stefanik in a statement said “any alleged attempt by the intelligence agencies or intelligence community leadership to portray the facts surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop as misinformation needs to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who in 2020 issued a report on Hunter Biden and his work on behalf of Ukraine gas company Burisma, recently made a presentation on the Senate floor laying out allegations they say the media have ignored but the Justice Department and Congress need to investigate.\n\n“The Biden administration has been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests,” Grassley said.\n\nFor now, the Biden administration and many top Democrats are not commenting publicly on Hunter Biden. But the White House has already reassigned communications staff to prepare to respond to GOP investigations of Hunter Biden and other likely targets, including the origins of the coronavirus and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDemocrats are expected to argue that Hunter Biden is ultimately a distraction to most voters concerned about domestic issues. The current House Oversight chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, previewed that argument in a statement responding to Comer, her Republican counterpart.\n\nSaid Maloney: “I’d hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be more focused on delivering for the American people than on phony outrage.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2022/04/2022-04-18T164916Z_950030436_RC2RPT9FSFOE_RTRMADP_3_RELIGION-EASTER-WHITE-HOUSE-1024x682.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:57'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

Klain said: "Of course the president\'s confident that his son didn\'t break the law."\n\nAlso, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged a media question Monday, inquiring about a New York Post report of a Hunter Biden business associate (Eric Schwerin, the former president of Hunter Biden\'s investment firm Rosemont Seneca) visiting the White House 19 separate times from 2009-13.\n\nThe potential relevance here: President Biden has previously stated he has "never spoken" to Hunter Biden, or any of his financial partners, about outside business deals.\n\nLater in the Senate hearing, Hagerty asked Garland whether Americans "can be confident that this administration is conducting a serious investigation."\n\nGarland answered in the affirmative, adding, "Because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters."\n\nEmails from Hunter Biden\'s laptop reportedly indicate Schwerin had access to Joe Biden\'s personal finances, including being involved with the elder Biden\'s taxes and discussing the then-vice president\'s financial future with him.\n\nIn 2019, the FBI seized control of a Hunter Biden laptop left in a Delaware-based repair shop. The contents of the laptop have yet to be released to the public, in full; but last month, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., successfully included the hard-drive components of Hunter Biden\'s captured laptop into the Congressional Record.\n\nThe current Hunter Biden probe has since been expanded to possible acts of money laundering and the violation of lobbying laws, according to reports. Last week, the Washington Post confirmed that in 2017 and 2018, Hunter Biden and the president\'s brother, James Biden, controlled $4.8 million in payments from a Chinese energy conglomerate.\n\nEarlier in April, a witness in the Hunter Biden grand jury proceedings was asked about Biden\'s deal with CEFC China Energy Co., along with the identity of "the big guy" during sworn testimony in Wilmington, Delaware, according to a New York Post report.\n\nCiting the Post report, a source familiar with the grand jury\'s work says the question had been posed after the witness was shown a piece of evidence, which included the cryptic query of "10 held by H for the big guy."\n\nThe line of grand-jury questioning follows up a separate New York Post report from October 2020, when James Gilliar, a former business partner to Hunter Biden, outlined the proposed percentage distribution of equity in a company that was created as a joint venture with CEFC China Energy Co.\n\nAt his 2020 impeachment trial, then-President Donald Trump\'s defense team cited Obama-era visitor logs that indicated Biden met with his son\'s business partner Devon Archer, April 16, 2014 — around the time Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he reportedly earned $1 million per year.\n\nAt the time, then-Vice President Joe Biden led U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\nCiting the New York Post report, documents and a photo indicated that Joe Biden attended a 2015 Washington, D.C., dinner with a group of his son\'s associates — including Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi and the Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.\n\nA Senate report from 2020 uncovered that, in 2014, Baturina paid $3.5 million to a firm linked to Hunter Biden.', 'image': 'https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=371c9975-705f-4593-a515-3d893c7330c3&SiteName=Newsmax', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:09'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:48'}

In his own statement, Bennett warned Biden not to accede to Iranian demands to remove the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps from the U.S. designated terrorist list.

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42.

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at an April 26 Senate Committee on Appropriations hearing.\n\n“As I said during my nomination hearing, the investigation is being run by and supervised by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware. He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit.

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge’s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called “this enormous threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac166314b8679c166f4e126f34de9b87e912373/0_296_5889_3533/master/5889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4c7c29ca50ead9e29c1693f5d2a70d2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

Bill Hagerty (R-TN) asked Garland if he knew of the probe into the president’s son. Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation. Legal experts have said a special counsel is necessary because Joe Biden has denied any wrongdoing by Hunter and may have influenced the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The question of whether they have a special counsel is one that is an internal decision-making within the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland responded. “But I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s [Weiss] playing.”\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden claimed Hunter’s “laptop from hell” was a Russian plant “and a smear campaign.” Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved in the family business.\n\nJoe Biden said the emails on Hunter’s laptop were a “Russian plant” and “a smear campaign.” Today new emails indicate that Biden was PAYING Hunter’s bills for a deal with a Chinese government-controlled entity. pic.twitter.com/K3Ojf3SyIg — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) April 26, 2022\n\nBut according to White House visitor logs obtained by the New York Post on Saturday, Hunter’s corrupt business partner, Eric Schwerin, met with Joe Biden at the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42.

The two men were amicable in public, and White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed the pair "talk regularly" and that their kinship is not "a relationship of obligation."\n\nDuring the Obama years, many believed the presidential duo had a tight-knit relationship. A comic book writer portrayed the pair as a superhero team in the 2016 book, The Adventures of Barry & Joe: Obama and Biden\'s Bromantic Battle for the Soul of America.\n\nObama refrained from endorsing Biden during his 2020 campaign until it became clear he would clinch the Democratic nomination. At the time, Biden claimed that "everyone knows I’m close with him" and "I don’t need an Obama endorsement," Politico reported.

Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number.\n\nAlready the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House.\n\nMonths ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug Paxlovid against COVID.=-19 from the manufacturer Pfizer is lying on a table. Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.”\n\nNow, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nJapan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill.\n\n“We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.”\n\nComplicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.\n\nLast month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.\n\nAdministration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.\n\nThe funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.\n\nModerna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses.\n\nEarlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.\n\nRepublicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.\n\nThere are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage.\n\nSuch a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.\n\nRepublicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.\n\nIt would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.\n\n___', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6267ba122300002bf413a7d4.jpeg?cache=WRFAs9cO4t&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result.

The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:23'}

The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP.

'boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP,' according to a new book\n\nThe book also delves into President Joe Biden's governing woes – including prolonged talks with Sinema, whom the authors dub an 'aloof Arizonan.' She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House.

He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot.

But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man.'\n\nTrump took back his endorsement in the Alabama Senate primary, citing Brooks' call for people to put the 2020 election 'behind you.'\n\nLindell, who was advised Trump inside the White House in the last days of his presidency, has also repeatedly touted the idea.\n\nOther passages in the book reveal how Vice President Kamala Harris quickly learned not to come between President Biden and his negotiations with Congress.\n\nThe authors recount one episode where the president snapped at her so harshly even Republican senators in the meeting were shocked.\n\nIn a meeting last May, Biden tried to persuade Republican lawmakers to support $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nAnd while Biden was ready for a compromise, Harris thought the bill was skimpy.\n\n'Harris thought that there was something missing from the conversation,' according to the book.\n\nShe began turning the conversation toward Democratic priorities, including family and social spending, which were originally included in the larger Build Back Better bill.\n\nShe 'began to make the case for a larger package than the one Republicans seemed to have in mind.'\n\n'Biden dismissed her comment immediately,' the authors wrote, in so harsh a tone 'that even the Republican senators were taken aback.'\n\nBiden was typically 'scrupulously respectful' of his second-in-command, but the moment revealed that infrastructure negotiations were his and his alone.", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/17/57074033-0-image-a-35_1650989503049.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:39'}

Intelligence officials told Stefanik the question would be better answered by law enforcement.\n\nStefanik’s query, shared with The Associated Press by a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the classified meeting, reflects a widespread sentiment in the GOP that questions about the financial dealings of President Joe Biden’s son remain unanswered. And they say they intend to do something about it.\n\nAs Republicans prepare for a possible return to power amid rising hopes of winning the House and the Senate in the November elections, they are laying the groundwork to make Hunter Biden and his business dealings a central target of their investigative and oversight efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden’s memoir ‘Beautiful Things’ publishes in April\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staff have discussed analyzing specific messages and financial transactions found on the laptop and have also discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities involved in paying Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The conversations have been in the early stages but have included talks of bringing on Republican lawyers and former Justice Department officials to help lead the investigations, the people said.\n\nThe White House in turn is preparing to defend the Democratic president from any allegations of wrongdoing and make the case that Republicans are driven by opportunism. Democrats are likely to point out how Republicans did not seek investigations into President Donald Trump’s own business pursuits in Russia and China or into the foreign dealings of his children and son-in-law while they held key campaign or White House roles.\n\nIt all raises the possibility of a messy, politically explosive showdown between a GOP-controlled Congress and the White House, one that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nHunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”\n\nJoe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House declined to comment, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to an email.\n\nRepublican leaders see Hunter Biden as a unifying force that can bring together different factions of the GOP and potentially satiate those calling for more dramatic action. Some members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus have said the first order of business for a Republican majority should be an impeachment trial of Joe Biden in retaliation for the two impeachments of Trump.\n\nThere’s also increasing discussion among Republicans about urging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden says he’s facing federal investigation over ‘tax affairs’\n\n“Hunter Biden’s fair game because I believe Hunter Biden is a national security risk,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is in line to take over the House Oversight Committee if Republicans win the House. “Hopefully, when I get the gavel, we’ll take it a step further.”\n\nIn preparation, Comer’s oversight staff has already begun to make document requests and archived information related to the president’s son.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in October 2020 that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. The Kremlin had also interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee now want to probe the origins of a widely shared letter from 50 former intelligence officials released a week after the New York Post story. The letter claimed the laptop carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation” and suggested that “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”\n\nJoe Biden in the second presidential debate, responding to Trump’s reference to the “laptop from hell,” said “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant.” That statement went further than the letter, though it was immediately and widely reported as having labeled the laptop as disinformation. Trump and many Republicans accused Biden of invoking Russia to avoid scrutiny about his son.\n\nNo evidence has emerged since of any Russian connections to the laptop or the emails. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment of the 2020 election alleged that Russian leader Vladimir Putin authorized multiple efforts in support of Trump. Russian state media amplified “disparaging content” about Biden “including stories centered on his son,” the assessment said, which also alleges Putin had “purview” over the activities of a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, called allegations that the Russians were behind the laptop “absurd.” Stefanik in a statement said “any alleged attempt by the intelligence agencies or intelligence community leadership to portray the facts surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop as misinformation needs to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who in 2020 issued a report on Hunter Biden and his work on behalf of Ukraine gas company Burisma, recently made a presentation on the Senate floor laying out allegations they say the media have ignored but the Justice Department and Congress need to investigate.\n\n“The Biden administration has been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests,” Grassley said.\n\nFor now, the Biden administration and many top Democrats are not commenting publicly on Hunter Biden. But the White House has already reassigned communications staff to prepare to respond to GOP investigations of Hunter Biden and other likely targets, including the origins of the coronavirus and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDemocrats are expected to argue that Hunter Biden is ultimately a distraction to most voters concerned about domestic issues. The current House Oversight chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, previewed that argument in a statement responding to Comer, her Republican counterpart.\n\nSaid Maloney: “I’d hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be more focused on delivering for the American people than on phony outrage.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2022/04/2022-04-18T164916Z_950030436_RC2RPT9FSFOE_RTRMADP_3_RELIGION-EASTER-WHITE-HOUSE-1024x682.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:57'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

Klain said: "Of course the president\'s confident that his son didn\'t break the law."\n\nAlso, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged a media question Monday, inquiring about a New York Post report of a Hunter Biden business associate (Eric Schwerin, the former president of Hunter Biden\'s investment firm Rosemont Seneca) visiting the White House 19 separate times from 2009-13.\n\nThe potential relevance here: President Biden has previously stated he has "never spoken" to Hunter Biden, or any of his financial partners, about outside business deals.\n\nLater in the Senate hearing, Hagerty asked Garland whether Americans "can be confident that this administration is conducting a serious investigation."\n\nGarland answered in the affirmative, adding, "Because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters."\n\nEmails from Hunter Biden\'s laptop reportedly indicate Schwerin had access to Joe Biden\'s personal finances, including being involved with the elder Biden\'s taxes and discussing the then-vice president\'s financial future with him.\n\nIn 2019, the FBI seized control of a Hunter Biden laptop left in a Delaware-based repair shop. The contents of the laptop have yet to be released to the public, in full; but last month, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., successfully included the hard-drive components of Hunter Biden\'s captured laptop into the Congressional Record.\n\nThe current Hunter Biden probe has since been expanded to possible acts of money laundering and the violation of lobbying laws, according to reports. Last week, the Washington Post confirmed that in 2017 and 2018, Hunter Biden and the president\'s brother, James Biden, controlled $4.8 million in payments from a Chinese energy conglomerate.\n\nEarlier in April, a witness in the Hunter Biden grand jury proceedings was asked about Biden\'s deal with CEFC China Energy Co., along with the identity of "the big guy" during sworn testimony in Wilmington, Delaware, according to a New York Post report.\n\nCiting the Post report, a source familiar with the grand jury\'s work says the question had been posed after the witness was shown a piece of evidence, which included the cryptic query of "10 held by H for the big guy."\n\nThe line of grand-jury questioning follows up a separate New York Post report from October 2020, when James Gilliar, a former business partner to Hunter Biden, outlined the proposed percentage distribution of equity in a company that was created as a joint venture with CEFC China Energy Co.\n\nAt his 2020 impeachment trial, then-President Donald Trump\'s defense team cited Obama-era visitor logs that indicated Biden met with his son\'s business partner Devon Archer, April 16, 2014 — around the time Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he reportedly earned $1 million per year.\n\nAt the time, then-Vice President Joe Biden led U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\nCiting the New York Post report, documents and a photo indicated that Joe Biden attended a 2015 Washington, D.C., dinner with a group of his son\'s associates — including Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi and the Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.\n\nA Senate report from 2020 uncovered that, in 2014, Baturina paid $3.5 million to a firm linked to Hunter Biden.', 'image': 'https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=371c9975-705f-4593-a515-3d893c7330c3&SiteName=Newsmax', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:09'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

After months in short supply, federal officials say the medications are now more widely available, yet are being underused.\n\nAs part of the new effort, the federal government plans to allow thousands of more pharmacies to directly order highly effective COVID-19 treatments like Pfizer\'s Paxlovid antiviral pills, which can reduce the risk of becoming severely ill. They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:48'}

In his own statement, Bennett warned Biden not to accede to Iranian demands to remove the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps from the U.S. designated terrorist list.

Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) questioned Garland on the matter, pointing out that Joe Biden’s messengers, including White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, have said on national television that the president is confident his son, Hunter Biden, did nothing wrong.\n\n“The president’s already told his subordinates—clearly, these are people he can fire at will—that he and his family did nothing wrong. How can the American people be confident that his administration is conducting a serious investigation?” Hagerty asked.\n\n“Because we put the investigation in the hands of a Trump appointee, from the previous administration, who’s the United States attorney for the District of Delaware, and because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters,” Garland, a Biden appointee, responded.\n\nThe probe was first revealed by Hunter Biden in late 2020. He claimed that prosecutors were investigating his “tax affairs.”\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, later confirmed the investigation but has declined to share any details.\n\nA grand jury subpoena showed that prosecutors compelled banks to share financial records of Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James Biden. Additionally, the mother of one of Hunter Biden’s children has said she testified to authorities pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nHagerty pressed Garland on whether a special counsel is appropriate, considering the public comments by Klain and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.\n\n“There’s an obvious conflict of interest here. Because those who are investigating the Biden family and their enterprise can be fired by the head of the family who is being investigated,” Hagerty said.\n\nGarland declined to say whether the department has or is considering appointing a special counsel, though he noted that special counsels are also employees of the Department of Justice.\n\nHe also would not answer when asked if he agreed with the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating allegations of collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.\n\n“The question of whether to have a special counsel is one that is internal decision-making in the department, so I don’t want to make any judgments one way or the other,” Garland told Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) later in the hearing. “I’m quite comfortable with the United States attorney for that district continuing in the role that he’s playing.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/26/garland-before-senate-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:35'}

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,” McCarthy said. “And then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_mayorkasalejandro_042522gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:22'}

He [David Weiss] is supervising the investigation, and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal DOJ deliberations—but he is in charge of that investigation, and there will not be interference of any political or improper kind,” Garland said, also declining to comment on whether other senior DOJ officials have been briefed.\n\nHagerty expressed skepticism at Garland’s promise, given recent statements from the White House regarding Hunter Biden’s innocence.\n\n“I wonder why the president is resorting to go to TV and … his surrogates. Earlier this month, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on TV that the president is confident that his son didn’t break the law, and the White House communications director said President Biden maintains his position that his son did nothing that was unethical,” Hagerty said.\n\nThe senator asked Garland whether U.S. President Joe Biden had told him his son is innocent.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Garland responded. “He has not done that, and he has committed to not interfere in the investigation.”\n\nHagerty pressed further, asking Garland how the public could be confident there won’t be political interference in the investigation.\n\n“Because we put a Trump appointee in charge of the investigation,” Garland said, referring to Weiss. “And because you have me as attorney general, who’s committed to the independence of the DOJ from any influence from the White House.”\n\nHagerty then asked Garland whether the DOJ was considering assigning a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. Garland again declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked under what circumstances a special counsel would be used in the investigation, Garland said, “it depends on the circumstances.”\n\nBraun asked similar questions about a potential special counsel and received similar responses.\n\n“The question is an internal DOJ matter,” Garland repeated. “I don’t want to make judgments, but I’m comfortable with the Attorney from Delaware continuing.”\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances was revealed in December 2020, and few updates have been provided since then.\n\nAttorney Clint Lancaster, who represented an Arkansas woman who filed the lawsuit in 2019 alleging that Hunter Biden was the father of her daughter Navy Joan Roberts, told CBS News earlier this month that federal prosecutors subpoenaed the documents from his case.\n\n“They wanted every record relating to Hunter Biden we had,” he said of the paternity case, which was settled in 2020.\n\nLancaster said the records included Hunter Biden’s “affidavit of financial means” during the paternity lawsuit. A financial affidavit is generally a statement showing income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, he said the tax records he and Roberts provided overlapped during the same time period as Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI3510J-FILEDIMAGE-1200x833.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:37'}

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge’s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called “this enormous threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac166314b8679c166f4e126f34de9b87e912373/0_296_5889_3533/master/5889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4c7c29ca50ead9e29c1693f5d2a70d2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

Garland refused to reveal any internal deliberations against Hunter but noted the investigation is being run by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWeiss, a 20-year federal prosecutor, will have to determine if there is enough evidence to seek a federal grand jury indictment against Hunter Biden in an investigation that may end up including other members of the Biden family, such as Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and potentially the president himself.\n\n“I’m aware of that, but he reports to you,” Hagerty pressed about the investigation under Weiss.\n\n“He is supervising the investigation and I’m not at liberty to talk about internal Justice Department deliberations, but he is in charge of that investigation,” Garland reiterated.\n\nGarland then promised the Biden administration would not interfere in the investigation. “There will not be interference of any political or improper kind.”\n\nHagerty continued his line of questioning by asking if Joe Biden ever told Garland that Hunter did not break any laws, including tax fraud, money laundering, and violation of lobbying laws.\n\n“Absolutely not. And the President has not done that. And the President is committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any other kind of investigation,” Garland claimed.\n\nLater in the hearing, Garland refused to say whether a special counsel should be placed over the investigation to maintain a just investigation. A special counsel would provide a degree of separation between Biden’s administration and the investigation.

Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) told reporters following the meeting.\n\n“We are in a different position now than we were in the past,” he said. “There’s ample vaccines available. There is the ability to test and quarantine that work. And so, Title 42 should be lifted, and that we should focus on border management policy in order to make sure that they have the resources in order to move forward.”\n\nBut the administration’s plans to stop enforcing Title 42 were thrown into doubt as the meeting came to a close. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana said he planned to block the administration’s plans for rescinding the public health order, a win for a group of GOP-led states who sued to stop Biden from moving forward.\n\nThe meeting punctuated internal disagreement in the Democratic Party around the Biden administration’s decision to end enforcement of the Title 42 authority, a public health order that allows border officials to speedily turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border.\n\nImmigration advocates have a litany of concerns about the policy, but at the center of those issues is that it allows officials to forego asylum screenings, blocking persecuted migrants from exercising a right they have under U.S. law.\n\nWhile many support the Biden administration’s decision and indeed wish it had come sooner, others have expressed concern about the plans amid a prolonged spike in border crossings.\n\n“Yes they’re listening to the immigration activists, but my question is who’s listening to the men and women in green and in blue and, more importantly, who is listening to the border communities – the sheriffs, the landowners, the rest of the people who live on the border?” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who represents a border community and has raised concerns about the policy decision, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), who was tasked with presenting the group’s position on Title 42 to Biden, said the meeting touched on a series of issues before turning to immigration, an issue that still led coverage of the meeting.\n\n“The reality is when you talk to Latinos they’re talking about the economy, jobs, air pollution, and so the media is talking about things that are divisive,” said Barragán.\n\nBarragán added that the CHC puts more blame over the immigration policy crisis on former President Trump than on Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is this president walked into a tough situation with a prior administration who dismantled the legal immigration system,” she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the meeting was part of Biden’s outreach to individual congressional caucuses. Biden has recently met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as well as other groups in Congress.\n\nAttendees said that it also covered the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, immigration reform, and environmental justice.\n\nAt one point, an aide to the president walked into the room with a note saying the 30-minute meeting had gone on for 62 minutes.\n\nBiden, rather than keep the information to himself, read the note out loud to laughter from the attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is facing pressure from immigration advocates to forcefully oppose a bill that has attracted support from moderate senators that would delay an end to the enforcement of Title 42. The White House has not taken a position on the legislation.\n\n“I just wish that the Biden administration would stand up and explain what it’s doing and own it,” said Clara Long, associate director at Human Rights Watch who focuses on immigration and border policy.\n\nPsaki again on Monday said it would be up to Congress to make any changes to CDC’s Title 42 enforcement, but she declined to say whether Biden would sign legislation that did so.\n\n“This would be Congress having the discussion. We are continuing to prepare for a May 23 implementation,” Psaki said. “There will be a range of conversations about this over the coming days.”\n\nThe lawsuits filed by GOP-led states seem to be the biggest immediate threat to the administration’s plans. Some have speculated that the White House would like to see the courts thwart their plans in order to take a hot-button political issue off Biden’s plate.\n\n“I think there’s a theory going around that they’re hoping the courts give them a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Long.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings are particularly low on his handling of immigration.\n\nA Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month found that 54 percent of registered voters oppose Biden’s decision to lift Title 42.\n\nBut a different poll conducted in February by Impact Research for the National Immigration Law Center found that 52 percent of likely 2022 voters support ending Title 42 enforcement.\n\nStill, most CHC members believe that the administration can push forward with its vision of border policy, because Republicans are unlikely to relent from attacking Biden on immigration and the border.\n\n“No matter what the president does, they’re going to make noise. The president and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done amazing things, that’s why econ has improved,” said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\n“Republicans don’t want to focus on the glass that’s half full, they want to convince us the glass is half empty,” he added.\n\nSome advocates for ending the policy, which they say represented one prong of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, argue that Democrats are risking turning off their base by voicing support for continuing the policy.\n\n“This is a policy that can help you win and the flipside of that is embracing the Republican talking points is not going to help you win those Democratic voters that you desperately need to turn out for you in November,” said Bri Gillis, political director of the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\nStill, some Democrats say the discussion of Title 42 is moot.\n\n“There’s nothing to debate, you’re either for Title 42 or you’re not,” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), a CHC member who did not attend the meeting.\n\n“Everybody’s talking abt Title 42 when that’s not the issue. The real issue is American industrial might, nearshoring of American jobs from China, creating a stronger manufacturing base, and a lot of that relies on immigrants. And we’re talking about Title 42. Doesn’t even come close to addressing the bigger public policy issues in this country and that’s what everybody’s talking about. And it’s hurting us,” said Correa.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/ruizraul_031821gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:55'}

Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn’t act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number.\n\nAlready the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can’t yet commit to, according to the White House.\n\nMonths ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called “urgent” needs in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Senate last month closed in on smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug Paxlovid against COVID.=-19 from the manufacturer Pfizer is lying on a table. Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nPaxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year.\n\nThe U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as “Operation Warp Speed.”\n\nNow, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind.\n\nJapan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi’s upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer’s treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill.\n\n“We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.”\n\nComplicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year.\n\nLast month the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer.\n\nAdministration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements.\n\nThe funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant.\n\nModerna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call “bivalent” shots — a mix of each company’s original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version — with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn’t have the money to order the new generation of doses.\n\nEarlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses.\n\nRepublicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules’ termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once.\n\nThere are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage.\n\nSuch a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt.\n\nRepublicans haven’t said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.\n\nIt would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.\n\n___', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6267ba122300002bf413a7d4.jpeg?cache=WRFAs9cO4t&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

Jamal Simmons, her communications director, announced a positive result earlier this month; Harris’ husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, contracted the virus in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vice president’s positive tests could create governing concerns given that Harris is the first in line of presidential succession to Biden, 79. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), second in line, announced a positive test earlier this month.\n\nHarris, 57, has been vaccinated and boosted twice. The shots greatly diminish the chances of her becoming seriously ill. When former President Trump, 75, was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020, he was at much higher risk, given his age and the lack of available vaccines. Trump has said he has since been vaccinated and boosted.\n\nWhite House officials have said that they expect Biden will catch the virus, but he has not been avoiding events with crowds. He is scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents Assn. dinner Saturday and to speak at a memorial service Sunday for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\n“Like many Americans, he makes risk assessments,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.\n\nHarris had initially planned to return to Washington from California, where she took some personal time and gave a speech about anti-satellite missiles and another about maternal health, on Tuesday. Her office would not say why she altered her travel plans to return a day earlier but noted that she was not experiencing any symptoms before testing positive.\n\nBecause she had not been expected in Washington until Tuesday, Harris had a light schedule, with no meetings in the morning and no public events all day, said Allen, the spokeswoman.\n\nHarris took a rapid antigen test Tuesday morning after going to work at the White House, Allen said. After that test came back positive, Allen said, Harris took a PCR test, a more accurate assessment that confirmed the rapid result. Harris left the White House for her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory by motorcade.\n\nBiden and Harris later spoke by phone. “He wanted to check in and make sure she has everything she needs as she quarantines at home,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThough Harris did not attend any formal meetings, the White House is still tracing her contacts to determine who may have been exposed to her. Even when they are not in formal meetings, vice presidents interact with an array of policy, communications and personal staff.\n\n“Should we identify a close a close contact, we will notify them as appropriate,” Allen said.\n\nHer office is also going through her schedule to see which public events and private meetings need to be canceled or shifted to a virtual setting.\n\nHarris plans to work from her residence for at least five days and will not return to the White House until she receives a negative test. Allen declined to say whether Harris would be taking any medication, adding that such decisions would be left to White House physicians.\n\nThe latest wave of COVID, sparked by the Omicron BA. 2 subvariants, has swept through official Washington in recent weeks, infecting many members of Congress and the executive branch. The White House rhetoric has shifted from preventing infections to promoting vaccines, boosters and therapeutics.\n\n“It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Tuesday. “That’s not even a policy. The goal of our policy should be obviously to minimize infections whenever possible, but to make sure people don’t get seriously ill. The best ways of doing that are make sure people are vaccinated and boosted as the vice president is and making sure we have plenty of therapeutics.”\n\nMinutes after Harris announced her result, two Democratic members of the Senate — Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — announced they too had contracted what they believed to be mild forms of the virus.\n\n“It’s a bummer, but I’m sure if I wasn’t fully vaccinated I would be feeling a lot worse. So remember to get your booster!” Murphy tweeted.\n\nSimmons, Harris’ communications director, tested positive for the virus after attending the April 2 Gridiron dinner, a traditional white-tie gathering of reporters and politicians that features light roasts and songs.\n\nAtty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of Commerce, announced positive test results following the dinner, as did Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nAll of them had been vaccinated, and none became seriously ill.\n\nHarris’ positive tests come as the administration has tried to push the country toward normalcy, eliminating mask requirements in many settings and returning to public gatherings. A federal judge in Florida took it a step further last week, overturning a federal requirement to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses. The administration is appealing that ruling.\n\n“None of us can predict with any certainty where exactly this pandemic is going, what the virus is going to do next. All we can do is prepare,” Jha said, urging Congress to pass another round of funding to combat the virus.\n\nStaff writer Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab3b3ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fff%2Fcfc38a794c329c2a8d3684ababb9%2F947026-na-pol-0421-vp-cali-trip-kkn-25884.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:23'}

He tested positive on March 15, which lead to a flurry of questions over Harris’s contact and if she should be wearing a mask around the president and others. She continued to test negative during Emhoff’s stint with the coronavirus.\n\nTwo Democratic senators also tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday: Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.).\n\nEarlier this month, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had the coronavirus, as did Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nThe White House recently first acknowledged that Biden could get COVID-19 amid the uptick in positive cases surrounding the president earlier this month.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it’s just a matter of time, but I of course it is possible that the president, like every other American, could get COVID,” Jha said on Tuesday. “There is no 100 percent anything.”\n\nPsaki was asked to respond to a hypothetical question about the line of succession if Biden were to also get COVID-19 and both he and Harris become “very ill.”\n\n“Well, technically the Speaker of the House is the third in line. So, there you go. No, I’m just confirming that for you. It is true, as we’ve noted many times, it is possible the president could test positive. We will be very transparent with you if that were to happen,” Psaki said.\n\nShe added though that she thinks Biden would be able to continue his presidential duties if he were to test positive.\n\n“He has access to the best health care in the world, and we believe, because of all the precautions and steps we have taken that he would be able to continue his duties, as the vice president is as well as vice president,” she said.\n\nOfficials stress that he is vaccinated, and Psaki said last week last week that it wouldn’t be a failure of the precautions in place to protect Biden if he were to get the virus.\n\nPsaki on Tuesday told reporters not to expect updates to protocols, including masking protocols, within the White House in light of Harris’ positive test.\n\nShe noted there is a regular testing cadence for the president and vice president, as well as officials around them, and that there is social distancing in meetings and a number of aides choose to wear masks.\n\nUpdated at 4:09 p.m.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/harriskamala_031522_ap_manuel_balce_ceneta.jpeg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:55'}

Kyrsten Sinema has confounded Democrats over budget talks – even while boasting about using her cleavage to reel in 'uptight' Republicans, according to a new book.\n\nSinema, a weight-lifter and fitness buff, regularly draws attention in the buttoned-down Senate hallways with her eclectic fashion choices.\n\nBut she has also developed ways to contend with Republicans in the minority, according to This Will Not Pass, a new book by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns.\n\nDespite being more 'discomfiting' to the White House than any Democrat in the 50-50 Senate, Sinema had relationships across the political aisle. The former House member, who is the first bisexual member of the Senate, 'joked with Democrats about how easy it was for her to charm Republican men,' according to the book.\n\n'Sinema, a fitness enthusiast who was 36 when she entered Congress, boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP. She told one House Republican that while she would never switch parties, her father would be delighted if she did,' the authors write.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) 'boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP,' according to a new book\n\nThe book also delves into President Joe Biden's governing woes – including prolonged talks with Sinema, whom the authors dub an 'aloof Arizonan.' She became a progressive nemesis when she and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wouldn't go along with Biden's multi-trillion proposals, although she did cheer his infrastructure plan.\n\nAfter Biden signed the infrastructure bill, Sinema asked Biden's aides not to send the president to her home state for a 'victory lap,' even though he had won Arizona in 2020. White House aides were concluding she was 'simply a difficult person.'\n\nThe book describes one early 2021 dinner with Senate Republicans after the election where where the Republicans asked Sinema to join – and she requested to be able to enter through a back door to avoid being seen.\n\nShe has won praise from Republicans for her opposition to changing the Senate filibuster, and a line of Republicans congratulated her on the Senate floor after voting with the GOP on a move to advance the Democratic leadership backed voting rights legislation.\n\nThe book, which grabbed headlines with revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also contains details about former President Donald Trump and his election overturn effort.\n\nSinema confounded Democrats during months-long negotiations\n\nSinema previously served in the House.

He had called the Capitol riot in a Jan. 6th column a 'disgrace,' where he wrote that 'one point of the riot was to further pressure Pence (“Hang Mike Pence!”), but much of the lobbying took place behind closed doors, among Trump’s advisers.')\n\nTrump also took a shot at now Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'It was beyond belief, Trump said, that Mitch McConnell did not seem to understand this,' according to the book.\n\n'The president's comments were pure madness,' the authors write.\n\nCongress ultimately counted the votes certified by the states following the Capitol riot.

Intelligence officials told Stefanik the question would be better answered by law enforcement.\n\nStefanik’s query, shared with The Associated Press by a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the classified meeting, reflects a widespread sentiment in the GOP that questions about the financial dealings of President Joe Biden’s son remain unanswered. And they say they intend to do something about it.\n\nAs Republicans prepare for a possible return to power amid rising hopes of winning the House and the Senate in the November elections, they are laying the groundwork to make Hunter Biden and his business dealings a central target of their investigative and oversight efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden’s memoir ‘Beautiful Things’ publishes in April\n\nRepublican lawmakers and staff have discussed analyzing specific messages and financial transactions found on the laptop and have also discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities involved in paying Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The conversations have been in the early stages but have included talks of bringing on Republican lawyers and former Justice Department officials to help lead the investigations, the people said.\n\nThe White House in turn is preparing to defend the Democratic president from any allegations of wrongdoing and make the case that Republicans are driven by opportunism. Democrats are likely to point out how Republicans did not seek investigations into President Donald Trump’s own business pursuits in Russia and China or into the foreign dealings of his children and son-in-law while they held key campaign or White House roles.\n\nIt all raises the possibility of a messy, politically explosive showdown between a GOP-controlled Congress and the White House, one that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nHunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, Hunter Biden’s membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”\n\nJoe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House declined to comment, and a lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to an email.\n\nRepublican leaders see Hunter Biden as a unifying force that can bring together different factions of the GOP and potentially satiate those calling for more dramatic action. Some members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus have said the first order of business for a Republican majority should be an impeachment trial of Joe Biden in retaliation for the two impeachments of Trump.\n\nThere’s also increasing discussion among Republicans about urging the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD MORE: Hunter Biden says he’s facing federal investigation over ‘tax affairs’\n\n“Hunter Biden’s fair game because I believe Hunter Biden is a national security risk,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is in line to take over the House Oversight Committee if Republicans win the House. “Hopefully, when I get the gavel, we’ll take it a step further.”\n\nIn preparation, Comer’s oversight staff has already begun to make document requests and archived information related to the president’s son.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in October 2020 that it had received from Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a copy of a hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved.\n\nThe story was greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop’s origins, including Giuliani’s involvement, and because top officials in the Trump administration had already warned that Russia was working to denigrate Joe Biden ahead of the November election. The Kremlin had also interfered in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic emails that were subsequently leaked.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee now want to probe the origins of a widely shared letter from 50 former intelligence officials released a week after the New York Post story. The letter claimed the laptop carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation” and suggested that “the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.”\n\nJoe Biden in the second presidential debate, responding to Trump’s reference to the “laptop from hell,” said “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant.” That statement went further than the letter, though it was immediately and widely reported as having labeled the laptop as disinformation. Trump and many Republicans accused Biden of invoking Russia to avoid scrutiny about his son.\n\nNo evidence has emerged since of any Russian connections to the laptop or the emails. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment of the 2020 election alleged that Russian leader Vladimir Putin authorized multiple efforts in support of Trump. Russian state media amplified “disparaging content” about Biden “including stories centered on his son,” the assessment said, which also alleges Putin had “purview” over the activities of a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, called allegations that the Russians were behind the laptop “absurd.” Stefanik in a statement said “any alleged attempt by the intelligence agencies or intelligence community leadership to portray the facts surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop as misinformation needs to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who in 2020 issued a report on Hunter Biden and his work on behalf of Ukraine gas company Burisma, recently made a presentation on the Senate floor laying out allegations they say the media have ignored but the Justice Department and Congress need to investigate.\n\n“The Biden administration has been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests,” Grassley said.\n\nFor now, the Biden administration and many top Democrats are not commenting publicly on Hunter Biden. But the White House has already reassigned communications staff to prepare to respond to GOP investigations of Hunter Biden and other likely targets, including the origins of the coronavirus and the American withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nDemocrats are expected to argue that Hunter Biden is ultimately a distraction to most voters concerned about domestic issues.

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do?

Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

The president has not done that. The president has committed not to interfere, not only in that investigation but any kind of "\n\nHagerty then reportedly cut Garland off to highlight recent instances in which the president\'s advisers defended Hunter Biden publicly.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain appeared on ABC\'s "This Week" program just two days after a federal grand jury reportedly heard testimony about Hunter Biden\'s cash flow, while serving on the board of Ukraine energy company Burisma. Klain said: "Of course the president\'s confident that his son didn\'t break the law."\n\nAlso, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged a media question Monday, inquiring about a New York Post report of a Hunter Biden business associate (Eric Schwerin, the former president of Hunter Biden\'s investment firm Rosemont Seneca) visiting the White House 19 separate times from 2009-13.\n\nThe potential relevance here: President Biden has previously stated he has "never spoken" to Hunter Biden, or any of his financial partners, about outside business deals.\n\nLater in the Senate hearing, Hagerty asked Garland whether Americans "can be confident that this administration is conducting a serious investigation."\n\nGarland answered in the affirmative, adding, "Because you have me as the attorney general, who is committed to the independence of the Justice Department from any influence from the White House in criminal matters."\n\nEmails from Hunter Biden\'s laptop reportedly indicate Schwerin had access to Joe Biden\'s personal finances, including being involved with the elder Biden\'s taxes and discussing the then-vice president\'s financial future with him.\n\nIn 2019, the FBI seized control of a Hunter Biden laptop left in a Delaware-based repair shop. The contents of the laptop have yet to be released to the public, in full; but last month, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., successfully included the hard-drive components of Hunter Biden\'s captured laptop into the Congressional Record.\n\nThe current Hunter Biden probe has since been expanded to possible acts of money laundering and the violation of lobbying laws, according to reports. Last week, the Washington Post confirmed that in 2017 and 2018, Hunter Biden and the president\'s brother, James Biden, controlled $4.8 million in payments from a Chinese energy conglomerate.\n\nEarlier in April, a witness in the Hunter Biden grand jury proceedings was asked about Biden\'s deal with CEFC China Energy Co., along with the identity of "the big guy" during sworn testimony in Wilmington, Delaware, according to a New York Post report.\n\nCiting the Post report, a source familiar with the grand jury\'s work says the question had been posed after the witness was shown a piece of evidence, which included the cryptic query of "10 held by H for the big guy."\n\nThe line of grand-jury questioning follows up a separate New York Post report from October 2020, when James Gilliar, a former business partner to Hunter Biden, outlined the proposed percentage distribution of equity in a company that was created as a joint venture with CEFC China Energy Co.\n\nAt his 2020 impeachment trial, then-President Donald Trump\'s defense team cited Obama-era visitor logs that indicated Biden met with his son\'s business partner Devon Archer, April 16, 2014 — around the time Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he reportedly earned $1 million per year.\n\nAt the time, then-Vice President Joe Biden led U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\nCiting the New York Post report, documents and a photo indicated that Joe Biden attended a 2015 Washington, D.C., dinner with a group of his son\'s associates — including Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi and the Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.\n\nA Senate report from 2020 uncovered that, in 2014, Baturina paid $3.5 million to a firm linked to Hunter Biden.', 'image': 'https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=371c9975-705f-4593-a515-3d893c7330c3&SiteName=Newsmax', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:09'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

They also plan to launch additional "test-to-treat" sites, where Americans can get diagnosed and receive the pills in a single visit.\n\nPaxlovid was first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in December, and supplies were hard to come by at first. Now the pills are no longer scarce, but they still aren\'t getting to everyone who might benefit from treatment.\n\n"It\'s pretty clear from the uptake of Paxlovid, and the rate of hospitalizations and deaths over the months that Paxlovid has been available, that there are still some folks who could have benefited from these medications," an administration official told reporters on Monday in a briefing to preview the announcement.\n\nFederal officials have voiced concerns publicly for weeks that treatments like Paxlovid, Merck and Ridgeback\'s Lagevrio antiviral pills, and Eli Lilly\'s bebtelovimab monoclonal antibody drug were not reaching enough Americans.\n\nOfficials said Monday that reported use of the antiviral pills has more than doubled over the past month, from 22,000 courses a week to over 55,000. That comes as cases and hospitalizations have begun to climb nationwide, driven by the highly-contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant.\n\nIn New England, federal data has tracked the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations surging among patients 70 and older — the age group most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 — since the beginning of April. The rate of new admissions is now higher than the peak reached over the Delta variant wave last year, but remains a fraction of the record highs during the winter Omicron wave.\n\n"We certainly know that there\'s more room to go. We can save more lives by giving this medication to more people," said the official.\n\nGetting Paxlovid antiviral pills\n\nPaxlovid treatment needs to begin within a few days of first developing symptoms.\n\nA course of treatment is made up of three tablets that are taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, over the course of five days, for a total of 30 pills. Initial clinical trials showed the drug reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 88%, compared to placebo.\n\nPaxlovid cannot be taken at the same time as several medications that can reduce the drug\'s efficacy or lead to potentially fatal side effects.\n\nThrough outreach to doctors and patients, officials say they hope more eligible Americans will act quickly to get the now-plentiful antiviral pills sitting on pharmacy shelves.\n\nPfizer\'s COVID-19 drug Paxlovid Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n"A lot of providers early on in that scarcity mindset, when there were fewer courses available across the country, were really reserving this for only the folks who they thought would be the sickest of the sick," an administration official told reporters.\n\nOn Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert urging doctors to step up prescribing of effective COVID-19 treatments — and imploring at-risk patients who test positive not to delay in contacting their doctors, "even if your symptoms are mild."\n\nA "tranche" of more than 100,000 courses of the antiviral pills will be made available to all of the federal government\'s pharmacy partners to order directly, instead of through federal and local allocations. Officials say they expect the move will raise the number of sites with drugs in stock from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nThat comes on top of efforts like the administration\'s nationwide "test-to-treat initiative" launched at thousands of pharmacies earlier this year.\n\nFollowing concerns that the program was inaccessible to Americans living in many parts of the country, officials said the administration is planning to launch new "federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites" beyond the 2,200 locations currently in the program.\n\n"I think we\'re going to be working really closely with these new federally supported sites, work directly with state, territorial, and jurisdictional leadership to identify the places that need more support," said an administration official.\n\nChallenges and questions\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the new moves do not address some of the criticisms levied against the Biden administration\'s treatment effort.\n\nDespite objections from pharmacy trade groups, the FDA excludes most pharmacists from being able to prescribe Paxlovid or Lagevrio. For at-risk Americans without access to a "test-to-treat" drugstore that has a qualifying provider available, this means some will have to make multiple trips to get the pills.\n\n"You have to develop COVID symptoms, you have to subsequently get a test for COVID-19, get the result of that test, find and go to see a provider, get a prescription, and then fill that prescription. That\'s six steps in five days," said an official.\n\nIt also does not include an expansion to who is eligible to take the drugs under the FDA\'s emergency use authorization.\n\nSpeaking at Uniformed Services University earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president\'s chief medical adviser, hinted that Paxlovid might soon be expanded to lower-risk patients "in order to prevent them possibly from getting long COVID."\n\nBoth Pfizer and Merck have also been running a range of trials that might support expanding use of the antiviral pills to more people. Results could come soon from a trial assessing Paxlovid in people who are exposed to the disease, but have not yet developed symptoms, which was due to be completed earlier this month.\n\nAnd administration officials at the briefing did not bring up growing reports of "rebound" or "relapse" symptoms — people who appear to recover from COVID-19 after taking the antiviral pills, but later get a new round of symptoms — which might lead to SARS-CoV-2 evolving resistance to the treatments.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer said the company was continuing to monitor data from their clinical trials of Paxlovid as well as real-world evidence, and has "not seen any resistance" to the drug.\n\nIn a statement, an FDA spokesperson acknowledged that reports of rebound "are important to evaluate further," but reiterated that the drug appeared 88% effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization or death in its clinical trial.\n\n"The FDA is evaluating the reports of viral load rebound after completing Paxlovid treatment and will share recommendations if appropriate," said the FDA\'s Chanapa Tantibanchachai.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/75834f94-0c35-4873-8166-5e4b24cfa0d3/thumbnail/1200x630/5625e6265f72e4689718b2845b0511c4/gettyimages-1238865166.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:48'}

Given this, it is important to underscore that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have sent his forces into Ukraine in the first place if President Biden had not demonstrated such weakness on the world stage in his first year in office.\n\nFour U.S. presidents have been elected so far this century, and, with Putin effectively in power in his country for the entire time, Russia has invaded a neighboring country on the watch of three of those four presidents. In 2008, during President George W. Bush’s last year in office, Russia invaded Georgia. In 2014, under President Barack Obama, Putin sent his forces into Ukraine, annexing Crimea, and he did so again eight years later, one year into Biden’s tenure.\n\nSay what you want about our 45th president, but Donald Trump remains the only U.S. president elected this century during whose term Putin decided not to invade a neighboring country.\n\nThe reason Putin did not do so was that Trump demonstrated undisputed strength on the world stage, in everything from knocking heads with his NATO partners and getting them to pay their fair share in that alliance, calling out Germany for its dependence on Russian oil and gas, eliminating the ISIS caliphate and killing its leader al-Baghdadi, deterring Iran, standing up to China, beginning the pullout from Afghanistan after 19 years of war in that country, forging the first peace agreement between Israel and several of its Arab neighbors in a quarter-century, and reducing illegal border-crossing from citizens of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras by 85 percent, among other accomplishments.\n\nBiden did the opposite. He demonstrated weakness early on with respect to China, whose leaders lectured Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Alaska on race relations. Biden also failed to hold Chinese Communist Party leaders accountable for possibly developing, and certainly spreading the virus around the world that has killed just short of 1 million Americans to date.\n\nSimilarly, Biden started up talks with Iran on re-entering the weak Obama nuclear deal that Trump scuttled while failing to add countries to the historic Abraham Accords with Israel. Perhaps most telling for Putin, Biden bungled the exit from Afghanistan, losing 13 of our bravest men and women in uniform in the process and turning over the country to the Taliban, this time armed with some $80 billion of lethal NATO-supplied military equipment, and failing to hold anyone accountable for that debacle.\n\nWith Putin himself, Biden gave in on completing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany that Trump had blocked, and Biden asked for nothing in return.\n\nNow, two months into Putin’s second invasion of Ukraine in eight years, it is important to remember that Biden’s weakness on national security gave a green light to the Russian leader’s longtime ambitions for further military action in Ukraine that he held in check for four years under Biden’s immediate predecessor. In the wake of Blinken and Austin meeting with Zelensky, the Ukrainian president should bear in mind what, and who, set the stage for where we stand today.\n\nMr. Ullyot served as deputy assistant to the president for national security affairs and National Security Council spokesman, 2019-21.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the CEO of Truth Social, told Fox News earlier on Monday that the 45th president will not return to Twitter. Nunes said that “he really doesn’t have an interest in going on Twitter.”\n\nTruth Social has reportedly seen an uptick in installations over the past weekend. According to estimates shared with The Hill by Sensor Tower on Monday, Truth Social has seen approximately 1.4 million installs from the App Store to date — reaching more than 60,000 on Saturday and Sunday combined, six times higher than previous weekends and the most daily installs since its February launch.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/article_images-trump_011622ap.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:59'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million.\n\nLack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces.\n\nShares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April.\n\nSince Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists.\n\nIf Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences.\n\n“The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92109698abfe8cebc8ed79f918f6e0cb5a652cf/0_156_5131_3078/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c9734ab4bdc644afa8fecabe2eaf914', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:29'}

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government....Therefore,Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?” he said. “If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?” He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.\n\n“‘Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?’” — Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank\n\nIn the company’s early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:43'}

Carlson’s account also re-posted a comment from Charlie Kirk saying Levine spent “54 years of his life as a man.”\n\nThe move comes after tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Twitter came to an agreement for Musk to take the company private for $44 billion on Monday.\n\n“A free Twitter would mean a direct challenge to the people in charge of our country’s institutions many of whom are incompetent,” Carlson said on his top-rated Fox News program on Monday evening. “For the first time in years we’ll be able to talk honestly about our leaders. We’ll be able to have the kind of conversations that make democracy possible.”\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter triggered questions about whether certain users, including former President Donald Trump, would return to the platform.

The twenty-seven member states of the European Union reached an agreement on a new law requiring big online platforms, including social-media companies, to police hate speech and disinformation more effectively. Under the E.U.’s Digital Services Act, European governments now have the power to ask Web platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to remove any content that promotes terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse, or commercial scams. The platforms will also be obliged to prevent the “manipulation of services having an impact on democratic processes and public security.”\n\n“The time of big online platforms behaving like they are ‘too big to care’ is coming to an end,” Thierry Breton, the E.U.’s commissioner for the internal market, declared. If the European authorities see a surge of online disinformation during a crisis, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, they will be able to order social-media companies to take “proportionate and effective measures” to counter the threat. Although the new E.U. agreement stops short of treating online platforms the same as traditional publishers (which may be legally liable for intentionally false content about specific individuals and companies), it will force them to provide users with “an easy and effective way” to flag harmful content, so that it can be removed. The platforms will also be subject to annual audits by European regulators on their efforts to counter disinformation and other abuses. Platforms that violate the new law can be fined billions of dollars, and repeat offenders may even be banned from doing business in the E.U.\n\nIronically, the E.U. members adopted the new measures only days before the board of directors of Twitter entered into an agreement to sell the company to Elon Musk, a self-styled defender of free speech and a vigorous opponent of government regulation, for about forty-four billion dollars. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders,” Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, who is also the co-C.E.O. of the software company Salesforce, said in a statement.\n\nEvidently, financial considerations overrode any reservations that the members of Twitter’s board may have had about selling the company to Musk, who has frequently criticized its management and demanded changes in how the site operates. Musk’s bid of fifty-four dollars and twenty cents a share represents a premium of close to forty per cent over the firm’s stock price on April 1st, immediately before he disclosed that he had acquired a nine-per-cent stake in the company. But, even though the financial logic of the deal is straightforward, the implications of Musk taking control of Twitter are, from a broader perspective, potentially highly problematic, especially since he still hasn’t answered some pressing questions about his intentions for the site, including whether he plans to allow Donald Trump back onto it.\n\n[Support The New Yorker’s award-winning journalism. Subscribe today »]\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Musk said that he wanted “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” These aren’t necessarily bad ideas. Allowing users to edit tweets and authenticating their identities could conceivably improve Twitter. The idea of opening up Twitter’s algorithm also sounds benign, although it could clash with the goal of defeating the bots, because once the spammers know Twitter’s formula for serving up tweets they may be better able to game it.\n\nBut none of Musk’s suggestions addressed the fundamental issue of which approach Twitter will now take toward content moderation. Will the company maintain the heavy investments in artificial intelligence and human monitors that it has made in recent years? Will it expand these monitoring efforts as demanded by the new European law? Or will it move in the other direction, dismantling them and allowing the return of former users it had suspended or banned, particularly Trump?\n\nBased on the signs so far, the answer to the last question is yes, Trump and others who have been banned will return. Even though Trump currently insists that he won’t return even if he is invited—he has his own social-media app to promote—many of his supporters are openly celebrating the news of Musk’s takeover. During a staff meeting on Monday, a Twitter employee asked Parag Agrawal, the firm’s chief executive, whether Trump would be allowed back. “We constantly evolve our policies,” Agrawal replied. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know what direction this company will go in.”\n\nBased on some of his public statements, Musk seems intent on taking Twitter back to the not at all distant era when social media was a free-for-all. “I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things,” he said, in an interview earlier this month. If Twitter does go in this direction, it could encounter pushback from corporate advertisers that don’t like being associated with disinformation, incitement, and controversy. Musk has suggested that Twitter should grow its subscriptions base to become less dependent on advertisers, but it’s not clear how many people would pay to use the site, especially if its contents are largely unfiltered.\n\nMusk has also said that his pursuit of Twitter is driven by the desire to protect free speech and “help freedomn in the world” rather than to make money. These are fine-sounding words, but it sometimes seems as if Musk’s notion of free speech amounts to attacking and lampooning anybody who challenges him, including the financial regulators who charged him with securities fraud and fined him twenty million dollars for tweeting misleading information in 2018 about a possible buyout of Tesla. “Even as Twitter’s board on Monday was debating his offer . . . Mr. Musk was setting the tone for his leadership by tweeting that Securities and Exchange Commission officials were ‘shameless puppets,’ ” Greg Bensinger, a member of the Times’ editorial board, noted. Last week, Musk used his Twitter account, which has about eighty-five million followers, to try fat-shaming Bill Gates, whom he also accused of speculating against Tesla’s stock.\n\nIn a column for the Guardian, Robert Reich, a former U.S. Secretary of Labor, argued that Musk’s real goal in purchasing Twitter is to create a position for himself where he is unaccountable to anything, from laws to market competition. Whether that’s entirely accurate or not, the pending takeover provides yet another confirmation that Congress needs to treat the big online platforms like the social utilities they are, and regulate them. A first step would be to pass the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, in January. This legislation would prohibit dominant platforms, such as Amazon and Google, from exploiting their market power to boost their own products by discriminating against their competitors.\n\nRegulating content in a manner consistent with protecting free speech may be a trickier proposition, but the E.U. has just provided a road map for how it could be done: by putting the onus on social-media companies to monitor and remove harmful content, and hit them with big fines if they don’t. The Digital Services Act is “nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation,” Ben Scott, the executive director of the advocacy group Reset, told the Associated Press. “It’s the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic systems in digital media markets.”\n\nMusk would surely object to the U.S. adopting a regulatory system like the one that the Europeans are drawing up, but that’s too bad. The health of the Internet—and, most important, democracy—is too significant to leave to one man, no matter how rich he is.', 'image': 'https://media.newyorker.com/photos/626806ef6d0339f5142c2b06/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cassidy-musk-twitter.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:20'}

The constitutional protection of speech does not, on its own, engender a society in which the chance to be heard is truly abundant and free and equitably distributed.\n\n“Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep,” Mr. Berlin once said. This is a point often lost on Americans. Government — or large centralized authority — is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn’t censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.\n\nThe plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to. We’re going to have to build nonprofit alternatives to the platforms and see if they can become meaningful venues.', 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/opinion/26giridharadas_2/26giridharadas_2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:34'}

It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke.

He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015.

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:56'}

That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform.

It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nThe text of the new law still needs formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries, but it is unlikely to change substantially from what lawmakers agreed to last week.\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence in a post on Twitter earlier Tuesday that the company under Mr. Musk’s ownership would conform to the EU’s new rules.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Mr. Breton wrote. “Mr Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter could mark an eventual test case for the EU’s new legislation once it comes into effect, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank.

For one thing, Twitter is a private company, rather than a genuinely public space, which means that it is not bound by the First Amendment. Unlike the actual town square, Twitter retains the right to punish users for perfectly legal speech. It\'s also the case that while Twitter is incredibly important for the political class, journalists, business leaders, and other social influencers, it\'s not nearly as big or as frequently visited as Facebook, YouTube, or TikTok. As Techdirt\'s Mike Masnick put it, the entire internet is really the town square; Twitter is one small space that\'s part of it.\n\nTwitter\'s social importance is inflated by media and political figures because the site is their preferred virtual meeting ground. This is true of Musk himself; he clearly enjoys the platform, and uses it to great effect, and thus may be overstating its importance to society. But there are many others ways to communicate political messages, and if Twitter ceased to exist tomorrow, it\'s doubtful that anyone\'s ability to speak would be irreparably harmed.\n\nAdmittedly, the people really overstating Twitter\'s importance are actually Musk\'s critics in progressive and mainstream media. And boy are they overstating it: Current Affairs Editor in Chief Nathan Robinson fretted that "the only comforting reason to think [former President] Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable."\n\nThe only comforting reason to think Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable. — Nathan J Robinson (@NathanJRobinson) April 25, 2022\n\nRobinson apparently thinks that Trump\'s ability to win reelection hinges on whether he\'s on Twitter. Not the shape of the U.S. economy, the direction of the pandemic, or whether President Joe Biden\'s ill-considered policies have created an opening for the former president…but Twitter.\n\nFrustratingly, many liberals and progressives—especially in the media—have convinced themselves that the only way to effectively counter bad speech is to label it misinformation or harassment and prevent it from being uttered. This runs counter to Musk\'s stated views on the subject, which reflect classically liberal ideas about speech.\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nIt\'s strange to see this idea—that silencing opponents is not only self-defeating but also wrong on principle—transformed into an explicitly right-wing talking point. This is a demoralizing result of the new political reality, in which the journalists and bureaucrats who comprise Team Blue fear and distrust speech they cannot control, while Team Red purports to love free speech even as its political figures wage war on speech they do not like. And it\'s one that does not work to Democrats\' advantage; as Nate Silver points out, free speech in the abstract is extremely popular among the voting public.\n\nThe best way to de-politicize the social media free speech debate—and the optimal thing that Musk could do with control of Twitter—would be to devolve content curation to individual users, as I explained in The Los Angeles Times:\n\n"Elon Musk\'s best bet would be to devolve content curation to individual users. Many on the right are frustrated with Twitter\'s inconsistently applied rules, regardless of whether they are enforced by algorithms or by human employees of the company; many progressives, on the other hand, are afraid that lax moderation means more misinformation or harassment. The least polarizing way forward is to give users more means of controlling their own feeds. If you have a low tolerance for unpleasantness, you should be able to turn on a setting that shields you from the worst of what can appear on the platform. If you prefer the Wild West, there should be a setting for you, too."\n\nIn any case, I hope that fixing Twitter doesn\'t distract Musk from his far more important goal of colonizing Mars (something NPR criticized as imperialist, because of course they did).

Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:39'}

I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.\n\n“If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nBreton spoke as human rights groups reacted to the Twitter board accepting Musk’s bid with warnings of damaging consequences if the billionaire’s commitment to free speech results in a loosening of restrictions on harmful content.\n\nAmnesty International said it was concerned about any decision that Twitter may take after Musk’s takeover to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to moderate hate speech online.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others,” Michael Kleinman, director of technology and human rights at Amnesty International USA,\n\nDeborah Brown, a digital rights researcher and advocate at Human Rights Watch, said even small changes to the platform could have a devastating impact.\n\nThe UK is also introducing a tougher regulatory regime for digital platforms with the online safety bill, which requires businesses such as Twitter and Facebook to protect users from harmful content and carries the threat of fines of up to 10% of global turnover for breaches.\n\nImran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a campaign group, said: “The UK and the EU are going to have tools to deal with this. Twitter is going to find it very difficult to operate in the UK if it tries to operate on a completely free speech, zero-rules basis.”\n\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has backed Musk takeover of the micro-blogging platform, describing the billionaire as “the singular solution I trust”.\n\nThe 45-year-old, who co-founded the company in 2006 and floated it on the New York Stock Exchange in 2013, said it has been “owned” by Wall Street and that Musk’s deal struck on Monday to take it private was the “correct first step”.\n\nHowever, Dorsey, who stepped down as Twitter chief executive in November and will receive a $978m payout for his 2.4% stake when the deal is completed later this year, said that ultimately “in principle I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter”.\n\nParag Agrawal, who took over from Dorsey as chief executive, has told staff that their jobs are only safe for about the six months it will take to get the deal done.\n\n"He\'s more powerful than countries now," said Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor $tsla $twtr https://t.co/0sc0XOtOW4 — Ross Gerber (@GerberKawasaki) April 25, 2022\n\nDonald Trump, who was permanently banned from Twitter after the US Capitol riots last January, has said he would not return to the platform even if Musk allowed him.

Trump feeds on attention and will once again disseminate his cries through Twitter’s unholy megaphone, just not right away. For the moment, it’s more expedient for Trump to promote his social network, which I promise virtually nobody will ever ever use. As of early April, TRUTH reportedly had just north of 500,000 daily active users, paling in comparison to Twitter’s 217 million or so DAUs, as Vanity Fair pointed out yesterday. Sure, the former president has the power to juice an app’s ranking for, say, a few weeks, but check back in a year and you’ll see what I mean.\n\nBut looking ahead, when Trump’s 2024 campaign kicks into high gear, do you think he’ll choose loyalty to TRUTH Social, of all things, over Twitter and its outsized media reach? No. Trump is not loyal to anything. Given the chance, he will return. Next question.\n\nHow can we know Musk will lift the ban? He hasn’t said anything, has he?\n\nMusk has said enough, but please, allow me a moment to backtrack.\n\nWhen Twitter banned Trump, some of the president’s thirstiest supporters protested the move in defense of “free speech,” arguing that the safeguard against government overreach should also cover drivel on Twitter’s website. This is absurd, but Musk’s views on free speech and content moderation pretty much jive with their outlook, and conservatives know it. (Personally, I’d rather build a hospitable town square that people want to visit, versus one that celebrates these weirdos, but that wouldn’t be very Twitter, would it?)\n\nInstead of wading into the nitty gritty of content moderation, for example, Musk seemingly wants to feel it out and hopes even his “worst critics” stick around to post. If that’s what he’s focused on, then why wouldn’t he also welcome Rosie O’Donnell’s worst critic back into the fold?\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nAt least Jack trusts Elon, right?\n\nIt sure sounds like he does! Not long after Twitter’s board accepted Musk’s offer, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey spoke up in support of the website’s incoming acquirer. After a strong caveat that, “in principal,” he does not “believe anyone should own or run Twitter,” Dorsey said that “Elon is the singular solution I trust” when it comes to “solving for the problem of it being a company.” And believe me, you can trust Musk — to singularly shrug and subject us to @RealDonaldTrump all over again.\n\nTwitter’s decision to ban Trump in the first place came down to just two tweets, and hinged primarily on their timing and context following the January 6 riot. That’s shaky ground to begin with. Add in Musk’s management and posting ideology, which is not compatible with fussy concepts such as nuance, and baby, you’ve got a stew going. Instead, the serial CEO is far too busy union busting, hating on critics and doing things for the lolz to concern himself with ideals like community health or treating people with dignity.', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229173793.jpg?w=600', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:05'}

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble.

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices.

It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free."

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular amongst Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end, but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even amongst his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nPresently we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remember that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment after years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared to Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://www.lifesitenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1354093065.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:44'}

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase.

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:50'}

After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return.\n\n“Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported.\n\nTrump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter.\n\n“If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time.\n\nTrump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once.\n\nIf that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices.\n\nIn terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported.

Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.\n\nHow Twitter operates won’t be entirely up to Mr. Musk.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk’s ownership, would conform to the bloc’s new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.\n\nMr. Musk’s planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.’s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.\n\n“It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,” said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTwitter’s existing content policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. Photo: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world’s richest person, is one of Twitter’s most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday’s deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter’s algorithms to public scrutiny, “defeat” spammers and authenticate users’ identities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views “free speech” as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said in a tweet. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government....Therefore,Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nSome industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter’s efforts risks stoking advertisers’ worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?” he said. “If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?” He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.\n\n“‘Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?’” — Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank\n\nIn the company’s early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims’ families.\n\nIt stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.\n\nOther industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.\n\nTheir efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change.\n\nTwitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.\n\nMore moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nThose bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.\n\nMany in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk’s planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Technology A weekly digest of tech reviews, headlines, columns and your questions answered by WSJ's Personal Tech gurus. PREVIEW\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday’s Twitter deal, though he said he doesn’t see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. “This is a great, great day,” the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. “Finally we’re getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.”\n\nTwitter’s existing policies haven’t brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising—which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model. The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk’s handling of the former president’s account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk’s ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn’t clear.\n\n—Patience Haggin contributed to this article.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531039/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:43'}

Carlson’s account also re-posted a comment from Charlie Kirk saying Levine spent “54 years of his life as a man.”\n\nThe move comes after tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Twitter came to an agreement for Musk to take the company private for $44 billion on Monday.\n\n“A free Twitter would mean a direct challenge to the people in charge of our country’s institutions many of whom are incompetent,” Carlson said on his top-rated Fox News program on Monday evening. “For the first time in years we’ll be able to talk honestly about our leaders. We’ll be able to have the kind of conversations that make democracy possible.”\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter triggered questions about whether certain users, including former President Donald Trump, would return to the platform. Trump, however, told news outlets Monday that he plans on staying with his social media site Truth Social and won’t return to Twitter.\n\n“We’re taking in millions of people, and what we’re finding is that the response on Truth is much better than being on Twitter. Twitter has bots and fake accounts, and we are doing everything we can,” Trump said. So far, Trump has only made one post on Truth Social since it was launched in February 2022.\n\nIn mid-April, Trump told Americano News that “Twitter’s become very boring” in recent months because “they’ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter … a lot of their conservative voices.”\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform.

The twenty-seven member states of the European Union reached an agreement on a new law requiring big online platforms, including social-media companies, to police hate speech and disinformation more effectively. Under the E.U.’s Digital Services Act, European governments now have the power to ask Web platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to remove any content that promotes terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse, or commercial scams. The platforms will also be obliged to prevent the “manipulation of services having an impact on democratic processes and public security.”\n\n“The time of big online platforms behaving like they are ‘too big to care’ is coming to an end,” Thierry Breton, the E.U.’s commissioner for the internal market, declared. If the European authorities see a surge of online disinformation during a crisis, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, they will be able to order social-media companies to take “proportionate and effective measures” to counter the threat. Although the new E.U. agreement stops short of treating online platforms the same as traditional publishers (which may be legally liable for intentionally false content about specific individuals and companies), it will force them to provide users with “an easy and effective way” to flag harmful content, so that it can be removed. The platforms will also be subject to annual audits by European regulators on their efforts to counter disinformation and other abuses. Platforms that violate the new law can be fined billions of dollars, and repeat offenders may even be banned from doing business in the E.U.\n\nIronically, the E.U. members adopted the new measures only days before the board of directors of Twitter entered into an agreement to sell the company to Elon Musk, a self-styled defender of free speech and a vigorous opponent of government regulation, for about forty-four billion dollars. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders,” Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, who is also the co-C.E.O. of the software company Salesforce, said in a statement.\n\nEvidently, financial considerations overrode any reservations that the members of Twitter’s board may have had about selling the company to Musk, who has frequently criticized its management and demanded changes in how the site operates. Musk’s bid of fifty-four dollars and twenty cents a share represents a premium of close to forty per cent over the firm’s stock price on April 1st, immediately before he disclosed that he had acquired a nine-per-cent stake in the company. But, even though the financial logic of the deal is straightforward, the implications of Musk taking control of Twitter are, from a broader perspective, potentially highly problematic, especially since he still hasn’t answered some pressing questions about his intentions for the site, including whether he plans to allow Donald Trump back onto it.\n\n[Support The New Yorker’s award-winning journalism. Subscribe today »]\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Musk said that he wanted “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” These aren’t necessarily bad ideas. Allowing users to edit tweets and authenticating their identities could conceivably improve Twitter. The idea of opening up Twitter’s algorithm also sounds benign, although it could clash with the goal of defeating the bots, because once the spammers know Twitter’s formula for serving up tweets they may be better able to game it.\n\nBut none of Musk’s suggestions addressed the fundamental issue of which approach Twitter will now take toward content moderation. Will the company maintain the heavy investments in artificial intelligence and human monitors that it has made in recent years? Will it expand these monitoring efforts as demanded by the new European law? Or will it move in the other direction, dismantling them and allowing the return of former users it had suspended or banned, particularly Trump?\n\nBased on the signs so far, the answer to the last question is yes, Trump and others who have been banned will return. Even though Trump currently insists that he won’t return even if he is invited—he has his own social-media app to promote—many of his supporters are openly celebrating the news of Musk’s takeover. During a staff meeting on Monday, a Twitter employee asked Parag Agrawal, the firm’s chief executive, whether Trump would be allowed back. “We constantly evolve our policies,” Agrawal replied. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know what direction this company will go in.”\n\nBased on some of his public statements, Musk seems intent on taking Twitter back to the not at all distant era when social media was a free-for-all. “I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things,” he said, in an interview earlier this month. If Twitter does go in this direction, it could encounter pushback from corporate advertisers that don’t like being associated with disinformation, incitement, and controversy. Musk has suggested that Twitter should grow its subscriptions base to become less dependent on advertisers, but it’s not clear how many people would pay to use the site, especially if its contents are largely unfiltered.\n\nMusk has also said that his pursuit of Twitter is driven by the desire to protect free speech and “help freedomn in the world” rather than to make money. These are fine-sounding words, but it sometimes seems as if Musk’s notion of free speech amounts to attacking and lampooning anybody who challenges him, including the financial regulators who charged him with securities fraud and fined him twenty million dollars for tweeting misleading information in 2018 about a possible buyout of Tesla. “Even as Twitter’s board on Monday was debating his offer . . . Mr. Musk was setting the tone for his leadership by tweeting that Securities and Exchange Commission officials were ‘shameless puppets,’ ” Greg Bensinger, a member of the Times’ editorial board, noted. Last week, Musk used his Twitter account, which has about eighty-five million followers, to try fat-shaming Bill Gates, whom he also accused of speculating against Tesla’s stock.\n\nIn a column for the Guardian, Robert Reich, a former U.S. Secretary of Labor, argued that Musk’s real goal in purchasing Twitter is to create a position for himself where he is unaccountable to anything, from laws to market competition. Whether that’s entirely accurate or not, the pending takeover provides yet another confirmation that Congress needs to treat the big online platforms like the social utilities they are, and regulate them. A first step would be to pass the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, in January. This legislation would prohibit dominant platforms, such as Amazon and Google, from exploiting their market power to boost their own products by discriminating against their competitors.\n\nRegulating content in a manner consistent with protecting free speech may be a trickier proposition, but the E.U. has just provided a road map for how it could be done: by putting the onus on social-media companies to monitor and remove harmful content, and hit them with big fines if they don’t. The Digital Services Act is “nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation,” Ben Scott, the executive director of the advocacy group Reset, told the Associated Press. “It’s the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic systems in digital media markets.”\n\nMusk would surely object to the U.S. adopting a regulatory system like the one that the Europeans are drawing up, but that’s too bad. The health of the Internet—and, most important, democracy—is too significant to leave to one man, no matter how rich he is.', 'image': 'https://media.newyorker.com/photos/626806ef6d0339f5142c2b06/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cassidy-musk-twitter.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:20'}

The constitutional protection of speech does not, on its own, engender a society in which the chance to be heard is truly abundant and free and equitably distributed.\n\n“Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep,” Mr. Berlin once said. This is a point often lost on Americans. Government — or large centralized authority — is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn’t censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.\n\nThe “censorship” that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech — the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.\n\nThis is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech — real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.\n\nThe country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy.

That’s just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people’s minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we’re going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We’re going to have to legislate real guardrails — perhaps like those created by the European Union’s Digital Services Act — on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to.

It plunged when he joked about it on air on Saturday Night Live last May. In December, it went up when he said Tesla would accept the coin as payment for merchandise.\n\nThe 'joke' crypto that started as a meme... what is Dogecoin? Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created as a 'joke' in 2013. Its mascot is a Shiba Inu dog, made popular from the 'doge' meme featuring photos of the canine overlaid with text written in broken English. It can be bought or sold on crypto exchanges like Coinbase or on trading apps like Robinhood and Webull. One Dogecoin is worth 16 cents as of Tuesday morning. It's never been worth more than 64 cents. Creator Billy Markus said last year that he invented the coin as a joke. 'I'm half detached, but it's weird that something I made in a few hours is now part of internet culture,' he said. 'It's amusing to see Elon Musk talk about it. It feels silly, but there's this huge upwelling behind it.'

The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive,' he added.\n\n'Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?'\n\nSome Twitter users are worried about the future of the company at the hands of Musk, who is known to use the platform to post inflammatory messages and tease his followers, sometimes with the idea of using Dogecoin legitimately.\n\nIn January, he tweeted: 'Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin.'\n\nThe stock went up by more than 15 percent that same day, CNBC reports.\n\nLast May, Musk played a financial expert trying to explain crypto on SNL's Weekend Update segment.\n\n'They're a type of digital money but instead of being controlled by a central Government, they're decentralized using blockchain technology,' he explained, letting out a nervous giggle.\n\nIn a bit about how difficult it is to explain, the segment's host repeatedly asked him, 'What is dogecoin?'\n\n'I keep telling you, it's a cryptocurrency you can trade for conventional money.'\n\nDogecoin creator Billy Markus admitted last year that he created the coin as a joke, and that it was 'amusing' to see Elon Musk promoting it\n\n'Oh, so it's a hustle,' Michael Che finally said.\n\n'Yeah, it's a hustle,' Musk replied.\n\nThe stock dived by 22 percent while the show was airing.\n\nDogecoin creator Billy Markus told Bloomberg last year that he invented the coin as a joke.\n\nThe coin was being traded a lot early last year, reaching a high of 64 cents in May, months after amateur investors managed to send shares of video game retailer GameStop soaring.\n\nMarkus cashed in his Dogecoin and abandoned his pet project in 2015.\n\n'I'm half detached, but it's weird that something I made in a few hours is now part of internet culture,' he said.

Co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) holds a board seat, but is expected to give it up in May\n\nMusk is known for using Twitter to post inflammatory messages, much like former President Donald Trump.\n\nParag Agrawal, the CEO, said on Monday that it was up to Musk to decide whether to readmit Trump.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would not be rejoining the site if Musk allowed him to - instead saying he would continue to use his own TRUTH Social.\n\nSome experts are pointing to a tough road ahead for Twitter if Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, gets his way.\n\n'We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.\n\nThe 16-year old company, which has emerged as one of the world's most influential online public squares with about over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.\n\n'The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,' Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.\n\nTesla tycoon versus Big Tech: How swashbuckling billionaire Elon Musk fought off 'poison pill', lawsuits and hostile board of directors before $44bn Twitter takeover\n\nIt has been one of the most dramatic takeover attempts in history, seeing a swashbuckling billionaire pitted against one of the largest tech giants in the world.\n\nBut Elon Musk's seizing of Twitter has been a months-long pursuit that has seen him send shockwaves through the world of business.\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online.\n\nHe quickly rocketed to the top of its shareholders' list, acquiring a huge 9% stake in the tech giant.\n\nBut then he hit choppy waters, accepting a place on the board then rejecting it, getting embroiled in lawsuits and seeing rival companies circle to buy Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile bosses at the social media firm appeared to do all they could to ensure he could not not seize it - even launching a 'poison pill' strategy to sink his chances.\n\nYet Musk brazenly blasted through all the obstacles, punting a $43 billion offer earlier this month and showing how he would finance it.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning on Monday to finalize the 'fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nIt saw Twitter shares in the US soar by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share.\n\nOn Monday, Musk called for his 'worst critics' to remain on the platform because 'that is what free speech means'.\n\nHere, DailyMail.com looks at the rollercoaster journey he has been on over the last few months as he seizes his prize.\n\n\n\nThe Tesla magnate started hoarding shares in the social media firm at the start of the year in an apparent bid to preserve free speech online\n\nJanuary 31: Musk hoards Twitter shares and buys them 'almost daily'\n\nMusk started buying Twitter stock on January 31 and continued to buy shares during every trading session through April 1, according to an SEC filing.\n\nJust days earlier, he told his 80 million followers on the site he was ' giving serious thought ' to creating his own social media platform.\n\nA user asked him: 'Would you consider building a new social media platform, @elonmusk?\n\n'One that would consist an open source algorithm, one where free speech and adhering to free speech is given top priority, one where propaganda is very minimal. I think that kind of a platform is needed.'\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO replied through his official account: 'Am giving serious thought to this.'\n\nThe billionaire businessman, 50, appeared to be suggesting he was sick of Twitter over the right to freedom of speech.\n\nApril 4: Musk says he bought 9.2 percent stake in firm a month earlier\n\nMusk revealed he had purchased a 9.2 percent stake in the social media giant on March 14.\n\nHe tweeted 'oh hi lol' after the news sent shockwaves through the business world and across social media. He added: 'Do you want an edit button?'\n\nApril 5: He joins Twitter's board of directors - sees share price rocket\n\nTwitter said the tech tycoon was joining the company's board of directors, causing the social media platform's shares to rise over 7 per cent in premarket trading.\n\nIt led to speculation he would try to address what he called the platform's 'failure to adhere to free speech principles' and 'fundamentally undermine democracy'.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Musk would have served on the board until the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAs long as he remains a director, the agreement said, he could not won more than 14.9 percent of the company's stock.\n\nIt meant he would not have been able to take over the company until well after his term on the board was over.\n\nThe firm said: 'Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules.\n\n'Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.'\n\n'As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service.\n\n'Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.'\n\nApril 8: Asset managers take over Musk as largest shareholders\n\nAsset manager Vanguard Group increased its stake to overtake Musk as the largest shareholder.\n\nVanguard owned 10.3 percent of Twitter, while the Tesla tycoon owned 9.1 per cent, making him the largest individual shareholder.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8.\n\nIt previously reported owning 67.2million shares of Twitter or about 8.4 per cent of the company as of the end of December, according to FactSet.\n\nOther owners of large quantities of Twitter stock included Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Black Rock.\n\nVanguard, led by CEO Tim Buckley, increased its stake in the company at some point during the first quarter, according to SEC filings made on April 8\n\nApril 9: Musk rejects the offer to join Twitter's board of directors\n\nMusk rejected an offer to join Twitter's board after disclosing his stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts said the move signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.'\n\nHe said: 'The board and I had many discussions about Elon joining the board, and with Elon directly. We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks.\n\n'We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward. The board offered him a seat.'\n\nAgrawal continued: 'We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the board contingent on a background check and formal acceptance.\n\n'Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board.'\n\nParag Agrawal said the board would still 'remain open' to Musk's input, but warned: 'There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged'\n\nApril 12: Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella files suit against Musk\n\nMarc Bain Rasella filed a lawsuit against Musk for alleged securities fraud at a Manhattan federal court, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe suit claimed the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the SEC by March 24, but the delay kept Twitter's share price down allowing Musk to buy more.\n\nMusk was accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least five per cent.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, Musk did not disclose his position in Twitter until he had almost doubled his stake to more than nine per cent.\n\nThat strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.\n\nApril 14: The Tesla tycoon offers to buy Twitter for $43 BILLION\n\nMusk offered to buy Twitter for $43billion, a regulatory filing showed, as he moved to seize the social media giant.\n\nMusk's offer price of $54.20 per share represented a 38 per cent premium to the closing price of Twitter's stock on April 1.\n\nThis was the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's over nine per cent investment in the company was publicly announced.\n\nIt even appeared to reference marijuana - also known as 420 - a common reference used by Musk on Twitter.\n\nTwitter said in a regulatory filing Musk provided a letter containing a proposal to buy the remaining shares of Twitter he did not already own.\n\nApril 15: Twitter launches 'poison pill' strategy to stop Musk buyout\n\nTwitter's board announced a dramatic poison pill plan to prevent Musk from increasing his stake in the company.\n\nAlso known as a shareholder rights provision, the plan would trigger a dilution of shares if any shareholder builds up a 15 per cent stake without the board's approval.\n\nThe plan did not prevent Twitter from accepting Musk's offer or entering negotiations with him or other potential buyers.\n\nBut it did stop the billionaire from putting pressure on the board by buying up ever more shares on the open market.\n\nMusk hit back with a laughing emoji to a version of the classic 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme mocking Twitter's board.\n\nThe imaged depicted 'Twitter's board' looking wistfully at the option to 'keep that easy gig that gives me shares' as 'Twitter investors' look on with disgust.\n\nTwitter's board is led by chairman Bret Taylor, who is also the co-CEO of business software giant Salesforce\n\nApril 16: Musk tweets Love Me Tender in tease of hostile takeover\n\nMusk tweeted 'Love Me Tender' as he again teased at the possibility of a hostile takeover of Twitter.\n\nThe billionaire posted the Elvis Presley lyrics in a potential bid to lure shareholders with a tender offer that could see him seize control.\n\nA tender offer would see him bypass the board and go to shareholders with his offer of $54.20 a share - but he would need to show how he would finance his bid.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest he would strip board members of their salaries, saying they would get '$0 if my bid succeeds'.\n\nApril 18: Jack Dorsey slams the Twitter board for 'plots and coups'\n\nJack Dorsey slammed the board of Twitter as he weighed into the toxic fight over Elon Musk's attempted hostile takeover for the first time.\n\nThe former CEO, who is still a member of the board himself, blasted the 'plots and coups' that were 'consistently the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nIn a series of bombshell tweets and replies, he endorsed one posting saying that 'a bad board will kill a company every time'.\n\nReplying to one post, he said: 'When I was fired in 2008 and made chair, the board took most of my shares away from me.\n\n'I also gave 1 per cent of the company back to the employee pool in 2015. So, ended up with very little of company.'\n\nHe also replied to one comment mentioning 'plots and coups' in the Twitter board saying: 'it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company'.\n\nEarlier in the thread, he replied to a post quoting a 'Silicon Valley proverb' by venture capitalist Fred Destin.\n\nIt said: 'Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.' Dorsey said: 'Big facts.'\n\nFormer CEO Dorsey slammed Twitter's board of directors on as he replied to a series of unfriendly tweets\n\nApril 21: SpaceX boss unveils his $46.5billion financing package\n\nElon Musk unveiled his $46.5billion financing package to fund his takeover of Twitter - using Tesla as collateral.\n\nThe world's richest man filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining how he would seize the social media giant.\n\nHe committed $21billion in equity, $13billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5billion from the bank and others in margin loans.\n\nBut 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm.\n\nThe 50-year-old billionaire also revealed he was weighing up launching a tender offer for Twitter after the company ignored his acquisition offer.\n\nHe said he was exploring getting stocks directly from shareholders but admitted he 'has not determined whether to do so at this time'.\n\nMusk filed the document with the SEC showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $46.5billion.\n\nHe secured a debt commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding to the tune of $13billion in financing.\n\nThis was made up of a loan of $6.5billion, a senior secured revolving facility for $500million, a bridge loan of up to $3billion and an unsecured bridge loan for up to $3billion.\n\nHe also got a margin loan commitment letter from Morgan Stanley for $12.5 billion in margin loans. And Musk also got $21billion through equity financing.\n\nBut he has used 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla as collateral in the high-stakes move, which analysts warned could have huge ramifications for the company.\n\nApril 22: Musk posts 'boner' killer picture of Bill Gates on Twitter\n\nMusk dissed Bill Gates' gut on Twitter, posting a photo of the Microsoft mogul next to Apple's controversial pregnant man emoji 'in case you need to lose a boner.'\n\nHe posted a follow-up image in response to the Friday post of six hooded figured captioned 'shadow ban council reviewing Tweet'.\n\nThe joke could further infuriate woke Twitter staffers angered by Musk's ongoing bid to buy the firm after saying he would support free speech.\n\nThat is because the pregnant man emoji is aimed at being inclusive to transgender people - with Musk frequently taking aim at what he sees as woke overreach.\n\nApril 25: Musk finalizes deal to buy Twitter\n\nMusk was closing in on seizing Twitter as talks between the Tesla magnate and the tech giant entered their final stages, reports say.\n\nThe tycoon's representatives were said to be hammering out terms including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly working into the early morning to finalize the 'fluid and fast-moving' negotiations.\n\nTwitter shares soared by four percent as the markets opened to $50.84 a share amid reports it would be seized by Musk.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Twitter announced it had 'entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.'", 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/26/14/57069119-0-image-a-49_1650980561815.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:05:10'}

Social media is a critical tool used to share ideas, express opinions, and consume information that has real-life impacts in discourse in the offline world. We should be worried about any powerful central actor, whether it’s a government or any wealthy individual — even if it’s an ACLU member — having so much control over the boundaries of our political speech online.\n\nMusk has stated his intention to take Twitter private, to make its algorithms public, and has made several comments about the platform being necessary to Democracy and freedom of speech.\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com', 'image': 'https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/104579476-GettyImages-489769566.1910x1000-e1612198942847.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:39'}

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:56'}

TWTR -3.91% will need to follow the bloc’s new rules for tackling illegal and harmful content online if it wants to keep operating there, marking a possible challenge to Elon Musk’s plans to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation.\n\nThierry Breton, EU internal market commissioner, said Tuesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it’s his job to make sure companies, including Twitter, understand their obligations in Europe. That will soon include a series of new obligations for social media and other online platforms, called the Digital Services Act, after lawmakers agreed to the main points of the legislation last week.\n\n“Now we have very clear rules,” Mr. Breton said. “They can do whatever they want outside of Europe…but in Europe they will just have to fulfill [our] rules and obligations.”\n\nElon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, moving the world’s richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform. Photo: Ryan Lash/TED Conferences, LLC/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Digital Services Act aims to force platforms to take more responsibility for the content their users post online. It will introduce a series of obligations for large social-media networks like Twitter, ranging from new standards for taking down illegal content to a requirement to conduct annual risk assessments detailing how they are responding to harmful content that is posted online.\n\nThe text of the new law still needs formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries, but it is unlikely to change substantially from what lawmakers agreed to last week.\n\nMr. Breton expressed confidence in a post on Twitter earlier Tuesday that the company under Mr. Musk’s ownership would conform to the EU’s new rules.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,” Mr. Breton wrote. “Mr Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter could mark an eventual test case for the EU’s new legislation once it comes into effect, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. While there are questions about whether the European Commission will have the resources to fully enforce the new law, Prof. Tobias said, “I do think [Mr. Musk] is on notice, and Twitter shareholders, too.”\n\nMr. Musk wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that his view of free speech is speech that “matches the law.”\n\n“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he said. “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.”\n\nMr. Breton said the EU was careful in setting its regulations to maintain freedom of speech. He said he had interactions with many platforms during the lawmaking process and was open to meeting with others, in a comment that appeared to be aimed at Mr. Musk. “If any new shareholder of these platforms is willing to engage with me, my door will be totally open, like always,” he said.\n\nThe EU’s new legislation won’t prevent Mr. Musk from taking a more free-speech-oriented approach, said Zach Meyers, a senior research fellow with the Centre for European Reform think tank. However, he said Twitter will still need to comply with rules on the removal of illegal content, which would likely require hiring more people to deal with content moderation and complaints.\n\nElon Musk and Twitter More coverage of the billionaire's bid for Twitter, selected by editors Latest Developments\n\nWrite to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-531712/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:47'}

The world\'s wealthiest man offered to buy the social media site for $44 billion, and the company\'s board accepted the offer yesterday.\n\nMusk has many reasons for buying the company, but his main drive appears to be to preserve—or even strengthen—the site\'s commitment to the principles of free speech.\n\n"Twitter is the digital town square, where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," tweeted Musk.\n\nAdmittedly, the town square analogy is imperfect, as my colleague Liz Wolfe highlighted in her excellent post on the subject. For one thing, Twitter is a private company, rather than a genuinely public space, which means that it is not bound by the First Amendment. Unlike the actual town square, Twitter retains the right to punish users for perfectly legal speech. It\'s also the case that while Twitter is incredibly important for the political class, journalists, business leaders, and other social influencers, it\'s not nearly as big or as frequently visited as Facebook, YouTube, or TikTok. As Techdirt\'s Mike Masnick put it, the entire internet is really the town square; Twitter is one small space that\'s part of it.\n\nTwitter\'s social importance is inflated by media and political figures because the site is their preferred virtual meeting ground. This is true of Musk himself; he clearly enjoys the platform, and uses it to great effect, and thus may be overstating its importance to society. But there are many others ways to communicate political messages, and if Twitter ceased to exist tomorrow, it\'s doubtful that anyone\'s ability to speak would be irreparably harmed.\n\nAdmittedly, the people really overstating Twitter\'s importance are actually Musk\'s critics in progressive and mainstream media. And boy are they overstating it: Current Affairs Editor in Chief Nathan Robinson fretted that "the only comforting reason to think [former President] Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable."\n\nThe only comforting reason to think Donald Trump might not win in 2024 is that his prior success was so dependent on his Twitter account. If Musk takes over it\'s very likely that Trump will be back and therefore unstoppable. — Nathan J Robinson (@NathanJRobinson) April 25, 2022\n\nRobinson apparently thinks that Trump\'s ability to win reelection hinges on whether he\'s on Twitter. Not the shape of the U.S. economy, the direction of the pandemic, or whether President Joe Biden\'s ill-considered policies have created an opening for the former president…but Twitter.\n\nFrustratingly, many liberals and progressives—especially in the media—have convinced themselves that the only way to effectively counter bad speech is to label it misinformation or harassment and prevent it from being uttered. This runs counter to Musk\'s stated views on the subject, which reflect classically liberal ideas about speech.\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nIt\'s strange to see this idea—that silencing opponents is not only self-defeating but also wrong on principle—transformed into an explicitly right-wing talking point. This is a demoralizing result of the new political reality, in which the journalists and bureaucrats who comprise Team Blue fear and distrust speech they cannot control, while Team Red purports to love free speech even as its political figures wage war on speech they do not like. And it\'s one that does not work to Democrats\' advantage; as Nate Silver points out, free speech in the abstract is extremely popular among the voting public.\n\nThe best way to de-politicize the social media free speech debate—and the optimal thing that Musk could do with control of Twitter—would be to devolve content curation to individual users, as I explained in The Los Angeles Times:\n\n"Elon Musk\'s best bet would be to devolve content curation to individual users. Many on the right are frustrated with Twitter\'s inconsistently applied rules, regardless of whether they are enforced by algorithms or by human employees of the company; many progressives, on the other hand, are afraid that lax moderation means more misinformation or harassment. The least polarizing way forward is to give users more means of controlling their own feeds. If you have a low tolerance for unpleasantness, you should be able to turn on a setting that shields you from the worst of what can appear on the platform. If you prefer the Wild West, there should be a setting for you, too."\n\nIn any case, I hope that fixing Twitter doesn\'t distract Musk from his far more important goal of colonizing Mars (something NPR criticized as imperialist, because of course they did).

Musk haters have taken to the site to declare that Donald Trump will now probably win the 2024 election, that Musk\'s bid is really about white power, that Section 230 must be reformed, and that, yes, Musk\'s new policies will be lethal. (Perhaps the death toll will be even larger than net neutrality\'s!)\n\nSo, for users of the platform, what\'s likely to change?\n\nMusk has panned the site\'s existing content moderation policies, saying they are too restrictive and encroach on people\'s ability to speak freely without being censored. Some liberalization of these policies and the re-platforming of controversial figures like former President Donald Trump—who was banned in the wake of the January 6 riot for inciting violence among his fans—seems likely, though unpopular with droves of users.\n\nAt the mid-April TED conference in Vancouver, Musk talked about his interest in making Twitter\'s algorithm open-source. The Diff\'s Byrne Hobart took this a step further, outlining how "Twitter should monetize a protocol rather than run an app," and explaining the tension between Twitter as a consumer product and as "a way for individual users to update a universal shared database, which can then be filtered based on who\'s interested in what." Hobart claims that it\'s possible that Twitter has been "radically miss-monetized," and that Musk could potentially realign its priorities. However, little of the online discourse has focused on the technical possibilities.\n\nThe new Twitter owner has, through coy tweets, hinted that his new policies will not be applied arbitrarily and that consistent application will mean some number of right-wing users currently cheering his new ownership will surely be disappointed:\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nA social media platform\'s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2022\n\nElsewhere, Musk has said that Twitter is a "town square" or "public square," and that banning people from using the platform effectively prevents them from participating in the important discussions of the day.\n\nThough people who care about fostering a culture of free speech may agree with the tenor of Musk\'s comments, the analogy is a terrible one. For most of America, the public square is the school board meeting and the town council meeting. There are also numerous other privates spaces for civic engagement: the church pulpit and the post-sermon fray it inspires; neighborhood listservs and the cesspool that is NextDoor; or maybe it\'s Facebook, in-person conversations, and email lists. For many millions of Americans, Twitter is not integral to hashing out values, concerns, and disagreements. Think of the implications if we expected the government to treat such companies—which have their own terms of service and standards that they are free to decide and we are free to consent to—as something akin to public utilities.\n\nIf anything, the new owner of a social media company should convey an inflated sense of the platform\'s worth! But Musk has at times, despite his forceful defense of free speech culture on the internet, repeated confused talking points that indicate scattered thinking while simultaneously failing to fully flesh out what day-to-day operations will look like. For example, a lot of content moderation involves the unsexy—and not very ideological—challenge of keeping spam under control. And, as Mike Masnick points out at Techdirt, Musk doesn\'t seem to have a particularly robust understanding of "hate speech" and how much of what we call hate speech is, in fact, protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA lot remains to be seen about how Twitter will change and what Musk will bring to the table. Optimism, with some reservations about Musk\'s ability to execute, seems warranted. Hysteria—like declaring that it\'s now open season for white supremacists, that Musk\'s vision for free speech will be "lethal," or that Musk is an echo of imperialist, colonizer forebears because he wants to go to Mars—is not.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/04/thumbnail-9-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:39'}

It’s not your rules which will apply here.’”\n\nHe went on to warn that companies in breach of the new rules, expected to come into force in 2024, can face fines of up to 6% of global turnover and outright bans for repeat offenders.\n\nThe act will require social media platforms to allow users to flag illegal content – such as promotion of terrorism or commercial scams – in an “easy and effective way” so that it can be swiftly removed.\n\nBe it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules – regardless of their shareholding.\n\n\n\nMr Musk knows this well.\n\n\n\nHe is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.#DSA — Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) April 26, 2022\n\nMusk responded to the EU and UK announcements on Tuesday, tweeting: “The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all.”\n\nHe later showed signs of willingness to adhere to regulations: “By ‘free speech’, I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.\n\n“If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”\n\nBreton spoke as human rights groups reacted to the Twitter board accepting Musk’s bid with warnings of damaging consequences if the billionaire’s commitment to free speech results in a loosening of restrictions on harmful content.\n\nAmnesty International said it was concerned about any decision that Twitter may take after Musk’s takeover to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to moderate hate speech online.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others,” Michael Kleinman, director of technology and human rights at Amnesty International USA,\n\nDeborah Brown, a digital rights researcher and advocate at Human Rights Watch, said even small changes to the platform could have a devastating impact.\n\nThe UK is also introducing a tougher regulatory regime for digital platforms with the online safety bill, which requires businesses such as Twitter and Facebook to protect users from harmful content and carries the threat of fines of up to 10% of global turnover for breaches.\n\nImran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a campaign group, said: “The UK and the EU are going to have tools to deal with this. Twitter is going to find it very difficult to operate in the UK if it tries to operate on a completely free speech, zero-rules basis.”\n\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has backed Musk takeover of the micro-blogging platform, describing the billionaire as “the singular solution I trust”.\n\nThe 45-year-old, who co-founded the company in 2006 and floated it on the New York Stock Exchange in 2013, said it has been “owned” by Wall Street and that Musk’s deal struck on Monday to take it private was the “correct first step”.\n\nHowever, Dorsey, who stepped down as Twitter chief executive in November and will receive a $978m payout for his 2.4% stake when the deal is completed later this year, said that ultimately “in principle I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter”.\n\nParag Agrawal, who took over from Dorsey as chief executive, has told staff that their jobs are only safe for about the six months it will take to get the deal done.\n\n"He\'s more powerful than countries now," said Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor $tsla $twtr https://t.co/0sc0XOtOW4 — Ross Gerber (@GerberKawasaki) April 25, 2022\n\nDonald Trump, who was permanently banned from Twitter after the US Capitol riots last January, has said he would not return to the platform even if Musk allowed him.

It is only a matter of time.\n\nDidn’t Trump literally just say he won’t rejoin Twitter?\n\nTrump also repeatedly insisted the coronavirus was “under control” in early 2020, and we all know how that turned out.\n\nSo watch this space! Trump feeds on attention and will once again disseminate his cries through Twitter’s unholy megaphone, just not right away. For the moment, it’s more expedient for Trump to promote his social network, which I promise virtually nobody will ever ever use. As of early April, TRUTH reportedly had just north of 500,000 daily active users, paling in comparison to Twitter’s 217 million or so DAUs, as Vanity Fair pointed out yesterday. Sure, the former president has the power to juice an app’s ranking for, say, a few weeks, but check back in a year and you’ll see what I mean.\n\nBut looking ahead, when Trump’s 2024 campaign kicks into high gear, do you think he’ll choose loyalty to TRUTH Social, of all things, over Twitter and its outsized media reach? No. Trump is not loyal to anything. Given the chance, he will return. Next question.\n\nHow can we know Musk will lift the ban? He hasn’t said anything, has he?\n\nMusk has said enough, but please, allow me a moment to backtrack.\n\nWhen Twitter banned Trump, some of the president’s thirstiest supporters protested the move in defense of “free speech,” arguing that the safeguard against government overreach should also cover drivel on Twitter’s website. This is absurd, but Musk’s views on free speech and content moderation pretty much jive with their outlook, and conservatives know it. (Personally, I’d rather build a hospitable town square that people want to visit, versus one that celebrates these weirdos, but that wouldn’t be very Twitter, would it?)\n\nInstead of wading into the nitty gritty of content moderation, for example, Musk seemingly wants to feel it out and hopes even his “worst critics” stick around to post. If that’s what he’s focused on, then why wouldn’t he also welcome Rosie O’Donnell’s worst critic back into the fold?\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022\n\nAt least Jack trusts Elon, right?\n\nIt sure sounds like he does! Not long after Twitter’s board accepted Musk’s offer, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey spoke up in support of the website’s incoming acquirer. After a strong caveat that, “in principal,” he does not “believe anyone should own or run Twitter,” Dorsey said that “Elon is the singular solution I trust” when it comes to “solving for the problem of it being a company.” And believe me, you can trust Musk — to singularly shrug and subject us to @RealDonaldTrump all over again.\n\nTwitter’s decision to ban Trump in the first place came down to just two tweets, and hinged primarily on their timing and context following the January 6 riot. That’s shaky ground to begin with. Add in Musk’s management and posting ideology, which is not compatible with fussy concepts such as nuance, and baby, you’ve got a stew going. Instead, the serial CEO is far too busy union busting, hating on critics and doing things for the lolz to concern himself with ideals like community health or treating people with dignity.', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229173793.jpg?w=600', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:05'}

Musk paid $44 billion to acquire the social media platform with the stated aim of turning it into a haven for "free speech."\n\nThe web is awash in speculation over what that means. Conservatives and people booted off the platform have pushed for Musk to reinstate banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent Twitter figures are now saying they\'ll leave the platform in protest of its new owner. Among them is English actress Jameela Jamil, who tweeted her fears Monday that Musk "is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, bigotry, and misogyny."\n\nIt\'s unclear whether Musk will be able to realize all his plans for Twitter. The tech leader has floated less moderation, less advertising and an open-source algorithm. But Musk\'s stated ideals contradict his own actions.\n\nWhat Musk says he wants\n\nMusk has made clear he wants less moderation — which he considers censorship — on the platform.\n\n"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said in Monday\'s announcement about the acquisition.\n\nHe also said he wants to defeat the "spambots," or automated accounts that mimic real users; open the algorithm to public inspection and "authenticate all humans" using the platform.\n\nMusk laid out a definition of speech in a TED interview last week.\n\n"A good sign as to whether there is free speech is, is someone you don\'t like allowed to say something you don\'t like? If that is the case, we have free speech," he said.\n\nMusk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he\'d be "very reluctant" to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company\'s rules.\n\nHe had previously criticized Trump\'s ban from social media in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Twitter and Facebook permanently banned Trump\'s account on the grounds that he incited violence.\n\n"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech," Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHow Musk responds to disagreement\n\nMusk\'s own history, however, puts in doubt his commitment to let people he doesn\'t like speak. As the newsletter Popular Information has documented, Musk has regularly blocked users who criticize him or Tesla; threatened pro-union Tesla employees and company whistleblowers; and has aggressively gone after short-sellers and journalists who are critical of Tesla, sometimes calling their work "false" or "misleading."\n\nIn 2018, he launched a vendetta against Linette Lopez, an Insider journalist critical of Tesla, a move which writer Felix Salmon called "obsessive and deranged."\n\nMusk\'s popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\nSome academics say that Musk\'s hands-off approach threatens to bring Twitter to its bad old days, when harassment and abuse were rampant.\n\n"With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself," said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. "If you stop moderating — with automated systems and human reviews — a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool."\n\nSome former Twitter employees are also dismayed by Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n"Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform," said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts shared by others about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n"I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting," Miley said. "He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter."\n\nUnfettered expression does not attract advertisers\n\nA decade ago, a Twitter executive called the company "the free speech wing of the free speech party," underscoring its commitment to untrammeled freedom of expression. But the company reversed itself after reports of online abuse and harassment became frequent.\n\nIn the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums. Twitter also learned about the consequences of an unmoderated social platform: mainly, that it undercut their funding from advertisers.\n\nAds are how Twitter makes money, and companies generally don\'t want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement or incendiary information aimed at tipping elections or undermining public health.\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the "health" of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the "report abuse" button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy\'s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invest in staff and technology that detected violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violated its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used Twitter\'s platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies stepped up their efforts against political misinformation. All have struggled with defining "misinformation," however, and been accused of both leaving up false content as well as over-censoring legitimate posts.\n\nHard to unwind moderation\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nLike Miley, the former Twitter engineer, experts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter express doubt that Musk knows what he is getting into. After all, there are plenty of fledgling examples of so-called free speech-focused platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter alternatives, largely by conservatives unhappy with the Twitter\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation. Many such sites have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n"This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power," said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. "I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter\'s values."\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk\'s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n"This platform is pretty much the same one we\'ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You\'ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they\'ve had trouble. It\'s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway."\n\nEven now, Americans say they\'re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a "fair or poor" job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/30/39aaad79-fd57-40fa-b203-bc4143cf40f2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/aef00fb0dcf931880dd52af0a50dc345/gettyimages-1206290121.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:59'}

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country.

However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 0 have signed the petition.

After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular amongst Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end, but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even amongst his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nPresently we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remember that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment after years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared to Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://www.lifesitenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1354093065.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:44'}

Jody Hice (R-Ga.), in all caps. A Twitter survey by Sen. Ted Cruz asked if Musk’s purchase was a good thing, with the only options to answer being “yes” or “no, I hate free speech.” His fellow Texan, Rep. John Carter, signaled his approval with no words at all; three clapping-hands emojis were sufficient.\n\nA pot-smoking, meme-posting evangelist for electric vehicles may be an unlikely hero for conservatives. But the Tesla chief executive’s amorphous vow to restore free speech to the social media platform has resonated among Republicans, who see themselves — starting with their de facto leader, former President Trump — as unfairly targeted by Twitter’s content moderation efforts.\n\nConservatives said their euphoric outpouring was bigger than the possible return of @RealDonaldTrump and changes to Twitter’s ownership. Rather, they see Musk’s takeover as a symbolic, and cathartic, blow against Big Tech, which the right has increasingly viewed with antipathy.\n\n“There’s a gut reaction from a lot of people, going, ‘You know what, it’s about time they get their comeuppance,’ ” said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). “It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself — if you are a conservative.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk centered his bid for Twitter on the premise that the social media company, which he considers a “digital town square,” is too restrictive in clamping down on expression.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk tweeted Monday morning.\n\nMusk’s own politics are idiosyncratic. He’s the foremost face of clean vehicles who called for immediately increasing oil and gas production after the Ukraine-Russia war spiked energy prices. He fled California for Texas because of high taxes but declined to weigh in on Texas’ restrictive abortion law, saying he preferred to “stay out of politics.” He has described himself as politically independent and registered to vote in California with no party preference.\n\nFor conservatives, Musk’s crusade against content restrictions has struck a chord. Roughly half of Republicans feel they cannot express themselves freely on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted this month, far exceeding the percentage of Democrats and independents who felt similarly.\n\nPolitics Who did Twitter ban during the Trump era, and why? Could banned Trump allies return to Twitter under Elon Musk? A look at the former president’s backers who were kicked off the social media platform.\n\n“Twitter is a platform that I and many others believe has been more aggressive in blocking Republicans and conservatives than they have toward people on the left,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). “I’m hoping and expecting he will undo that.”\n\nScott is not an avid Twitter user; he does not even have the app on his phone. But he did tweet a congratulatory message to Musk, adding a plea to “restore free speech and bring back President Trump!”\n\nTrump was permanently kicked off the platform on Jan. 8, 2021 — two days after a group of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the certification of Joe Biden’s win. Twitter imposed the ban “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”\n\nSo far, Musk has not indicated how he’d handle the former president’s account. Trump, meanwhile, has shown no interest in rejoining the platform that helped power his political rise and gave real-time narration of his presidency.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News, referring to his fledgling social media network. “I hope Elon buys Twitter, because he’ll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nRepublicans see Trump as just one example of Twitter’s bias. A number of high-profile conservatives have been suspended or blocked from the platform, including the account of the Babylon Bee, a satirical news website that was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who is transgender, “Man of the Year.”\n\nThe account was locked as a violation of Twitter’s ban on hate speech. Seth Dillon, CEO of Babylon Bee, refused to remove the tweet, asserting that “truth is not hate speech.”\n\n“It’s completely broken,” said Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer who has sued Twitter multiple times on behalf of clients who were banned. “The company can try to affect elections, try to ban politicians from speaking ... use algorithms, enable false accounts to constantly affect what people see.”\n\nThe extent to which conservatives face bias on the platform has been fiercely examined and debated. A study this month by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats but that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would provoke such suspensions.\n\nSo far, Musk has offered little explanation as to how his free speech values would play out in practice. He said on Monday that his goals include “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.”\n\nBut such efforts would require some attempt at regulating content, especially by verifying users. A social media network without any moderation at all could swamp the platform with all sorts of unsavory or offensive material, such as pornography or terrorist content, as well as the online abuse and harassment that are already common occurrences.\n\n“If you don’t have content moderation, you actually have less free speech. The people who are the loudest are the bullies and harassers that drive people away,” said Katie Harbath, a former Republican operative who has worked as public policy director for Facebook.\n\nDhillon, the conservative attorney based in California, said she is not hoping for Musk to completely abandon regulation.\n\n“There’s plenty of room for them to do old-school content moderation of the kind they originally did,” she said, citing as an example prohibitions on making death threats.\n\nWith Musk’s plans still unknown, Harbath, who now runs a tech policy strategy firm, said the celebratory conservatives “are making a hell of a lot of assumptions of what Elon means by all this stuff. I don’t think they should assume he is completely on their side.”\n\nRepublicans’ triumphant tone on Twitter starkly contrasted with the more muted reaction from liberal politicians. Far fewer Democratic members of Congress weighed in on Twitter, although those who did were markedly unenthused.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Musk has sparred on Twitter.\n\nHuizenga, the Michigan congressman, expected that liberals would be none too pleased with Musk’s purchase. Indeed, some vowed to leave the site entirely — much to Huizenga’s amusement.\n\n“It seems like ‘I’m quitting Twitter’ has become the ‘I’m moving to Canada if Trump wins,’ ” he said, adding, “It’s kind of fun sitting back, watching them completely lose their collective minds.”', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac14b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2941x1544+0+208/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F23%2Ff46440b54bd7a6509db9c67caab5%2Fphilanthropy-billionaries-tax-28080.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

(Patrick Pleul/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk Reveals More Details of His Plans for Twitter After Buyout\n\nElon Musk revealed more details of what he has in mind for changes at Twitter after it was confirmed that the company had accepted his buyout offer, with the tech mogul’s plans including new features and ways to enhance trust in the platform.\n\nTwitter’s board of directors said on April 25 that it had approved Musk’s offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, in a deal worth around $44 billion.\n\nThe buyout represents a 38 percent premium over Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1, with Parag Agrawal, CEO of Twitter, saying in a statement that he believes the deal “is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\n‘Bedrock of a Functioning Democracy’\n\nIn a statement, Musk provided some details about what kind of changes he has in mind for the social media platform, whose commitment to free speech he has repeatedly called into question.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said. This dovetails with his earlier statements that Twitter functions as a “de facto town square” where important conversations should be able to take place with as few constraints as possible.\n\nMusk said Monday that Twitter has “tremendous potential” and that he wants to work with the company and its users to “unlock” and make the platform “better than ever.”\n\nHe said he plans on “enhancing” Twitter with new features, which he did not provide further details on. Musk earlier created a Twitter poll asking users if they want an edit button on the platform, suggesting that this could be one of the changes he is seeking to effect.\n\nMusk also said on Monday he wants to make the platform’s algorithms “open source to increase trust,” while “defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nThis, too, reinforces his earlier remarks that his objective in seeking to buy Twitter and turn it into a private company was to transform it into a bastion of free speech by opening up its algorithm to public scrutiny and by making its moderation policies more transparent.\n\n‘Black Box Algorithm’\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk told the audience at a recent TED event in Vancouver, Canada, that Twitter should permit unconstrained expression, though it should do so in line with the law.\n\n“In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said, acknowledging reasonable legal caps on free speech like direct incitement to violence or shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\n“But going beyond that and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what’s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,” Musk said.\n\n“My strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” he added.\n\nErr on Side of Free Speech\n\nMusk also expressed reluctance about permanent bans of users from Twitter, preferring instead temporary “time-outs.”\n\n“I’m not saying that I have all the answers here,” Musk said at the TED talk. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans.”\n\nIn terms of calibrating Twitter’s moderation policies, Musk said he’d want to err on the side of free speech.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech, let it exist,” Musk said. “If it’s a grey area, I would say let the tweet exist. But obviously in a case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, that you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet.”\n\n“A good sign as to whether there’s free speech is, is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like,” Musk said. “And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\n‘We Are Concerned’\n\nMusk has repeatedly questioned Twitter’s commitment to free speech, after accusations that the platform suppressed some minority and politically conservative viewpoints, claims Twitter has denied.\n\nMany free speech advocates have hailed Musk’s takeover bid, while those opposed have expressed fear that fewer constraints on expression on Twitter will make it too easy to abuse the platform’s reach and power by, for example, spreading disinformation.\n\nIn a series of tweets reacting to Musk’s takeover moves, Amnesty International expressed concern about the erosion of policies meant to protect users.\n\n“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users,” Amnesty International wrote.\n\n“The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users,” the group said.\n\nAs it was confirmed Musk would purchase Twitter, the Tesla founder urged his “worst critics” to stay on the platform.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users will take a “wait-and-see approach” on whether they stay or leave the platform, based on the changes that take place.\n\n“Now it’s about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,” Ives told the outlet.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/19/article-image-cal-thomas-3-1200x804.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:50'}

McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he “never did,” redirecting attention to the border.\n\n“What’s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what’s happening here right now,” McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden’s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n“This is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,” McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n“But right now, he’s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, ‘We should not lift Title 42,’ ” McCarthy said. “They’re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.”\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as “absolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.”\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n“Your failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,” said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration’s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday’s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a “great business partner to the cartels,” and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in “countless” town halls.\n\n“Don’t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,” Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n“Biden bears responsibility for this. I don’t see how he sleeps well at night,” Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n“If we’d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn’t have that loss of life,” Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n“In 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,” McCarthy said. “And then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.”', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/mccarthykevin_mayorkasalejandro_042522gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:22'}

Administration officials have ruled out detaining migrant families with children, telling reporters Tuesday the practice started under President Barack Obama and expanded under President Donald Trump "is not a tool we are considering now."\n\nThe planned expansion of expedited removal could be restricted by some countries\' refusal to accept U.S. deportations. An administration official said the U.S. is hoping to forge new repatriation collaboration agreements with certain countries that would cut red tape for carrying out deportations.\n\nU.S. officials have historically struggled to return large numbers of migrants to certain countries like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela due to strained relations with their respective governments.

"But the Bureau of Prisons is going to make buses available for the transfers that Border Patrol needs assistance for. And the Marshall Service is going to be providing additional deputy U.S. Marshals to assist CBP at the border."\n\nThe Defense Department, meanwhile, will provide "rapid contracting support for air and ground transportation," according to a senior administration official, in addition to identifying potential locations for new temporary migrant holding facilities along the southwest border.\n\nOfficials also noted the Department of National Intelligence is "coordinating intelligence gathering and helping to support and strengthen our capability to get an early warning of migrant surges as they are building."\n\nDHS plans to expand the distribution of "age-appropriate" COVID-19 vaccines to migrants at two dozen CBP sites by May 23, in addition to its existing vaccination program for those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.\n\nOfficials also confirmed that MaryAnn Tierney, the regional administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will soon transition out of her short-lived role, where she led the newly established "Southwest Border Coordination Center." The center was established in February, and Mayorkas appointed Tierney shortly thereafter.

Asked by co-anchor Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” about the rise, Jha said the nation should react to the increasing infections differently now compared to one year ago because the U.S. now has vaccines, booster shots and therapeutics.

Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the administration, argued there was no way the government could detain so many asylum seekers for months or years. She cited a report that said there were 220,000 migrants apprehended at or near the border in March but only 32,000 beds in detention facilities.\n\n“No one disputes that the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] does not have sufficient detention capacity” to hold all those migrants, she said.\n\nThe government’s only reasonable option, she said, was to release most of them if they are judged likely to return when their asylum claim is due to be heard.\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh questioned whether that’s what Congress intended. Is there any hint “that anyone in Congress expected that if there was not sufficient detention capacity that hundreds of thousands of people would be paroled into the United States without being lawfully admitted?” he asked.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. agreed the administration’s position would permit unlimited number of migrants to be admitted and released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There aren’t enough beds in detention. So there is no limit, as you read the statute, to the number of people that you can release into the United States, right?” he told the solicitor general.\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration chose a different option and sent many of the Central American migrants back to the Mexican side of the border. Its officials did so believing the move would deter more migrants from traveling north.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argued that Trump’s policy was cruel and inhumane. They said it forced tens of thousands of people from Central America to live in squalid conditions subject to violence and abuse. Upon taking office, President Biden said he planned to repeal Trump’s policy.\n\nBut state lawyers for Texas and Missouri sued and last year won nationwide orders from judges that required the new administration to maintain the prior Trump policy. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order in the Texas case.\n\nIn August of last year, the justices by a 6-3 vote refused an emergency appeal seeking to overturn the judge’s orders. And there was no clear sign during Tuesday’s argument the majority will do so now.\n\nTraditionally, the court has given the executive branch broad authority to enforce the immigration laws, including reversing the policies of prior administrations.\n\nPrelogar said it would be a radical departure for the court to say the new administration must maintain the new policies put in place by the prior administration. Prior to 2019, no administration or member of Congress had asserted the immigration law required the government to detain every noncitizen who had a pending asylum claim, she said.\n\nBut lurking in the background is the long legal fight over DACA, the Obama-era policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. President Obama used his authority under the immigration laws to suspend enforcement against young people who were brought illegally to this country when they were children.\n\nTrump moved to repeal that policy, but judges in California and New York put the repeal on hold. Lawyers for Trump argued the new president had ample authority to revoke a discretionary enforcement policy adopted by Obama.\n\nTwo years ago, however, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote ruled against Trump and blocked the repeal.\n\nNow in the case of Biden vs. Texas, the justices will rule on whether the new administration is free to repeal Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy.\n\nA decision can be expected by late June.', 'image': 'https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f7a67b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2Fde%2Fa50bba424e1eb301ca3265187af2%2F914957-na-pol-0210-supreme-court-kkn-11150.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:48'}

The public health order, which has been used by both the Biden and Trump administrations to expel a majority of migrants at the border due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will end on May 23.\n\nRepublicans and moderate Democrats have sounded the alarm about a massive surge in migration at the border on top of the already sky-high numbers that the administration has itself called "historic." DHS has been planning for up to 18,000 migrants a day and the current March numbers of 210,000 a month are expected to increase in the months ahead.\n\nDemocratic senators in particular have called for the Biden administration to have a plan in place before Title 42 is lifted and have introduced legislation in an attempt to make the administration implement such a plan. DHS has protested that it does, in fact, have a plan for the coming surge.\n\nThe six-step plan released by the administration involves the surging of resources, including medical support and transportation to the border, as well as initiatives to streamline the processing of migrants from the border to their release into the interior of the United States.\n\nHowever, the agency claims it is also administering consequences for unlawful entry, including the use of Expedited Removal (ER), which can allow for the rapid removal of recently arrived illegal immigrants. However, Border Patrol agents have told Fox News that if a migrant claims they have a fear of persecution, the removal order is changed to a Notice to Appear – meaning they are released into the United States with a future court date.\n\nThey said that migrants are already spreading the word about what to say to get released into the U.S. as the administration has already been increased its use of ER to remove illegal immigrants from Northern Triangle countries.\n\nA senior administration official, in a call with reporters, said there was no plan to use family detention as a way to help deal with the surge. However, the use of ER would allow for the use of detention for single adults. The administration has also stressed that it intends to remove "promptly" those who are allowed in, go through immigration proceedings, and are found not to have a valid asylum case.\n\nThe other pillars of the administration’s plan includes bolstering the capacity of non-governmental organizations to receive migrants after they’ve been processed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). NGOs often help migrants with travel, housing and other assistance after they are released.\n\nFinally, the administration say it will target and disrupt transnational criminal organizations who facilitate illegal immigration, and also deter illegal migration throughout the Hemisphere. It pointed to new migration agreements with Panama and Costa Rica, as well as "close cooperation with Mexico."\n\n"We are also sending a clear message in the region to counteract misinformation from smugglers, including that the termination of the Title 42 public health Order does not mean that the U.S. border is open," the memo says.\n\n58-MEMBER BIPARTISAN HOUSE PROBLEM SOLVERS CAUCUS BACKS BILL TO EXTEND TITLE 42\n\nMayorkas ends the memo by admitting that the migrant surge will "substantially strain" resources at the border, and instead calls on Congress to pass solutions to fix what the administration has claimed is a "broken" system.\n\n"Despite the efforts of our dedicated DHS workforce and our partners executing this comprehensive plan, a significant increase in migrant encounters will substantially strain our system even further," he says.\n\n"As it has since its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that holistically addresses the root causes of migration, strengthens border security, fixes our immigration system, and improves legal pathways," the memo says.\n\nThat legislation was quickly rejected by Republicans early last year due to its inclusion of a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants in the country, combined with a lack of border security measures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublican states have sued the Biden administration in a bid to stop the order being lifted on May 23. The states won a temporary restraining order on Monday as the case proceeds, although details of the order are not clear.\n\nThe 21 states are hoping to secure a preliminary injunction barring the lifting of the order after a hearing on May 13.', 'image': 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1358276236.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

Texas, is the decision last year by President Biden\'s appointees to suspend and ultimately end the policy, which the Trump administration utilized to require 70,000 Latin American migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum requests were reviewed.\n\nFormally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, the Trump administration scaled back the rule at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mr. Biden ordered it ended upon taking office. In August 2021, Republican officials in Texas convinced a federal judge to order U.S. border officials to reinstate the program.\n\nIn his ruling, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, U.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, said the administration did not adequately justify Remain in Mexico\'s termination and that the policy\'s end led officials to violate a 1996 law that requires the detention of certain migrants. The Biden administration has been implementing the policy since December, albeit in a limited fashion.\n\nThe justices on Tuesday expressed concern about whether Texas should be able to dictate federal policy involving foreign diplomacy and acknowledged that officials can\'t logistically detain all border-crossers. But the justices also questioned whether the administration has the authority to release large groups of migrants instead of detaining them or returning them to Mexico.\n\nThe Justice Department, which asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case on an expedited basis, argued Tuesday that the executive branch has broad authority to rescind policies enacted by previous administrations, especially those that implicate foreign relations.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the administration, said the conclusions reached by the lower courts would mean that every U.S. administration has been violating the 1996 migrant detention law since only Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy, and not until early 2019.\n\nPrelogar also noted it is logistically impossible to detain all migrants who reach the U.S.-Mexico border since Congress has only allocated funds for fewer than 40,000 immigration detention beds.\n\n"The secretary should finally be allowed to put his policy decision into effect," Prelogar told the justices, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\' decision to end Remain in Mexico in June 2021.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts told Prelogar he was "sympathetic" toward the position that the government can\'t detain all border-crossers. But he questioned whether releasing large groups of migrants complies with federal law.\n\n"You\'re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law," Roberts said. "But in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\'s still our job to say what the law is."\n\nA group of migrant families from Central America walk alongside the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico after crossing into the U.S. near the city of Sasabe, Arizona, on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTexas\' Solicitor General Judd Stone, however, argued that federal law generally requires U.S. border officials to either detain or return migrants to Mexico. If the U.S. cannot detain migrants because of capacity limits, he argued, it should be returning them to Mexico so they can wait there for the duration of their asylum cases.\n\nJudd acknowledged the government\'s inability to detain all migrants, but said Remain in Mexico\'s enforcement ensures there are "fewer" violations of the 1996 detention law at the center of the case. He said the policy mitigates concerns about detention limits because it deters migrants from crossing the border and in turn, leads to fewer migrants entering U.S. custody.\n\nThe specific questions the Supreme Court considered are whether it should overturn the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals\' conclusion that officials need to enforce Remain in Mexico to comply with the 1996 migrant detention law, and whether the appeals court should have considered the Biden administration\'s second attempt to end the policy. The high court could issue a ruling this summer.\n\nIn its ruling in December upholding the original order against Remain in Mexico\'s termination, the 5th Circuit rejected the argument that a second termination memo by Mayorkas remedied the alleged legal defects of his first termination memo.\n\n"DHS claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet," the court said in its scathing opinion.\n\nSince reinstating the rule in December, the Biden administration has enrolled 3,012 migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, most of them asylum-seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, DHS data show. During that period, U.S. officials along the southern border have processed migrants over 700,000 times.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has sought to end the Remain in Mexico rules, his administration kept another Trump-era border policy, known as Title 42, that has allowed U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants without screening them for asylum due to the pandemic. Title 42 is set to expire in late May.\n\nThe Trump administration\'s implementation of Remain in Mexico elicited strong criticism from advocates for migrants, who said the rule left asylum-seekers at the mercy of criminal groups in dangerous Mexican border towns. Human Rights First, a U.S. group, reported hundreds of cases of migrants being kidnapped, assaulted or otherwise harmed after their return to Mexico.\n\nAdvocates also said the program trampled on the due process of asylum-seekers. Fewer than 800 migrants enrolled in the Remain in Mexico protocols were granted U.S. refuge, while tens of thousands lost their cases or were ordered deported for missing court dates, an analysis of government data by Syracuse University\'s TRAC project shows.\n\nBut Trump administration officials said the program effectively reduced border arrivals by preventing migrants fleeing economic hardship from using the asylum system to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe Biden administration made significant changes to its iteration of the Remain in Mexico program, including by requiring U.S. border officials to ask migrants whether they fear being harmed in Mexico before sending them there.\n\nThe administration has also offered COVID-19 vaccines to prospective enrollees and expanded the categories of asylum-seekers deemed to be too vulnerable to be returned to Mexico, including the elderly, those with medical conditions and members of the LGBTQ community.', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/26/a7750838-5c2c-4777-9b54-d74c13deb9dc/thumbnail/1200x630g2/95f12f52e2f09710ab3f0c8d30e94f75/gettyimages-1240238081.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:42'}

The announcement set off a firestorm that has only spread since then as a growing number of moderate Democrats, traditional allies and key chairmen have distanced themselves from the decision.\n\nThe administration has defended the move, and Mayorkas, during a CBS News interview last week, pledged that his department has a plan to respond to an expected increase in the number of migrants at the border.\n\n“The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact,” Mayorkas said. “We have been planning for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that we might experience upon an end to Title 42.”\n\nBut that’s done little to assuage concerns from congressional Democrats, marking one of the most significant and high-profile breaks between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue during Biden’s tenure.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure that the administration is under, Mayorkas, in addition to his committee testimony, will brief a bipartisan group of lawmakers privately on a call on Tuesday, a source confirmed to The Hill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been critical of the administration’s decision, told The Hill that he hadn’t heard from the administration and remained opposed to lifting Title 42.\n\n“I don’t think Title 42 should be done until we have an immigration bill that works or the pandemic, the COVID, is no longer a threat,” Manchin said.\n\nThe politics are complicated for Democrats.\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released earlier this month found that while only 26 percent of Democrats opposed Biden’s Title 42 decision, 52 percent of independents, the voters Democrats could need to win key Senate battles this November, were against the move.\n\nA Gallup poll released this month, but conducted before the CDC announced that it would roll back the border rule, found that 41 percent of Americans worried a “great deal” about “illegal immigration,” while an additional 19 percent worried a “fair amount” about it.\n\nThat breakdown is skewed along party lines.\n\nOnly 41 percent of Democratic respondents, but 56 percent of independents, said they worried about illegal immigration a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”\n\nRepublicans are eager to use the administration’s Title 42 decision against vulnerable Democrats in November as they view immigration as a key part of their midterm message.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who is facing a progressive primary challenger, told “Fox News Sunday” that the administration’s decision to lift Title 42 has border communities “very concerned.”\n\n“They’re not only public officials but other folks, and none of them said, ‘Yes, go ahead and lift Title 42,’” Cuellar said. “And none of them said, ‘Open up the border.’ They are very concerned because they are on the front lines, and they’re the ones I think we need to listen to.”\n\nThe fight over the border policy has also snagged a separate agreement on $10 billion in coronavirus aid, as Republicans demand a vote to tie Title 42 to the coronavirus assistance.\n\nThe proposal, from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), would effectively block the administration from rescinding the Trump-era rule as long as the broader coronavirus public health emergency remains in place.\n\nDemocrats could defeat Lankford’s amendment if they were unified — but they aren’t. Five Democratic senators have backed the legislation. Republicans believe they would need only a simple majority, meaning the support of one Democratic senator, for it to get added to the coronavirus bill.\n\nAny move by the administration to try to keep Title 42 in place would likely spark fierce pushback from a coalition of Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates who long pushed for Biden to get rid of the Trump-era rule, viewing it as inhumane. Those same Democrats have been frustrated by their colleagues who have criticized rescinding it, arguing that they are mirroring GOP talking points.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) met at the White House with Biden on Monday.\n\n“I made clear to the President and his team that in order to follow through on a promise to create a just and humane immigration system – Title 42 must end on May 23rd and they should be clear that they do not support legislation to extend the end-date,” CHC Deputy Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nThe administration is also facing a legal challenge to its decision to lift the Trump-era rule, raising the prospect that it could get caught up in the courts. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to keep Title 42 in place past May 23.\n\n“I’d like to see a plan from the administration. The courts is separate from what we do here,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), when asked about the court decision.\n\nThe administration is signaling that it’s effectively kicking the question of whether to delay the lifting of the CDC rule, or keep it together, to Congress, which has struggled repeatedly in recent years to reach any consensus on immigration or the border.\n\n“Congress would have to take action in order for the date not to be May 23,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/mayorkasalejandro_092121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:49'}

The pharmacies will be able to order it for free from the federal government, one official said.\n\nThe administration officials said there aren’t currently any plans to expand the pool of those eligible for prescriptions of Paxlovid beyond the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization.\n\nBut the officials hope that getting the antiviral in more pharmacies and talking with doctors will help eliminate a “scarcity mindset” about the drug that has lingered, dating from the months when it was in relatively short supply.\n\nDuring that period, the officials said, many doctors would prescribe Paxlovid to only the sickest patients, instead of anyone who would qualify under the emergency use authorization.\n\nPaxlovid can reduce the “proportion of people with COVID-19 related hospitalization or death from any cause by 88% compared to placebo among patients treated within five days of symptom onset and who did not receive COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatment,” according to the FDA’s statement from December.\n\nThe Biden administration is “in the process of buying 20 million pills of Paxlovid,” as part of the new effort, according to one of the administration officials.\n\n“We have sufficient funding to secure these treatments,” the official continued. “What I think we’re really worried about going forward are future treatments.”\n\nCongress stuck on funding\n\nThe message runs in slight contrast to the Biden administration’s push to get Congress to approve the $22.5 billion in funding.\n\nThe months long delay has led the Biden administration to scale back the number of monoclonal antibodies it sends to state governments by one-third and to end a program providing COVID-19 testing, treatments and vaccines to uninsured people.\n\nWhtie House press secretary Jen Psaki has warned that without more funding from Congress, testing capacity will begin to drop off in June.\n\nShe’s also cautioned that the U.S. government likely wouldn’t have funding to provide free booster shots to all Americans in the event the FDA authorizes and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone get a booster shot later this year.\n\nPsaki said on April 20 that the Biden administration needs additional COVID-19 funding “as soon as possible” because the White House already “had to take steps… like ending our program for the uninsured.”\n\n“We haven’t been able to make purchases that we would normally purchase to get ahead,” Psaki continued during the White House press briefing. “Even on monoclonal antibodies or some of these treatments, some of them take months to make. So it already puts us behind where we need to be and want to be in planning. So, we don’t have a long-term deadline, nor would I punt that out. We want to do it as quickly as possible when they return.”\n\nThe U.S. Senate returned from a two-week spring recess Monday and the U.S. House is set to gavel back into session Tuesday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Monday on the floor that he hopes to reach agreement with Republicans in the coming weeks on the money for COVID-19.\n\n“The longer that Senate Republicans hold out on working with us to approve new funding, the higher the cost will be for our country down the line,” Schumer said. “As we’ve learned already, it doesn’t take much for a new variant to undo a lot of the progress we’ve made in recent months.”\n\nTitle 42\n\nThe disagreement in the Senate isn’t on the bill itself, Schumer and Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney reached a bipartisan agreement for $10 billion earlier this month.\n\nThe debate is over whether Democrats, who control the 50-50 Senate, will allow amendments to the package addressing Title 42.\n\nThe Trump-era designation from the CDC allows border patrol officials to expel migrants, including asylum seekers, at the Southern border as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nThe Biden administration expects to end the program in late May, a decision that many expect will lead to an increase in the number of migrants entering the country.\n\nRepublicans and numerous centrist Democrats have urged the Biden administration to keep the Title 42 designation in place.\n\nBiden, so far, has said he doesn’t plan to do that. But a federal judge in Louisiana said Monday he plans to temporarily block the White House from lifting the designation.\n\nIf Schumer allows a floor vote on a Title 42 amendment it would likely get attached to the COVID-19 spending package, a change to the bill that could doom its ability to pass the U.S. House or lead to Biden vetoing the legislation altogether.\n\nPsaki said Monday evening she didn’t want to comment on whether Biden would veto a bill that changes the rules for how Title 42 is administered.\n\n“There’s a lot of steps between now and then. So, at this point, that’s very premature,” Psaki said. “There are many members who strongly would like to see Title 42 extended. There are many who strongly have the other point of view. So, we are not anywhere near that point in time.”', 'image': 'https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Swab-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:05:07'}

In total, 317 officers of junior lieutenant rank and above have been killed in a little over two months of fighting, analysis by outlet MediaZona revealed today. Almost a third came from the most senior grades - major or above - including at least two generals and the deputy commander of Russia\'s Black Sea fleet. MediaZona, which is currently blocked in Russia but continues to operate online, compiled its data by looking at public reports of troop deaths from local government officials, newspapers, or families posting on social media. That means the figures will be far lower than the true total because of delays between the troops being killed and their deaths being reported, difficulties in identifying bodies, and deliberate cover-ups by Moscow. In total, MediaZona found 1,744 reports of military deaths in Ukraine - higher than the Kremlin\'s official figure of 1,351 which it has not updated since late March. It found 317 of those deaths were of officers, which accounts for almost a fifth of the total figure. MediaZona believes that is because officer deaths are more-likely to be reported than those of foot-soldiers. The highest-ranked deaths that Russia has acknowledged are of Andrei Sukhovetsky and Vladimir Frolov, who were both Major Generals. Russia has also acknowledged the death of Captain 1st Rank Andrei Paly, the deputy commander of its Black Sea fleet, MediaZona said.

Nobody is trying to create it.\'\n\nAmerica did set up a \'deconfliction line\' to Moscow in the early days of the Ukraine war, but said the Russia side stopped answering.\n\nLavrov also repeated warnings that shipments of western weapons into Ukraine will be considered legitimate targets by Russia - a day after missiles struck the country\'s train network in an apparent attempt to stop the deliveries.\n\nhe spoke as western nations shift focus in Ukraine from supplying small arms and defensive weapons such as anti-tank and anti-aricraft missiles, to providing heavier arms such as tanks, helicopters, aircraft and long-range artillery.\n\nThe move comes in response to calls from Kyiv to provide its armed forces with the means to recapture territory occupied by Russian forces, in the wake of atrocities carried out by Putin\'s men in places such as Bucha and Irpin.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin travelled to Kyiv on Sunday for a face-to-face meeting with President Zelensky to discuss supplies, before pledging another multi-million dollar shipment.\n\nAustin will also chair a meeting of more than 40 defence ministers at Ramstein air base in Germany today, aimed at securing additional supplies and coordinating efforts between allies to ensure Ukraine has everything it needs.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Austin stated the goal is to ensure Ukraine \'can win\' the war against Russia and \'weaken\' the country to the point where it cannot repeat its invasion a second time.\n\nAhead of the meeting, German media reported that the country will end weeks of dithering and agree to supply heavy arms to Ukraine in the form of 50 Gepard anti-aircraft systems.\n\nUkraine\'s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday night that he regards Russia\'s scaremongering as a sign of weakness.\n\nLavrov, speaking to Russian state TV, said tensions between east and west are now at a worse point than during the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War\n\nRussia considers western arms shipments to Ukraine legitimate targets for attack, Lavrov added, after the US pledged to send heavier weapons to the country this week (file image)\n\nMaria, 13, holds a photograph of her father Yurii Alekseev, 50, a territorial defence member who according to his family was killed by Russian soldiers, as she mourns him during his funeral today\n\nTetyana Boikiv, 52, right, meets and hugs her neighbour Svitlana Pryimachenko, 48, during a funeral service for her husband, Mykola Moroz\n\nGermany will finally authorise tank deliveries to Ukraine Germany will finally authorise the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine today after weeks of dithering that has tarnished its reputation on the world stage and led to questions about its commitment to European security. Defense minister Christine Lambrecht is expected announce the delivery of around 50 Gepard anti-aircraft vehicles to Ukraine during a meeting of more than 40 nations that will take place at Ramstein air base today. Germany\'s defence industry has been offering to sell the Gepard vehicles to Ukraine since February, but had been blocked from doing so by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government which led to outcry both inside and outside the country. Scholz, whose SPD party traditionally maintains close ties with Russia, had argued that it would take too long to train Ukrainian soldiers to use the weapons, that Germany had no weapons to sell, and that selling weapons could provoke Putin. But under strong pressure from Germany\'s international allies as well as his own coalition partners, Scholz now appears to have decided to change course. Lambrecht will today deliver a speech at Ramstein air base in which she will say the government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks. At the same time, a plan will be submitted to parliament calling for the government to \'continue and, where possible, accelerate the delivery of equipment to Ukraine.\' Equipment will be extended to include \'the delivery [of] heavy weapons and complex systems\', according to a draft of the document shown to AFP. The same document will suggest that Ukrainian soldiers are brought to Germany and other NATO nations so they can be trained how to use the weapons.

I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation,\' Heappey told BBC Television.\n\n\'What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia.\'\n\nHeappey told Sky News that while NATO had been reinforcing its eastern flank, it was not, as an organisation, providing military aid.\n\n\'The donor community is not NATO,\' Heappey said. \'The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid.\'\n\nDuring a visit to Kyiv on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised more military aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Monday used an emergency declaration to approve the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine.\n\nThe Pentagon said the package could include artillery ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.\n\nMoscow\'s ambassador to Washington told the United States to halt shipments, warning Western weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nLavrov said: \'NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy.

The explosions destroyed two powerful Soviet-era radio antennas that were re-broadcasting Russian stations in the region of Transnistria, an unrecognised Moscow-backed sliver of land bordering southwestern Ukraine, on Tuesday. The blasts occurred in the small town of Maiac roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine, just days after a Kremlin military chief warned that \'Russian-speakers\' had been \'oppressed\' there. A day earlier, several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the Ministry of State Security in the city of Tiraspol, the region\'s capital. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said. On Tuesday, a military unit in the village of Parcani was also targeted. Officials did not offer any details on the incident, but declared a \'red level of terrorist threat\' and promised to impose additional security measures in the region.

In the face of mounting sanctions and fierce Ukrainian resistance bolstered by Western arms, Russia has kept up its long-distance bombardment and opened up a new offensive in the east. Some key events so far: February 24: Russia invades Ukraine from three fronts in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Tens of thousands flee.

March 1: Russia hits a TV tower in Kyiv and intensifies bombardment of Kharkiv in the northeast and other cities, in what is seen as a shift in tactics as Moscow\'s hopes of a quick charge on the capital fade. A U.S. official says a miles-long Russian armoured column bearing down on Kyiv has not made any advances in the past 24 hours, bogged down by logistical problems. March 2: Russian forces bombard the southern port of Mariupol for 14 hours and stop civilians leaving, its mayor says - the start of Moscow\'s blockade of the city. Russia denies targeting civilians. Russian troops reach the centre of the Black Sea port of Kherson and claim their first capture of a large urban centre.

Two million have now fled Ukraine, the UNHCR says. March 9: Ukraine accuses Russia of bombing a maternity hospital in Mariupol, burying people in rubble. Russia later says the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters. March 13: Russia extends its war deep into western Ukraine, firing missiles at a base in Yavoriv close to the border with NATO member Poland. The attack kills 35 people and wounds 134, a local official says. March 14: Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova bursts into a state TV studio during a live news bulletin, with a banner reading: \'NO WAR. Stop the war. Don\'t believe propaganda. They are lying to you here.\' March 16: Ukraine accuses Russia of bombing a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of civilians are sheltering. Moscow denies it. March 25: Moscow signals it is scaling back its ambitions and will focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the east, as Ukrainian forces go on the offensive to recapture towns outside Kyiv. March 29: Ukraine proposes adopting a neutral status during talks in Istanbul. March 30: More than 4 million people have fled Ukraine, the UNHCR says. April 1: Ukraine recaptures more territory around Kyiv from Russian soldiers who leave shattered villages and abandoned tanks as they move away from the capital. April 3/4: Ukraine accuses Russia of war crimes after a mass grave and bodies of people shot at close range are found in the recaptured town of Bucha. The Kremlin denies responsibility and says images of bodies were staged. April 8: Ukraine and its allies blame Russia for a missile attack on a train station in Kramatorsk that killed at least 52 people trying to flee the looming eastern offensive. Russia denies responsibility. April 14: Russia\'s lead warship in the Black Sea, the Moskva, sinks after an explosion and fire that Ukraine says was caused by a missile strike. Russia says the ship sank after an ammunition explosion. Washington believes the warship was hit by two Ukrainian missiles.

In total, 317 officers of junior lieutenant rank and above have been killed in a little over two months of fighting, analysis by outlet MediaZona revealed today. Almost a third came from the most senior grades - major or above - including at least two generals and the deputy commander of Russia\'s Black Sea fleet. MediaZona, which is currently blocked in Russia but continues to operate online, compiled its data by looking at public reports of troop deaths from local government officials, newspapers, or families posting on social media. That means the figures will be far lower than the true total because of delays between the troops being killed and their deaths being reported, difficulties in identifying bodies, and deliberate cover-ups by Moscow. In total, MediaZona found 1,744 reports of military deaths in Ukraine - higher than the Kremlin\'s official figure of 1,351 which it has not updated since late March. It found 317 of those deaths were of officers, which accounts for almost a fifth of the total figure. MediaZona believes that is because officer deaths are more-likely to be reported than those of foot-soldiers. The highest-ranked deaths that Russia has acknowledged are of Andrei Sukhovetsky and Vladimir Frolov, who were both Major Generals. Russia has also acknowledged the death of Captain 1st Rank Andrei Paly, the deputy commander of its Black Sea fleet, MediaZona said.

Washington understood how Moscow was behaving. Now there are few rules left.\n\nHe added: \'In those years, there was a channel of communication that both leaders trusted. Now there is no such channel. Nobody is trying to create it.\'\n\nAmerica did set up a \'deconfliction line\' to Moscow in the early days of the Ukraine war, but said the Russia side stopped answering.\n\nLavrov also repeated warnings that shipments of western weapons into Ukraine will be considered legitimate targets by Russia - a day after missiles struck the country\'s train network in an apparent attempt to stop the deliveries.\n\nhe spoke as western nations shift focus in Ukraine from supplying small arms and defensive weapons such as anti-tank and anti-aricraft missiles, to providing heavier arms such as tanks, helicopters, aircraft and long-range artillery.\n\nThe move comes in response to calls from Kyiv to provide its armed forces with the means to recapture territory occupied by Russian forces, in the wake of atrocities carried out by Putin\'s men in places such as Bucha and Irpin.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin travelled to Kyiv on Sunday for a face-to-face meeting with President Zelensky to discuss supplies, before pledging another multi-million dollar shipment.\n\nAustin will also chair a meeting of more than 40 defence ministers at Ramstein air base in Germany today, aimed at securing additional supplies and coordinating efforts between allies to ensure Ukraine has everything it needs.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Austin stated the goal is to ensure Ukraine \'can win\' the war against Russia and \'weaken\' the country to the point where it cannot repeat its invasion a second time.\n\nAhead of the meeting, German media reported that the country will end weeks of dithering and agree to supply heavy arms to Ukraine in the form of 50 Gepard anti-aircraft systems.\n\nUkraine\'s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday night that he regards Russia\'s scaremongering as a sign of weakness.\n\nLavrov, speaking to Russian state TV, said tensions between east and west are now at a worse point than during the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War\n\nRussia considers western arms shipments to Ukraine legitimate targets for attack, Lavrov added, after the US pledged to send heavier weapons to the country this week (file image)\n\nMaria, 13, holds a photograph of her father Yurii Alekseev, 50, a territorial defence member who according to his family was killed by Russian soldiers, as she mourns him during his funeral today\n\nTetyana Boikiv, 52, right, meets and hugs her neighbour Svitlana Pryimachenko, 48, during a funeral service for her husband, Mykola Moroz\n\nGermany will finally authorise tank deliveries to Ukraine Germany will finally authorise the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine today after weeks of dithering that has tarnished its reputation on the world stage and led to questions about its commitment to European security. Defense minister Christine Lambrecht is expected announce the delivery of around 50 Gepard anti-aircraft vehicles to Ukraine during a meeting of more than 40 nations that will take place at Ramstein air base today. Germany\'s defence industry has been offering to sell the Gepard vehicles to Ukraine since February, but had been blocked from doing so by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government which led to outcry both inside and outside the country. Scholz, whose SPD party traditionally maintains close ties with Russia, had argued that it would take too long to train Ukrainian soldiers to use the weapons, that Germany had no weapons to sell, and that selling weapons could provoke Putin. But under strong pressure from Germany\'s international allies as well as his own coalition partners, Scholz now appears to have decided to change course. Lambrecht will today deliver a speech at Ramstein air base in which she will say the government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks. At the same time, a plan will be submitted to parliament calling for the government to \'continue and, where possible, accelerate the delivery of equipment to Ukraine.\' Equipment will be extended to include \'the delivery [of] heavy weapons and complex systems\', according to a draft of the document shown to AFP. The same document will suggest that Ukrainian soldiers are brought to Germany and other NATO nations so they can be trained how to use the weapons.

I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation,\' Heappey told BBC Television.\n\n\'What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia.\'\n\nHeappey told Sky News that while NATO had been reinforcing its eastern flank, it was not, as an organisation, providing military aid.\n\n\'The donor community is not NATO,\' Heappey said. \'The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid.\'\n\nDuring a visit to Kyiv on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised more military aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Monday used an emergency declaration to approve the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine.\n\nThe Pentagon said the package could include artillery ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.\n\nMoscow\'s ambassador to Washington told the United States to halt shipments, warning Western weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nLavrov said: \'NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy.

The explosions destroyed two powerful Soviet-era radio antennas that were re-broadcasting Russian stations in the region of Transnistria, an unrecognised Moscow-backed sliver of land bordering southwestern Ukraine, on Tuesday. The blasts occurred in the small town of Maiac roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine, just days after a Kremlin military chief warned that \'Russian-speakers\' had been \'oppressed\' there. A day earlier, several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the Ministry of State Security in the city of Tiraspol, the region\'s capital. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said. On Tuesday, a military unit in the village of Parcani was also targeted. Officials did not offer any details on the incident, but declared a \'red level of terrorist threat\' and promised to impose additional security measures in the region.

Two million have now fled Ukraine, the UNHCR says. March 9: Ukraine accuses Russia of bombing a maternity hospital in Mariupol, burying people in rubble. Russia later says the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters. March 13: Russia extends its war deep into western Ukraine, firing missiles at a base in Yavoriv close to the border with NATO member Poland. The attack kills 35 people and wounds 134, a local official says.

Austin III told reporters Monday after crossing back into Poland from Ukraine. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can ... to ensure that gets to them.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony J.

That has failed,” Blinken said. Austin added that the U.S. wanted “to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country” and also “to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nThe two senior U.S. officials met for several hours with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who in recent weeks has hosted a number of Western leaders eager to show their support for Kyiv.\n\nIn addition to the new $300-million aid package for Ukraine, the U.S. pledged another $400 million in assistance to other NATO countries and allies who are providing equipment and assistance to the embattled nation.\n\nThe high-level U.S. visit came as fighting continued raging in the eastern and southern parts of the country and Ukrainians marked a somber Orthodox Easter.\n\nThe Biden administration has sent or committed $3.4 billion in armaments for Ukraine during the war, including two $800-million packages in the last 10 days that contained heavier materiel such as artillery, howitzers, tactical drones and combat helicopters.\n\nZelensky said more powerful weaponry was increasingly vital as Russia appears to be expanding its war goal to seize the entire southern coast of Ukraine in addition to the eastern Donbas region.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials did not comment publicly on the trip ahead of it, President Biden issued a statement Sunday praising the fact that Ukraine “still stands” as the war enters its third month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We will continue to support Ukrainians in their fight to defend their homeland,” Biden said.\n\nAs the mournful wail of sirens echoed through the emptied-out cities and towns of Ukraine’s east, Russian troops along a boomerang-shaped, 300-mile-long front line continued a fierce artillery barrage across Donetsk and Luhansk, the two provinces that make up the Donbas region, according to the Ukraine military’s general staff.\n\nIt added that Russia pressed on with its assault of the Azovstal steelworks plant — where the last of Ukrainian defenders in the southern city of Mariupol remain bunkered — and that it also had deployed Iskander-M mobile battlefield missile launchers some 40 miles from the Ukrainian border as part of an ongoing shelling campaign in the northeastern city of Kharkiv.\n\nSenior presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said Russian forces were “continuously attacking” the steel mill in Mariupol with bombs and artillery. Speaking on Twitter early Sunday, he pleaded for an Easter cease-fire, humanitarian escape corridors for civilians and a “special round of negotiations” to exchange military prisoners.

However, Russian troops are failing to make significant territorial gains because of a robust defense, Western officials say.\n\n“Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,” the British Defense Ministry’s intelligence assessment said on Sunday.\n\nThe visit by Blinken and Austin follows a stream of European leaders who have already made what has amounted to a pilgrimage of sorts to Kyiv after the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area. Several countries are also reestablishing their diplomatic missions in the capital — the latest being Britain — after having left ahead of the war. The Biden administration will be under pressure to follow suit. U.S. diplomats initially relocated to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and then pulled out altogether to Poland.\n\nZelensky said he “expected specific things and specific weapons” when world leaders come, adding that he had seen an increase in both the amount and the speed of arms deliveries, especially from Washington.\n\n“They should not come here with empty hands,” he said before the arrival of the U.S. officials, adding that Ukraine should not be used as a prop for “tragic selfies.” “We will return all our land the moment we receive necessary arms.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Kramatorsk, one of the prime targets in Russia’s new phase of the assault, only a few dozen residents attended Easter midnight Mass at the Syvato-Troyitskyy church, a reflection of the tense, fearful atmosphere engulfing the city as the battles edge ever closer.

It’s hard to understand what’s happening, that it could be like this,” he said.\n\nStill, he chose to stay. The situation was still relatively quiet in Kramatorsk, he explained, and as long as the possibility was there to stay, he would.\n\n“The people still here, they’re the children of the church,” he said. “And the father cannot leave them and run away elsewhere.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive-year-old Dasha eats soup at the World Central Kitchen in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on Sunday, April 24, 2022.

Normally the food would be blessed by the priest and then taken home to share within the family on Easter, but this year all the baskets are going to the soldiers on the front lines, the residents said.\n\nAnother 50 miles or so to the south, the checkpoint on the eastern edge of Zaporizhzhia was quiet until early afternoon, when a police car, lights flashing, led a convoy of a dozen cars or more, all people escaping Russian occupation in the southern city of Melitopol, which fell to the Russians several weeks ago.\n\nJuliet Korotvkova, 37, her husband and their four children left Russian- occupied territory over the weekend. “We tried to go earlier,” said Juliet, “but they wouldn’t let us leave. But because of Easter, there’s no fighting, and it’s quiet. We told them we have a sick child who needs an operation and they let us go.” Juliet held her 11-month-old son, Michael, who had a large bandage across his stomach that requires surgery.

I didn’t understand anything they were saying. There were 20 checkpoints. Thank God they didn’t do anything to us.”\n\nZaporizhzhia has become a way station for refugees fleeing Melitopol and Mariupol, with volunteers offering shelter, food and medical care.\n\nSeveral of those arriving said they were taking advantage of the Easter holiday to escape, hoping the fighting would have calmed.\n\nZelensky issued an Easter message to his people.

Measures included the instalment of military checkpoints at the entrances to the cities of the region and the cancellation of the annual 9 May victory day parade.\n\nBob Deen, an expert on Moldova and a senior research fellow at the Clingendael Institute thinktank, said it was difficult to know whether the recent incidents were a false-flag operation by Russia or genuine acts of sabotage by anti-Russian groups.\n\nBut he said recent Russian rhetoric pointed to some of the long-term goals Russia had in mind for Transnistria. “We have seen that the topic of Transnistria is becoming discussed more openly in the Russian public domain. Russian recent statements could be an indication of the ambitions Moscow has there.”\n\nAccording to Deen, it was unlikely that Russian forces would be able to stage an offensive toward the border with Moldova, given that Moscow was engaged in heavy fighting in the eastern Donbas region. To get to Transnistria, Moscow would need to stage an offensive toward Odesa, which has been hindered by the recent sinking of the Moskva cruiser, which forced Russian warships to move further away from Ukraine’s coast.\n\nDeen was also sceptical that Transnistria’s own forces, which number about 7,500 troops, would be used in an attack on Ukraine from its western border.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\n\n“There is little appetite to fight in Ukraine among the Transnistrian troops as well as the general population in the region, many of whom are leaving towards Moldova to escape any potential violence.”\n\n“Similarly to Belarus, the region does not want to be fully dragged into this war,” he said, adding that the recent rhetoric by Moscow may be a ploy to get Ukraine to pull troops away from the Donbas towards its western border.\n\nWith Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the early 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a permanent Russian garrison. Russian state media – widely available in Transnistria – have played a significant role in cementing pro-Russian attitudes in the enclave as Moldova has shifted towards the west under the leadership of its liberal president.\n\nLast week, Sandu signed into law a bill banning the orange and black striped ribbons of Saint George, which enjoy wide popularity in Russia as a way to show public support for the government and the military, a move that angered Russian officials. In the same bill, Sandu banned the prowar signs “Z” and “V”, first used by the Russian armed forces.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f556b4f5969aec1d82c542b66f8d60ada25ad610/2295_761_2774_1664/master/2774.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b0b7007651a86b3db7c4c9a092cf731', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:05:03'}

Washington welcomed Berlin\'s move.\n\nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, believe Russia will rely heavily on artillery strikes to pound Ukrainian positions while moving in ground forces from several directions to try to envelop and wipe out much of Ukraine\'s military.\n\nBut Washington also estimates that many Russian units are depleted, with some operating with personnel losses as high as 30% - a level considered by the U.S. military to be too high to keep fighting indefinitely.\n\nWAR BY \'PROXY\'\n\nIn a marked escalation of Russian rhetoric, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was asked on state TV late on Monday about the prospect of World War Three and whether the current situation could be compared to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis that nearly caused nuclear war.\n\n"The danger is serious, real," Lavrov said, according to the ministry\'s transcript of the interview. "NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby criticized Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"It\'s obviously unhelpful," Kirby said. "A nuclear war cannot be won and it shouldn\'t be fought. There\'s no reason for the current conflict in Ukraine to get to that level at all."\n\nMark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters while flying to Tuesday\'s meeting in Germany that the next few weeks in Ukraine would be "very, very critical."\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield," he said.\n\nIn a possible sign of the conflict spreading, Ukraine accused Russia of trying to drag neighboring Moldova\'s breakaway region of Transdniestria into its war on Kyiv after authorities in the Moscow-backed territory said they had been targeted by a series of attacks.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, visiting Moscow on Tuesday, said he was ready to fully mobilize the organization\'s resources to save lives and evacuate people from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nGuterres, who is due to visit Kyiv on Thursday, proposed a "Humanitarian Contact Group" of Russia, Ukraine and U.N. officials to seek opportunities "for the opening of safe corridors, with local cessations of hostilities, and to guarantee that they are actually effective."\n\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no corridors were operating on Tuesday due to continued fighting.\n\nThe United Nations said Putin had agreed "in principle" during talks with Guterres to U.N. and Red Cross involvement in evacuating civilians from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, scene of the worst fighting of the war.\n\nIn an interview with the government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Putin ally Patrushev accused the United States of "trying to divide essentially a single people," echoing Putin\'s contention that Ukraine is really a part of Russia.\n\n"The result of the policy of the West and the regime in Kyiv can only be the disintegration of Ukraine into several states," said Patrushev, who is secretary of Russia\'s Security Council.\n\nMOLDOVA\n\nAuthorities in Transdniestria, an unrecognized sliver of land bordering southwestern Ukraine that has been occupied by Russian troops since the 1990s, said explosions had damaged two radio masts that broadcast in Russian and that one of its military units had been attacked.\n\nIt provided few details, but blamed Ukraine, raising its "terrorist" threat level to red.\n\nMoldova\'s pro-Western President Maia Sandu blamed the "escalation attempts" on "pro-war" factions in Transdniestria.\n\nMoldova, an ex-Soviet republic with close cultural ties to NATO member Romania, expressed alarm last week after a top Russian general said Moscow aims to forge a path through Ukraine to Transdniestria.\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine, launched on Feb. 24, has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than 5 million people to flee abroad.\n\nMoscow calls its actions a "special operation" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West call this a false pretext for an unprovoked war to seize territory.', 'image': 'https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=93d13d1c-9dd9-4bab-8f3c-4eb14c7cd7be&SiteName=Newsmax', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:05:08'}

The press event followed a trip to Kiev by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Austin.\n\nAustin was asked how he defines "America\'s goals for success" in Ukraine. He first said that the US wants to see "Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory." But then he added: "We want to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kind things that it has done in invading Ukraine." I had feared that geopolitical strategizing is affecting the US approach, but this is the first public indication of that I have seen.\n\nIt cannot be said too strongly: The US government must not be guided by any notion that a quagmire in Ukraine would drain Russian resources, diminish Russian influence and power globally, and possibly lead to regime change. The United States instead should do all within its power to help bring the war to a close rapidly in order to limit suffering; to eliminate risks that the conflict will widen and escalate, possibly to nuclear war; and to limit the negative global economic and food security repercussions.\n\nA broader reason for determined efforts to end the war is the need to work toward restoring a relationship with Russia enabling cooperation on nuclear arms control and disarmament, climate protection, public health, and other vital matters of global concern.\n\nUS energy in helping bring the war to a close is also appropriate in view of the political responsibility of the United States, together with NATO, since the late 1990s in helping to create the conditions for a crisis. Actions having this effect included precipitously withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2003, subsequently establishing missile defense facilities in Romania and Poland, and opening the door to Ukraine\'s membership in NATO in 2008.\n\nIn a recent paper, End the War, Stop the War Crimes, Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy outlines already widely discussed elements of an approach to ending the war. In brief, Russia and Ukraine should quickly agree to a cease-fire to enable negotiation of a settlement.\n\nNegotiations should then aim to end the war immediately and to resolve the overarching disputes concerning governance of the Donbas region and the status of Crimea. A long-term consultative mechanism could be put in place to resolve time-intensive or recurring issues and to help maintain peace and human security. Ukraine appears ready to forswear any possibility of joining NATO, so long as some form of guaranteed neutrality can be established, but seeks to join the European Union. The overall aim should be the preservation of Ukraine\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with the UN Charter.\n\nWe are ruled by idiots. https://t.co/Z2PLZArxYw — Moon of Alabama (@MoonofA) April 26, 2022\n\nIn addition to any role they can play, behind the scenes or not, in bringing about a cease-fire and negotiating a settlement, the United States and other states must be ready to lift war-related sanctions and to accept and support some form of neutrality for Ukraine should Ukraine choose that.\n\nRussia\'s war on Ukraine is already causing appalling suffering and devastation. It is playing with fire—even nuclear fire—to allow the war to go on indefinitely and potentially to widen and escalate, at least partly with the aim of weakening Russia. The right course is to making ending the war on acceptable, if not perfect, terms the highest priority.', 'image': 'https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2022-04/austinkiev.jpg?itok=zdw01GVC', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:35'}

But the report stops short of recommending direct financial reparations, and officials have no immediate plans for that kind of support.\n\nHarvard, the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college, is the latest among a growing number of U.S. schools attempting to confront their involvement with slavery and also make amends for it.\n\nThe report, commissioned by Bacow, found that Harvard’s faculty, staff and leaders enslaved more than 70 Black and Native American people from the school’s founding in 1636 to 1783. It cautions that the figure is “almost certainly an undercount.” Using historical records, researchers were able to identify dozens of enslaved people by name, along with their connection to the university.\n\nMost were identified only by a single name, such as Cesar, Dinah and Venus.\n\n“Enslaved men and women served Harvard presidents and professors and fed and cared for Harvard students,” researchers found. “Moreover, throughout this period and well into the 19th century, the University and its donors benefited from extensive financial ties to slavery.”\n\nThe report says the university “should make a significant monetary commitment, and it should invest in remedies of equal or greater breadth than other universities.” Bacow said Harvard will attempt to redress its wrongs through “teaching, research and service." He is creating a committee to implement the report\'s suggestions.\n\nBuilding on earlier research at Harvard, the report details how the university depended on the slave trade in its early years and profited from it for decades.\n\nHarvard invested directly in the sugar and rum trades in the Caribbean, along with the U.S. cotton and railroad industries. The college\'s early growth is credited to support from wealthy donors who accumulated their fortunes through the slave trade and industries that relied on it.\n\nAlong with the 70 people who were enslaved, the report also lists their enslavers — including several Harvard presidents and high-ranking officials — and the campus buildings, rooms and professorships that are still named after them.\n\nEven after slavery was abolished, the report says, prominent scholars continued to promote concepts that fueled racist ideas.\n\nIt cites work by 19th century professor Louis Agassiz, who pushed discredited theories on “race science” and eugenics. Another scholar led a “physical education” program that collected students’ physical measurements to support research advancing eugenic theories.\n\nIn his message, Bacow called the findings “disturbing and shocking,” and he acknowledged that the school “perpetuated practices that were profoundly immoral.”\n\n“Consequently, I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society,” he wrote.\n\nThe 130-page report included a series of recommendations that Bacow endorsed. The $100 million will be used to carry out the work, with some funding to be made available now and more to be held in an endowment. The university itself has an endowment of more than $50 billion, the largest in the nation.\n\nThe report says Harvard should identify the descendants of enslaved people and engage with them “through dialogue, programming, information sharing, relationship building and educational support.”\n\n“Through such efforts, these descendants can recover their histories, tell their stories and pursue empowering knowledge,” the report said.\n\nMore broadly, it urges Harvard to fight racial inequality by expanding education options for descendants of enslaved people, especially in the South and the Caribbean. It calls on the university to work closely with historically Black colleges across the country, with new funding to bring students and scholars to Harvard for up to a year at a time.\n\nAnd acknowledging the enslavement of Native Americans, it calls on Harvard to build closer ties with New England tribes. Harvard should recruit more students from tribal communities, the report says, and organize a national conference promoting research on the enslavement of Indigenous people.\n\nIn accepting the recommendations, Harvard joins an increasing number of colleges attempting to move from research to action as they reconcile with their histories.\n\nGeorgetown University in 2019 promised to raise $400,000 a year for the descendants of enslaved people sold by the school. The Princeton Theological Seminary created a $27.6 million reparative endowment. The University of Virginia established scholarships for the descendants of enslaved people.\n\nHarvard formally began exploring its ties to slavery in 2016, when former President Drew Gilpin Faust acknowledged that the school was “directly complicit in America’s system of racial bondage." Faust organized a committee to study the topic and had a plaque installed on campus honoring enslaved people who labored there.\n\nStudent activists had been shining a light on Harvard\'s darker histories for years. In 2015, students demanded that Harvard Law School abandon its official crest, which was tied to an 18th century donor whose family enslaved dozens of people. Months later, the school retired the symbol.\n\nSoon after becoming president, Bacow established a new Presidential Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery to dig deeper into the university\'s role. That effort led to the new report.\n\n“The Harvard that I have known, while far from perfect, has always tried to be better — to bring our lived experience ever closer to our high ideals,” Bacow wrote. “In releasing this report and committing ourselves to following through on its recommendations, we continue a long tradition of embracing the challenges before us.”', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:05:07'}

The university also appointed a committee chaired by Martha Minow, former dean of Harvard Law School, to move recommendations into action and committed $100 million to fund its initiative.\n\n“The legacy of slavery, including the persistence of both overt and subtle discrimination against people of color, continues to influence the world in the form of disparities in education, health, wealth, income, social mobility, and almost any other metric we might use to measure equality,” Bacow said in a statement. “Consequently, I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society.”\n\nHarvard’s report revealed dozens of individuals — including five of the university’s previous presidents — enslaved African and Indigenous people, according to city vital records, wills and other documents.\n\nIn recent years, several other colleges have started reckoning with their ties to slavery and indentured servitude. The University of Mississippi and Georgetown University revealed that they benefited from slave labor, while Brown University students voted in March 2021 for the institution to offer reparations to descendants of enslaved laborers. Columbia University also publicly marked its ties to slavery by adding historical markers to four of its residence halls, including Furnald Hall — which was home to Frederick Wells, the first Black student to live on campus and who was harassed by Ku Klux Klan members.\n\nWhile reviewing Harvard’s history of slavery may be troubling, Bacow said, he strongly encouraged all students, faculty and other members of the university community to read the report.\n\n“Many of you will find it disturbing and even shocking,” Bacow said. “Many of you may also be disappointed in learning painful truths about the history of an institution that you have come to know, respect, and even love.

Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., was cited Tuesday for having a loaded 9mm handgun at a TSA checkpoint at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, the second time he has been stopped with a firearm at an airport since taking office last year.\n\nThe incident occurred just before 9 a.m., when Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said it was notified that Transportation Security Administration agents had found a firearm, ammunition and a magazine in Cawthorn\'s belongings at a security checkpoint, according to a police report.\n\nCawthorn was issued a citation in lieu of an arrest for possession of a dangerous weapon on city property, a misdemeanor charge. The airport is owned and operated by the City of Charlotte and has several postings stating “no dangerous weapons allowed,” police said in their report. They added in a statement that Cawthorn was cooperative and told officers that the gun belonged to him.\n\nA TSA spokesperson said the penalty for violating rules surrounding firearms is up to $13,900. It was not immediately clear if the agency will pursue a fine against Cawthorn. The spokesperson told NBC News that while it doesn\'t discuss the details of each case, "in almost every incident we issue one," with a review and potential penalty likely in the coming weeks.\n\nAuthorities last year stopped Cawthorn from carrying a loaded 9mm handgun onto a flight out of Asheville, North Carolina. The TSA says civil penalties are often higher for "repeat violations."\n\nAfter Cawthorn was released Tuesday, officers took possession of the firearm, a standard procedure, police said.\n\nA citation instead of arrest in also normal procedure, the department said, "unless there are other associated felony charges or extenuating circumstances."\n\nNBC News has reached out to Cawthorn\'s office for comment.\n\nThe misdemeanor charge is Cawthorn\'s second in the past two months. In March, he was charged with driving with a revoked license and faces two pending citations for speeding. He has a May 6 court date for the license charge, a misdemeanor.\n\nCawthorn, 26, uses a wheelchair because he was seriously injured in a 2014 car accident while riding as a passenger in the car of a friend who fell asleep at the wheel, according to his 2019 federal court filing against the auto insurance company.\n\nThe North Carolina Republican recently caused an uproar when he claimed on a podcast that his congressional colleagues were using drugs and inviting him to sex parties. On the podcast, Cawthorn discussed “the sexual perversion that goes on in Washington” and said some of his older colleagues had invited him to a “sexual get-together.”\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., on Tuesday questioned Cawthorn\'s maturity after his recent run-ins with the law.\n\n"Speeding tickets have happened and driving without a license has happened," Tillis said when asked about Cawthorn\'s past encounters with law enforcement. "These things just speak to judgement. Judgement or maturity."\n\nLast month, Tillis endorsed Cawthorn’s primary challenger, state Sen. Chuck Edwards.\n\n"We’ve got to have somebody who’s demonstrating judgment and temperament and a willingness to work together for the betterment of North Carolinians," Tillis said Tuesday, adding that right now Cawthorn is "not at that table."', 'image': 'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-04/220426-madison-cawthorn-mjf-1402-a54ddf.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:56'}

We\'re in a safe locations - can\'t disclose where.\'\n\nCawthorn has had a habit of generating headlines ever since winning election to the House in 2020 - either through his taste for bombast or run-ins with law enforcement.\n\nDashcam footage emerged last week of a March traffic stop when a police officer informed the 26-year-old congressman that he was driving with a revoked license in his home state.\n\nHe was asked to turn over his license and switch seats with a woman who had been in the passenger seat of his pickup truck, a two-minute thirty-two-second video shared by the Charlotte Observer shows.\n\nAnd Queen City News recently released footage from a traffic stop in October during which Cawthorn was pulled over for speeding.\n\n\'I do not have my wallet on me,\' the lawmaker says when asked if he had his license.\n\nAnd Cawthorn again appeared surprised at being informed he was breaking the rules, with the officer in that incident telling him the car was registered to his father -- despite Cawthorn claiming it was in his name.\n\nHe later reportedly pleaded guilty to improper equipment and paid a $25 fine.\n\nCawthorn has also sought out the spotlight for himself, making wild claims about cocaine-fuelled orgies in Washington, which earned him the anger of colleagues.\n\nDuring an interview with John Lovell for the \'Warrior Poet Society\' he was asked how closely Washington resembles the fictional version in the Netflix show House of Cards, specifically its elements of \'corruption, power, money and perversion.\'\n\nThe North Carolina Republican replied that the \'sexual perversion\' and drug use is just like what people saw on television.\n\nThe photos, obtained by Politico and look to make even the most devoted partiers blush, show the 26-year-old Republican with a vacant look in his eyes, wearing women\'s hoop earrings and a woman\'s necklace along with a bra and lingerie seT\n\nCawthorn brushed off the photos on Twitter Friday evening, and claimed it was all part of a cruise ship game and was another attack from the left.\n\n\'The sexual perversion that goes on in Washington ... being kind of a young guy in Washington where the average age is probably 60 or 70, I look at all these people - a lot of them who I\'ve looked up to throughout my life ... then all of a sudden you get invited to like, "well hey we\'re going to have kind of a sexual get together at one of our homes.

NYU Students for Justice in Palestine sent out an email in essence justifying Palestinians terrorists murdering Israeli civilians. In the course of doing so, the author of the email threw some antisemitic tropes regarding Jewish control of the media, including arguing that "framing is everything and the Zionist grip on the media is omnipresent" and referencing the "Islamophobic, Zionist-funded US and Western media." Several other NYU student groups chimed in to endorse the email.\n\nDefenders of the email, as one would expect, argue that vehemently criticizing Israel and Zionism, even arguing that Palestinians have the right to murder Israel civilians to resist "occupation," is not antisemitic. However, as I noted in my original post on the matter, the lines noted in the above paragraph criticize neither Israel as a state nor Zionism as an ideology. Rather, they claim that "Zionists" fund and control the media. And as I noted, the most obvious form of antisemitism that tries to obscure itself behind antizionism is when one can substitute the word "Zionist" for the word "Jew," and one is left with an obvious, longstanding antisemitic trope, as with the NYU SJP email.\n\nI can easily imagine a student or student organization signing on to the statement, not recognizing or noticing the obvious (at least to those with some knowledge of the history and practice of antisemitism) antisemitic implications of claiming that Zionists fund and control an Islamaphobic media. And I can easily imagine them regretting this language, even if they decline to publicly apologize for it or retract it. Indeed, I would think that even antisemitic students would regret the language in question, because it associates a cause they support with antisemitism, which simply isn\'t a good strategy, at least in the US.\n\nMore generally, when someone uses antisemitic language, I\'m inclined to point it out, but not suggest that the individual himself or herself is antisemitic. Some people pick up antisemitic tropes unknowingly or negligently. Some use overly provocative language without really thinking of the implications.\n\nI\'d prefer that such individuals retract and/or apologize for their language. But even if they don\'t, I\'m still hesitant to judge them more harshly than what I suggested in the previous paragraph. I\'m also inclined to give the benefit of the doubt in general to people who are speaking (or tweeting) off the cuff.\n\nBut I draw the line at people who, once their antisemitic language has been pointed out to them, choose to double down on it. That includes NYU law student Yosmin Badie, previously best known for repeatedly tweeting "fuck Israel," along with the occasional "fuck Amerikkka." As reported by JTA:\n\nYosmin Badie, a member of NYU Law\'s Students for Justice in Palestine, said in a statement to the New York Jewish Week that the response to the [Student of Justice in Palestine\'s] emails was "shameful." "The effort to silence those who choose to speak out against apartheid and violent occupation is shameful, and equally shameful is the purposeful conflation of antisemitism and anti-Zionism," Badie said. "I will not be intimidated by those who wish to deny this right and will continue to unequivocally stand with Palestinians in their struggle," she said.\n\nAccording to Ms. Badie, you see, not only was the email not antisemitic but only "antizionist" (please tell us, Ms. Badie, who these "Zionists" are who control and fund the media?), but pointing out and criticizing the underlying antisemitism is an attempt to silence her.\n\nI\'m not here to silence or "cancel" Ms. Badie. But I also don\'t see that Jews need to sit back and let antisemites like Ms. Badie hide behind "antizionism" while purporting to represent anti-racism and progressive values and not call them out for it. (And by the way, in case you are inclined to think that Ms. Badie must have been traumatized by her experiences as a Palestinian victim of Israel or whatever formulation people use to excuse Palestinian extremism, she identifies herself on Twitter as an "Iranian American" and has been affiliated with the National Iranian American Council, known for running interference in the US on behalf of the Iranian theocracy. Always interesting to find self-proclaimed "human rights activists" with origins in horrible dictatorships who focus their energy on Israel instead.)\n\nSo, Ms. Badie, you have a right to spew whatever antisemitic (and genocidal) rhetoric you wish. And I may point out that you are an antisemite. And, for what it\'s worth, the same applies to any of your classmates who continue to defend the email SJP sent out.\n\nAnd while we are on the subject, readers should check out NYU law student Tal Fortgang\'s essay at Bari Weiss\' substack, To the Antisemites Who Sit Next to Me in School.\n\nUPDATE: If you thought that perhaps by now SJP at NYU Law would have second thoughts about using antisemitic tropes in its communications, and might acknowledge that it was a mistake to use such tropes, you would be wrong.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:01'}

Truman (Roosevelt had recently died) and Mao to President Franklin D. Roosevelt (herein FDR). Both wanted to begin a relationship with the United States. FDR died April 12, 1945. What might have been!\n\nRegarding Vietnam, in March 1945, shortly before his death, FDR told Gen. Albert Coady Wedemeyer that he, “’… was going to do everything possible to give the people of that area (Indochina, including Vietnam) their independence.’” (Russell H. Fifield (my former professor), "Americans in Southeast Asia," 1973, 42). Fifield writes that “at lunch (FDR) brought up the subject of French Indochina … He was opposed to colonialism anywhere in the world and specifically wanted to prevent the restoration of Indochina to the French.” (Ibid.).\n\nFDR had been preoccupied with Indochina: “…President Roosevelt’s preoccupation with Indochina and the attitude of the French there did not abate to his dying day … Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambodia … they probably absorbed more of the President’s attention than they deserved.” (Bernard B. Fall, "The Two Viet-Nams," 1967, 46). FDR thought Indochina might be suitable for the trusteeship system of the new United Nations. Fifield writes: “If his trusteeship concept had been implemented, possibly two bloody and costly wars might have been avoided.” (Fifield, 43).\n\nShortly after FDR’s death, Ho made several appeals to the president of the United States. He even sought to have the “Indochina Issue” brought up before the United Nations. He wrote to Truman on Feb. 16, 1946, asking that Vietnam get independence like the Philippines (we gave the Philippines independence in 1946), with “’full independence and full cooperation’” with the United States. (Fifield, 110). “The failure of Washington to capitalize on the goodwill of Hanoi … cannot easily be laid to rest … In light of subsequent developments there is a tendency to consider the American failure a lost opportunity.” (Ibid., 111).\n\nRegarding China, on Jan. 9, 1945, Mao Zedong and Chou En-lai proposed a visit to the United States to meet with “the highest United States officials …’Mao and Chou will be immediately available either singly or together for exploratory conference at Washington should President Roosevelt express desire to receive them at White House as leaders of primary Chinese party.’” (Barbara W. Tuchman, “If Mao had come to Washington.” Foreign Affairs, October 1972, 2).\n\nThe willingness to go so far shows the seriousness of their overture; it would have been Mao’s first visit outside of China. “Primarily they wanted to convince President Roosevelt that they, and not the Kuomintang, represented the future of China … They felt the United States was blind to the real state of the Kuomintang’s decline and their own rise, and that if they could reach Roosevelt they could make this clear.” (Ibid., 8).\n\nThe major problem in making the connection was Ambassador Patrick J. Hurley, a Chiang Kai-shek man. By chance, this man, a relatively minor figure, made the difference. “A different man might have facilitated rather than blocked the visit of Mao and Chou…” (Ibid., 20). Tuchman concludes: “Though we defeated Japan, the goal that would have made sense of the victory, a strong united China on our side after the war, escaped us. (Ibid., 21).\n\nThe Korean War and the Vietnam wars (both French and American) might not have occurred had Ho and Mao made it to Washington. Most urgently now, the Taiwan crisis would probably not be threatening world order and a possible nuclear war. We would be more likely to have had a peaceful rise to power of China, which would include Taiwan, and a balance with the United States and its partners in the Pacific.\n\nAs John Greenleaf Whittier wrote: “For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, ‘It might have been.’” Had only Roosevelt lived and Ho, Mao and Chou reached Washington!\n\nJames W.

Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe check is due now, Mr. Ex-President. A New York judge said that Donald Trump would have to start paying a fine of $10,000 per day on Tuesday after finding him in contempt of court for failing to comply with a state Attorney General\'s Office subpoena for business-related documents. "Mr. Trump has willfully disobeyed a lawful order of the Court," Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a three-page order Tuesday. The written order came a day after Engoron held a hearing on the issue and orally ruled that Trump was in contempt of court. Attorney General Letitia James is investigating the Trump Organization and Trump in connection with allegations that the company improperly manipulated the stated valuations of various real estate assets to gain more favorable financial terms for loans and insurance, and to lower their tax liabilities. The Trump Organization denies any wrongdoing, and the Republican Trump himself has accused James, a Democrat, of a politically motivated witch hunt. Engoron on Tuesday wrote that "each day that passes without compliance" by Trump with James\' subpoena "further prejudices" the attorney general\'s civil investigation, "as the statute of limitations continue to run and may result in [James] being unable to pursue certain causes of action that [she] otherwise would."\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, U.S. February 26, 2022. Octavio Jones | Reuters\n\nThe judge said Trump would have to pay $10,000 per day until he satisfies the judge that he has complied with the subpoena. The order left open the possibility that Trump could satisfy the subpoena by detailing in a sworn statement that he had conducted a thorough search for the records, which his lawyer has claimed he was unable to find. Trump\'s attorney Alina Habba said Monday that she will file an appeal of Engoron\'s contempt-of-court finding against the former president and the related daily fine. In February, Engoron had ordered Trump to produce certain documents sought by James through a subpoena. James earlier this month asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt for failing to surrender those documents, and for instead waiting until the deadline for the order on March 31 to raise objections to the subpoena, and for claiming to the AG only then that Trump was unable to locate any of the documents. Engoron, in his order Tuesday, wrote that Trump had waived his right "to raise boilerplate objections to the subpoena by not timely" making them known when he previously tried to get the judge to quash the subpoena. "Having stipulated to produce all the documents by March 31, 2022, Mr. Trump may no longer challenge the validity of the subpoena," Engoron wrote.', 'image': 'https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107021528-16459269122022-02-27t014604z_1006928119_rc2zrs9z5jsx_rtrmadp_0_usa-election-cpac.jpeg?v=1645926955&w=1920&h=1080', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:32'}

James is a Democrat.\n\nTrump, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., also were subpoenaed and ordered by Engoron, the same judge, to provide testimony to the attorney general. An appeal is pending for that testimony.\n\nThe ex-president\'s third-eldest child Eric Trump was questioned by James in fall of 2020.\n\nIn court on Monday, prosecutors from James\' office sought to paint Trump as uncooperative and a hinderance to their years-long probe.\n\n\'Mr. Trump, I know you take your business seriously, and I take mine seriously,\' Judge Arthur Engoron said\n\nNew York attorney Kevin Wallace compared working with the Trump Organization to \'pulling teeth\' to get necessary documents, CNN reports.\n\n\'We are being hampered in our efforts to have a complete understanding because we don\'t have evidence from the person who sits at the top of the organization,\' another of James\' lawyers, Andrew Amer, said.\n\nHabba said she personally flew to Florida to look through Trump\'s papers for the relevant files -- and that most of what the ex-president kept were hard copies.\n\n\'President Trump does not email. He does not text message. And he has no work computer at home or anywhere else,\' she said.\n\n\'I took it upon myself to get on a plane and flew down and asked him one by one if there was anything that he had on his person that he had not given me I would need that. And he did not.\'\n\nHabba suggested Trump would file his own sworn affidavit that he did not have the documents -- which could relieve him of the contempt charge and heavy fines.\n\nIn a late March filing James said Trump himself only turned over 10 documents in more than two years. He was due to hand over the latest round by March 31, already an extension of a previous filing.\n\nThe ex-president\'s lawyer contends that James made no effort \'to resolve the underlying issues\' before accusing Trump of a lack of cooperation and demanding a daily $10,000 fine.\n\n\'While [the Attorney General] was publicly putting out a barrage of press statements about the instant motion, [the Attorney General\'s] counsel was privately rebuffing numerous attempts by [Trump\'s] counsel to engage in good-faith discussions to address the issues at hand,\' Habba wrote in the 27-page filing.\n\nHabba accused James\' team of \'refusing\' her \'request for a simple phone call.\'\n\n\'Given the [Attorney General\'s] recalcitrant behavior, it is fair to question the [Attorney General\'s] motive in bringing the instant application, which appears to be little more than a contrived publicity stunt,\' Trump\'s lawyer said.\n\nJames\' civil probe is running parallel to a criminal investigation being conducted out of the Manhattan District Attorney\'s office, headed by Alvin Bragg since January.\n\nBragg\'s investigation appeared to grind to a halt following the departure of its two top prosecutors, reportedly over the Democrat official\'s doubts that charges against Trump would stick.\n\nHowever he released a statement earlier this month, declining to outline specific steps or details but pledging \'the investigation continues.\'', 'image': 'https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/25/18/57033213-0-image-a-4_1650906453622.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:26'}

(John Fredricks/The Epoch Times)\n\nUCI Cyber Security Expert, Ex-CIA Analyst Weighs in on Putin, Ukraine War\n\nAs a former senior Soviet analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency as well as ex-advisor to President George W. Bush, then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, and other senior government officials, Bryan Cunningham—who is now the Executive Director of the Cybersecurity Policy and Research Institute at the University of California–Irvine—spent years studying Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Epoch Times, Cunningham weighed in on Putin’s war with Ukraine now entering its third month.\n\n“I believe we are in more danger now [than during the Cuban Missile Crisis],” he said. “There really is a measurable possibility of a nuclear war.”\n\nAccording to Cunningham, a year ago the likelihood of nuclear war was 1 percent. Now, he says that number is “likely in the double-digits, which is terrifying.”\n\nThis is partly due to Cunningham’s belief that Putin is “less stable” than Khruschev, the former Cold War Soviet leader who once challenged the United States to a missile “shooting match,” and that there is no one in Russia who can “check” Putin’s power or remove him from office.\n\nAdditionally, Cunningham said he believes Putin’s behavior mimics previous dictators, in addition to reports that he is isolating himself from advisors and foreign dignitaries both physically and politically.\n\n“Typically when you’re a dictator for that long, just like Stalin … or Hitler, you stop allowing people near you who will say anything that disagrees with you,” Cunningham said.\n\nAccording to Cunningham, who is also an attorney with the Los Angeles-based firm Zweiback, Fiset & Coleman, Ukraine is an all-or-nothing issue now for Putin.\n\n“I think he’s willing to do whatever it takes to, in his mind, win. I think he feels like this is his legacy now,” Cunningham said.\n\nHis “pessimism” about Putin, Cunningham said, stems from his orders to use tanks and live ammunition to attack the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine in early March, as well as Russia’s military doctrine of using progressively harsher methods including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons to avoid losing the war, no matter the cost.\n\nA damaged administrative building of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in Enerhodar, the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine, on March 4, 2022.

He added: “Bluster about the use of nuclear, the possible use of nuclear weapons is very dangerous and unhelpful.

But there was no announcement of any commitment to send tanks.\n\nAlthough Nato has repeatedly said it will not enter the war to fight against Russia, western politicians have begun to say their goal is help Ukraine decisively defeat to its neighbour, so that it cannot threaten Kyiv or other neighbours.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am<br><br>\n\nEarlier this week Austin said that Russia should be “weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine” and when asked again about that statement on Tuesday, he offered a similar formulation.\n\n“We would like to make sure again, they don’t have the same type of capability to bully their neighbours that we saw at the outset of this conflict,” he said, highlighting that Russia’s “land forces have been attrited in a very significant way, casualties are pretty substantial, they’ve lost a lot of equipment.”\n\nPrior to the meeting, the US said that the total value of arms donated to Ukraine was $5bn, with the US accounting for $3.7bn. On Monday, the UK said it had already sent £200m worth of arms and had a budget to supply £500m if needed.\n\nThe UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said in a major speech on Tuesday night that the west will never feel safe again and Europe will experience untold further misery if Putin succeeds in Ukraine.\n\n“We cannot be complacent – the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance. And let’s be clear – if Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again. So we must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support for Ukraine,” she said in the foreign secretary’s annual Mansion House speech.\n\nTruss, still seen as a frontrunner for the Conservative leadership if Boris Johnson resigns, called for a “recasting and rebooting” of the global security architecture “since it has failed Ukraine”, arguing the conflict could be a catalyst for change in the way the free world deters global aggressors.\n\n“I want to live in a world where free nations are assertive and in the ascendant … where freedom and democracy are strengthened through a network of economic and security partnerships … where aggressors are contained and moving toward a better path.

Service members were exposed to asbestos, vermin, mold and raw sewage.\n\nRead the Reuters investigation here https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-lackland/\n\nThe Reuters reports prompted an investigation by the Air Force and Justice Department.\n\nThe subcommittee findings were released ahead of a hearing scheduled for Tuesday, “Mistreatment of Military Families in Privatized Housing,” at which senators including Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, plan to hear from military members and question company executives including Balfour Beatty Communities president Rick Taylor.\n\nService members are expected to describe their experiences in Balfour Beatty housing and health problems they believe were triggered by mold and other hazards. The subcommittee is scheduled to call on Balfour executives to testify under oath, according to a hearing witness list.\n\nThe subcommittee said its investigation relied on visits to military bases and 11,000 pages of records, including work order data and internal company communications, a dozen interviews with military families and interviews with 11 current and former Balfour Beatty employees. The company operates 43,000 homes at 55 Army, Navy and Air Force installations across the United States, the report said.\n\nBalfour Beatty Communities is a unit of British infrastructure conglomerate Balfour Beatty Plc (BALF.L). It is one of several major housing companies that serve as landlords on U.S. military bases under a decades-old housing privatization program.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Joshua Schneyer and M.B.

So she\'s watching over us.\' Advertisement\n\n\'And it’s at the hands of some of these same people that Harry experienced some of his darkest and most distressing moments as a working member of the Firm\'.\n\nHarry is known to have an historical hatred for the so-called ‘men in grey suits’, the senior courtiers who advise the Queen, such as her private secretary Sir Edward Young, whom he believes has deliberately kept him at arm’s length.\n\nMr Scobie: \'I remember how my jaw dropped when a friend of the couple gave me a play-by-play account of how the Queen’s private secretary, Edward Young, went out of his way to prevent the couple from visiting the monarch in Sandringham\'.\n\nBut the Queen is also surrounded a tight-knit and intensely devoted circle of mostly long-standing servants.\n\nThey are led by Miss Kelly, a former dresser promoted to the special position of ‘personal assistant, advisor and curator’ to the Queen, who is so close to her boss that she wears in her shoes and revels in her position as her gatekeeper.\n\nHarry famously fell out with the Liverpool docker’s daughter over Meghan’s choice of tiara for their wedding.\n\nHe accused Miss Kelly of being deliberately obstructive towards his fiancée, while supporters of the royal right-hand woman say the Queen’s grandson was rude and short-tempered, effectively telling her: ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.’\n\nWriting about the aides Scobie said: \'Angela Kelly, who multiple sources told me made it almost impossible for Meghan to have a necessary “hair trial” with her chosen wedding tiara—even standing up the duchess-to-be and her hairstylist, who had flown in especially, at a pre-scheduled fitting. Harry, sources said, felt it was a cruel attempt to put his partner “in her place”.\'\n\nMeghan returned with Harry for less than 24 hours for the first time in more than two years, staying at Frogmore Cottage, the home they have kept on the Queen’s Windsor estate.\n\nHarry and Meghan arrived in Britain after an overnight British Airways flight from Los Angeles. They did not bring their children, Archie, two, and ten-month-old Lilibet – who the Queen has still not met.\n\nThey were driven to Frogmore where they spent the night. After his failure to attend his grandfather’s memorial service last month – amid an ongoing legal row with the Home Office over the removal of his police protection – Harry’s offer to visit the Queen was being viewed as an olive branch.\n\nBut the Duke of Sussex upset palace officials and reportedly his father and brother after claiming part of his visit was motivated by \'making sure she’s protected and got the right people around her.’\n\nHarry went on to claim that the Queen tells him things she feels she cannot tell anyone else.\n\nHe said: ‘We have a really special relationship. We talk about things that she can’t talk about with anybody else. So that’s always a nice piece to it.’\n\nHarry and Meghan may come to a \'commuter\' arrangement with the Royal Family after the Queen dies, a royal author has claimed\n\nMeghan would not want to return to the UK for more than a fleeting visit if Harry mends his relationship with his father and brother because \'she disliked England\', the former editor of Vanity Fair has claimed.\n\nMs Brown also noted that the couple\'s exit from royal life was a \'disaster all round\'\n\nTina Brown has said she believes Prince Harry may even want to make a sensational return to the Royal Family after the Queen\'s death - splitting his time between Britain and the US - though Meghan would be unlikely to be fully on board.\n\nMs Brown has described Megxit as a \'disaster for both sides\' and claimed Harry and Meghan caused \'maximum mayhem\' when leaving the Royal Family because they are \'addicted to drama\'.\n\nShe said: \'I think that Harry is going to want to come back when the Queen dies to serve his country. And I think they will find a way to reel him in. And it’s possible that Meghan - maybe they will have a commuter arrangement. I don’t know. I don’t see Meghan ever wanting to go back. She disliked England.\'\n\nMs Brown claimed that the British public are \'very very sad\' about Megxit, because they took Harry to their hearts and also tried to support him when he found love with Meghan. Ms Brown also labelled Prince Harry a \'very impetuous man\' and revealed how Palace advisors \'always thought he would leave\'.\n\nShe said: \'I actually think there is a Harry-shaped hole in the royal family now. And Harry was beloved, actually, by the British people. And people adored Meghan when she came into the mix.\n\n\'So it was actually very, very sad for everybody that it went so wrong because they actually need Harry and Meghan now. You should see, the Queen is failing, and she’s very frail. They kind of need Harry and Meghan to bring that star power and to be on the balcony at the Jubilee. We have to have a royal family up there. We can’t have Andrew up there.\'\n\nThe Queen and Prince Charles are said to be \'keen\' to welcome Harry and Meghan (pictured during Trooping The Colour 2018) to \'family\' events at the Jubilee in June but: \'The ball is in their court\'\n\nThe journalist, Princess Diana\'s biographer, is the author of the new bombshell book The Palace Papers: Inside The House Of Windsor - The Truth And The Turmoil.\n\nSpeaking on a New York Times podcast Sway to promote her new book, she said the couple made \'bad choices\' and could have left the Royal Family on far better terms if they weren\'t as \'hotheaded\'.\n\nMs Brown also labelled Prince Harry a \'very impetuous man\' and revealed how Palace advisors \'always thought he would leave\'.\n\nShe said she was told it was because \'he was so fragile, so combustible, he was so unhappy, frankly, in the constraints of the royal family\'.\n\nHowever, she also noted that the couple\'s exit from royal life was a \'disaster all round\'.\n\nThe Queen and Prince Harry\'s father Prince Charles are both said to very \'keen\' for him, his wife and children to jet in from California to mark the Queen\'s 70 years on the throne.\n\nBuckingham Palace is said to have promised the Sussexes full armed security at all Royal Family events in June in a bid to reassure them after Harry said he felt \'unsafe\' in Britain.\n\nBut despite Her Majesty and Prince Charles removing the main obstacle for Harry, Meghan, Archie and Lilibet attending, the Duke of Sussex is still said to be genuinely undecided about whether to jet in to celebrate his grandmother\'s 70 years on the throne.\n\nA palace source told the Sunday telegraph that \'the ball was in his court\', adding: \'His grandmother and father keen to welcome the Sussexes to “family” events\'.\n\nIt would mean that the Sussexes would be welcomed onto the Buckingham Palace balcony with the rest of the royals to watch a RAF flypast and the Trooping the Colour on June 2, the Queen\'s official birthday.\n\nBut they would be unable to attend working elements of the Jubilee, having quit as frontline royals when they emigrated to Canada and then Los Angeles two years ago.\n\nThe Sussexes recently caused outrage after Harry claimed in an NBC interview that he wanted to make sure his grandmother was \'protected\' and had \'the right people around her\'.\n\nIn an NBC TV appearance, Harry also opened up on his \'special\' relationship with his grandmother, and his very public claim that she confides in him things she cannot talk to anyone else about.\n\nExperts branded the comments a \'gross insult\' to Charles and William, and point out that his and Meghan\'s top secret \'olive branch\' meeting with the Queen at Windsor Castle before the Invictus Games was the first time Harry had seen his grandmother in two years.\n\nThe Queen is all smiles as she heads out this morning on the Sandringham Estate\n\nTina Brown said Sussexes made \'bad choices\' and could have left the Royal Family on far better terms if they weren\'t as \'hotheaded\'\n\nDiscussing the surprise meeting with the Queen, Ms Brown said it could be a sign of things to come.\n\nShe said: It’s a sign of a cautious rapprochement, and I actually think that when the queen dies, I would not be at all surprised if some kind of new charter, as it were, with Harry is drawn up, because I think they’re going to feel they do need Harry in some way.

They also included acts of vandalism and bomb threats to Jewish institutions.\n\nThe group’s tally of total 2,717 incidents last year included 1,776 cases of harassment, a 43% increase from 1,242 in 2020. The ADL also counted a 14% increase in vandalism cases (from 751 in 2020 to 853 last year) and a 167% increase in assault incidents (from 33 in 2020 to 88 last year). The 88 assault incidents involved 131 victims, none of whom were killed, the report says.\n\nThe ADL says it compiles data for its annual audit by evaluating information reported by news media, victims, law enforcement and community leaders. The group says it avoids conflating general criticism of Israel or anti-Israel activism with antisemitism.\n\n“However, Israel-related harassment of identifiable groups or individuals may be included when the harassment incorporated anti-Jewish references, accusations and/or conspiracy theories, or when American Jews are demonized for their real or perceived support of Israel,” the report says.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72a2ed0c6531f5c3a68a83cdcb0db730b9c388cd/0_345_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79daab065eb894f5a89211d41c663b48', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:58'}

Church autonomy\'s defenders have sometimes described the doctrine as establishing distinct spheres of sovereignty for church and state. But critics have argued that church autonomy puts religious institutions above the law. They contend that church autonomy doctrine lacks limiting principles and worry that the "sphere sovereignty" theory of church and state leaves no room for accountability for wrongdoing in religious institutions. The courts, for their part, have recognized that church autonomy must have limits but have struggled to articulate them, leaving the case law in a state of ferment.\n\nThis article makes the case that, contrary to the critics, church autonomy is limited by an accountability principle, itself resting on the same bases that have been used to defend the most robust version of church autonomy. First, the social pluralist theory of sphere sovereignty does not just defend a place for religious institutions to exercise their own self-governance over religious matters; it also has an important place for the state to hold wrongdoers accountable for civil harms. Second, the deep history of church-state relations that has shaped the pro-church autonomy caselaw and scholarship alike also has rich resources to defend a principle of accountability.\n\nAfter presenting the theoretical case for the coexistence of autonomy and accountability principles, this article presents a doctrinal roadmap for how courts can locate the limits of church autonomy. Drawing on doctrinal elements already present in the case law, the approach outlined here can be applied to provide accountability and limit church autonomy in key cases—and it can be done without contradicting any existing Supreme Court doctrine.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:14'}

I have a new paper (forthcoming in the Notre Dame Law Review) about the limits of the church autonomy doctrine—responding, in part, to areas of confusion that have arisen in lower courts applying church autonomy doctrine. I\'ll use some future blog posts this week to get into those issues. Before getting into that, I want to step back to reflect on what\'s going on in the field of "church autonomy doctrine" and how this issue has risen in significance in the last decade.\n\nThe "church autonomy doctrine" is a legal principle of protection for the internal self-governance of religious organizations. (You can find a longer version of this explanation, with more citations, in the law review article.) Church autonomy doctrine protects religious institutions from state control, ensuring that religious organizations can control their own beliefs and internal affairs, or ensuring that the state does not establish a religion. The basics are fairly intuitive: Americans don\'t want the state telling religious bodies whom it can or can\'t retain as a minister, rabbi, or imam, or endorsing the theological distinctives of one side of a church split when the competing factions disagree about what counts as the "true" form of a given faith.\n\nThe church autonomy doctrine applies to all religious institutions, not just churches. While it could be termed "religious autonomy" (or more precisely, autonomy for religious institutions), "church autonomy" remains the most used term in the courts for the body of law that has developed about the internal affairs of religious organizations.\n\nThe church autonomy doctrine is based on both of the religion clauses of the First Amendment. The courts have based church autonomy on both religion clauses of the First Amendment. Interfering with the internal governance of a religious institution would violate religious liberty (free exercise) and establish a religion by allowing the state to dictate the conduct of the religious body. Scholars disagree about whether the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause provides the better foundation, or whether it is best to view church autonomy as the combined effect of the religion clauses, as the Supreme Court has said. But in any case, church autonomy ensures the institutional separation of church and state.\n\nBroadly speaking, this doctrine has two main applications. First, courts should not decide matters that require a particular position on religious doctrine or belief. So if the court is asked to decide whether a member was wrongfully expelled on the basis of the church\'s doctrinal standards, the court should decline. Second, courts should not decide matters that interfere with the religious institution\'s internal governance. As the Supreme Court said in its 2019 decision of Our Lady of Guadalupe School, this "protect[s] their autonomy with respect to internal management decisions that are essential to the institution\'s central mission." This includes selecting ministers, which is known as the "ministerial exception" from employment nondiscrimination law. It also has been long understood to protect churches from defamation lawsuits challenging church discipline proceedings.\n\nSome courts and commentators speak as though there are several different but related doctrines here (church autonomy different from ministerial exception different from ecclesiastical abstention). But I think the better way to think of this is as a single overarching principle—church autonomy—applied in different contexts. That\'s certainly how the Supreme Court has described the issue.\n\nChurch autonomy is not new. One can find a common-law church autonomy principle being articulated by the Supreme Court as early as 1872, even before the First Amendment was applied against the states. (The early history of American church autonomy is fascinating, but I\'ll hold back on that for the present—that\'s the subject of another project I have underway!) Church autonomy principles were thoroughly constitutionalized (that is, articulated as a matter of constitutional law) in a 1952 decision.\n\nBut for a long time, church autonomy remained a backwater. The paradigmatic Free Exercise religious liberty case involved an individual seeking to follow the dictates of individual conscience. The paradigm cases for Establishment Clause principles were government religious practices—school prayer, Ten Commandments in government buildings, and the like.\n\nI first became interested in church autonomy cases when I was in college. My friend Bob Renaud and I noticed that the church autonomy cases engaged with church-state issues that had been historically very important in the history of Christian theology, about the formal institutional authority of church and state. We wrote an article about this. (It was my first law review publication—still in college and not quite knowing how law reviews worked, I was grateful to the law review editors who took a chance on us!) As I finished college, worked, came back to graduate school, and pursued other projects, I kept an eye on church autonomy. And over time, it took on more and more importance.\n\nOver the last decade, most of the Supreme Court\'s high-profile cases about religious liberty involved religious institutions, from church employment decisions in Hosanna Tabor, to corporate conscience in Hobby Lobby, to religious social services in Fulton. The idea that the solitary individual conscience was the paradigm case for First Amendment religion cases has shifted considerably over the last decade.\n\nThe Supreme Court addressed church autonomy issues for the first time in years in Hosanna Tabor, making the church autonomy principle as strong as it has ever been. While controversies swirled over the best way to interpret and apply the Free Exercise clause to conscience claims, religious institutions had robust legal protections for their domain of internal autonomy. Zoë Robinson has perceptively called this decade an era of "religious institutionalism."\n\nChurch autonomy is no longer a backwater. It has taken its place as one of the central Religion Clause doctrines, regularly litigated in the courts. But with that as the case, it\'s particularly important to reflect on the scope and limits of church autonomy. Is church autonomy a praiseworthy principle of religious liberty that appropriately recognizes the communal nature of so much religious faith and practice? Or does it threaten (as its critics charge) to place religious institutions above the law in troubling ways? That\'s a question I\'ll take up in the next post.', 'image': 'https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:30'}

Those checks more than offset the income taxes paid or withheld from the average American’s paychecks.\n\nOf course, even Americans that ostensibly didn’t pay income taxes are now paying the price for those deficit-financed stimulus checks in the form of 8.5% inflation. And besides the income tax, working Americans—directly or indirectly—pay plenty of other taxes, from the payroll tax to tariffs.\n\nAmericans pay more federal taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product today than the historical norm .\n\nThe federal government doesn’t suffer from a lack of tax dollars. Fundamentally, the government has a spending problem.\n\nIn 2019, Americans collectively paid more in taxes than they did on food, clothing, and housing combined. And unless Washington changes course, taxes will consume a larger and larger share of households’ budgets in the future.\n\nOver the past decade, the federal debt has nearly doubled to over $30 trillion due to reckless spending by Congress. This is a burden that all Americans share.\n\nThere are two real solutions that Congress must enact for a more fiscally sound and economically prosperous country.\n\nFirst, Congress must address its out-of-control spending. Government spending has increased 266% over the past 20 years compared to GDP growth of only 112% over that same period. The biggest driver has been the growth of entitlement programs.\n\nOver the past 20 years , Social Security spending has grown from $433 billion to $1.1 trillion. Other programs have grown even more rapidly, such as Medicare, which has more than tripled from $217 billion all the way up to $696 billion.\n\nIncome security programs increased by more than six times over the last two decades to over $1.6 trillion, making it the largest area of spending in the entire budget in 2021. While some of this growth stems from the pandemic, the trend is true of all major entitlement programs: growth in spending has far outpaced inflation and GDP growth.\n\nSecondly, to reduce the unnecessary burden on the American people, Congress should fix the broken U.S. tax code, which is incoherent and inconsistent. Like a parody of Frankenstein’s monster, the tens of thousands of pages of U.S. tax rules are haphazardly pieced together.\n\nThe federal government doesn’t just impose an income tax. There is also the payroll tax, a 15.3% tax on wages split between the “employer contribution” and employee wage withholding. The employer contribution is supposedly paid by businesses.\n\nHowever, since all employers face this tax for paying employee wages, it drives down market wages, leaving workers bearing the brunt of both sides of the payroll tax in the form of lower upfront pay and lower take-home pay.\n\nThere are fuel taxes and other excise taxes, death taxes, capital gains taxes, and tariffs, not to mention many burdensome taxes that both state and local governments impose. American workers even bear the brunt of the corporate income tax.\n\nA result of our disjointed patchwork system of taxation is that it leaves most Americans unaware of how much tax they pay or how much those taxes harm them economically.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in the current income tax system is the inclusion of hundreds of tax breaks to politically favored entities that distort markets and allow the government to pick “winners” and subjugates others to an uneven playing field.\n\nThe winners, all too often, are those with a strong political lobby.\n\nCongress needs to create a neutral tax code and eliminate tax credits and other provisions that give tax benefits to specific political interests or select activities. Doing this will diminish outside influence and allow a more level playing field for everyone, including everyday American taxpayers who lack political influence.\n\nOur broken tax system is an enormous drain on the economy. Taxes distort prices and draw resources away from more productive activities to less productive activities with tax advantages.\n\nAn unnecessarily complex tax code also directly consumes Americans’ time and resources, Americans dedicate at least 6 billion hours per year navigating convoluted tax rules that span tens of thousands of pages. Every hour dedicated to tax compliance is an hour that Americans can’t spend on more productive or worthwhile activities.\n\nThe current tax code may work well for accountants, lawyers, lobbyists, and certain special interests, but it generally doesn’t work well for Americans, rich or poor.\n\nPolicymakers should craft legislation that restores neutrality and transparency to the tax code and ensures more equal treatment for all Americans. The tax code shouldn’t be just another tool for people in Washington to exert their influence into all aspects of Americans’ lives and businesses.\n\nCongress should take responsibility for its overspending and the broken tax code it built, instead of asking the American people to pay for Washington’s irresponsible policies.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in the Daily Signal and is reprinted with kind permission from the Heritage Foundation.', 'image': 'https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7765934/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2722+0+38/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2F3c%2Ff6bd509e3c0948ae92522ad3a873%2F2ed0d44b51389d63c578e2c113050c0d.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:16'}

That led to taxes being deferred for future payment, as well as a decreased overall tax burden, it said.\n\n"Charter pays significant income taxes in most state and local jurisdictions and will be a meaningful federal cash tax payer this year," the telecommunications company said.\n\nInsurance giant AIG pointed to a 2021 regulatory filing that stated that its effective tax rate on continuing operations was 18% that year. The CAP analysis doesn\'t include deferred taxes, which companies often self-report as part of their current effective tax rate, nor does it include foreign taxes.\n\nAmazon said its U.S. taxes "reflect our investments, employee compensation and current tax laws."\n\n"In 2021, we reported $2.3 billion in federal income tax expense, $5.2 billion in other federal taxes, and more than $4 billion in state and local taxes of all types," a spokesperson said in a statement. We also collected an additional $22 billion in sales taxes for U.S. states and localities."\n\nA spokesperson for chemicals maker Dow disputed CAP\'s findings, saying the report "mischaracterizes Dow\'s tax reporting by simply taking the company\'s current tax expense for 2021 as a percentage of domestic income for the same year." The company complies with all tax laws, both in the U.S. and internationally, the company said.\n\nThe spokesperson added, "In doing so, it disregards deferred taxes, which CAP acknowledges, but CAP\'s analysis of taxes paid is further distorted (reduced) by tax adjustments that relate to prior years and therefore have nothing to do with Dow\'s 2021 domestic income."\n\nCorporate tax rates in previous eras were much higher, Hanlon noted. "If you look historically, corporations paid much higher rates — both the nominal rate and the effective rates were much higher in previous decades, and they fell even further in 2017," he said. "It hasn\'t always been this way."', 'image': 'https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/18/79eec01d-b1de-4009-830a-beef5427fc0d/thumbnail/1200x630/33a62399db8e69192c7d0c779b2d9093/cbsn-fusion-2022-tax-filing-deadline-arrives-for-all-americans-thumbnail-968813-640x360.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:03:38'}

However, an influential physician task force issued a major update on the protocol on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Service Task Force said that it finalized its latest recommendation on daily doses of aspirin, saying that individuals aged 60 and older should not begin to take one aspirin per day to prevent heart problems in most cases. They cited possible health risks, including aspirin’s blood-thinning ability.\n\nIt noted that while daily aspirin usage has been associated with a lower chance of suffering a first heart attack or stroke, it runs the risk of “bleeding in the stomach, intestines, and brain,” the Task Force said. “The chance of bleeding increases with age and can be life-threatening.”\n\nAspirin, which is an anti-inflammatory drug, can help prevent blood clots from forming, according to studies. But because of its blood-thinning properties, some studies have shown, daily aspirin use can cause gastrointestinal bleeding or a stroke caused by a hemorrhagic, or bleeding, stroke.\n\n“Based on new evidence since the 2016 Task Force recommendation, it is now recommended that once people turn 60 years old, they should not consider starting to take aspirin because the risk of bleeding cancels out the benefits of preventing heart disease,” added the Task Force in its statement (pdf).\n\nPeople aged 40 to 59 with at least a 10 percent chance of 10-year cardiovascular disease should consider taking daily aspirin, said the group.\n\n“Daily aspirin use may help prevent heart attacks and strokes in some people, but it can also cause potentially serious harms, such as internal bleeding,” John Wong, a member of the influential group, said in a statement. “It’s important that people who are 40 to 59 years old and don’t have a history of heart disease have a conversation with their clinician to decide together if starting to take aspirin is right for them.”\n\nDr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, told ABC News that the public should understand that “for the vast majority of Americans without pre-existing heart disease, aspirin does not provide a net benefit.”\n\n“The harms are approximately equal to any benefits. The [Task Force] is just catching up with this widely accepted scientific viewpoint. For nearly 20 years the FDA has advised against routine use of aspirin for prevention in patients without heart disease,” he added.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the top killer in the United States annually, according to data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

(Stock iamge)\n\nWHAT IS ASPIRIN? Aspirin is an everyday painkiller for aches and pains such as headache, toothache and period pain. It can also be used to treat colds and 'flu-like' symptoms, and to bring down a high temperature. It is also known as acetylsalicylic acid. Aspirin is also available combined with other ingredients in some cold and flu remedies. You can buy most types of aspirin from pharmacies, shops and supermarkets. Some types are only available on prescription. It comes as tablets or anal suppositories. It also comes as a gel for mouth ulcers and cold sores. If you've had a stroke or heart attack or are at high risk of a heart attack, your doctor may recommend that you take a daily low-dose aspirin. This is different to taking aspirin for pain relief. Only take low-dose aspirin if your doctor recommends it. Source: NHS Advertisement\n\nAlmost two decades ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended the pills should not be taken to prevent a first heart attack or stroke.

Those are the issues. The tape’s not.”\n\nWith Trump himself also seeming to revel in the power he exerted through the McCarthy-tape episode, its effect on the California Republican’s future speakership prospects is looking questionable so far. While other factors may yet affect the strength of McCarthy’s hold on the gavel should his party retake the House next year, even some Trump allies who voted to block certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory were undeterred.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who’s also close to McCarthy, said simply that “I’m for Donald Trump being the next president and Kevin McCarthy being the next speaker.”\n\nStill, not all Republicans are ready to let the episode fade. The McCarthy tapes could be easy ammunition for Republicans who want to squeeze McCarthy for concessions or for new conference members who want to make a name for themselves with the party base as ready to challenge leadership.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who chaired the Trump-allied House Freedom Caucus until January, told the conservative One America News Network that McCarthy’s comments in the audio “undermined” colleagues who had voted to object to the election.\n\nBiggs added to OANN that McCarthy wasn’t “candid” with other House Republicans that a potential Trump-resignation call was under consideration, and also rapped the GOP leader’s recorded observations about removing some vocal Trump acolytes from social media.\n\nStill, few Republicans were willing to criticize their leader when they arrived back in the Capitol on Tuesday night, their first in-person gathering since the explosive New York Times report last Thursday.\n\nAlabama Rep. Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, argued that audio was a “nothingburger” that was taken “completely out of context.”\n\n“They were talking about if they had the impeachment hearings, and he was impeached,” Rogers said of Trump. McCarthy, he added, was merely offering a recommendation that Trump step aside before Democrats successfully removed him from the White House.\n\nIn the early days of January 2021, at the time of McCarthy’s recorded call, some House Republicans were wagering that the Senate could vote to convict Trump.\n\n“It’s all inside baseball. Not a single constituent brought up that issue to me,” Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) said of the McCarthy tape as he walked out of a meeting of senior Republicans.\n\n“Nobody’s talking about it,” Davis added. “And frankly, I can’t wait till Speaker McCarthy is sworn in.”\n\nThe Times’ initial report on McCarthy’s post-insurrection comments — followed a day later by its release of audio from a private GOP meeting — jolted the House Republican conference at a time when many of its members are eager for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol to retreat from view. McCarthy’s members would much prefer to focus on their efforts to retake the majority come November.\n\nIn the recording, McCarthy is heard telling then-GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) that he was “seriously thinking” of speaking to Trump directly about whether he should resign after the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe California Republican also told his leadership team on the tape that Trump had personally acknowledged at least some role in goading the rioters that day (which POLITICO reported at the time, citing multiple people with knowledge of the conversation).\n\nTrump “told me he does have some responsibility for what happened and he’d need to acknowledge that,” McCarthy said in the phone call.\n\nSome close to Trump have suggested the former president is not angry about the audio — instead, he sees it as a sign of his power because both the Senate and House GOP leaders appeared ready to turn on him after the Capitol siege and have since softened their approach. Of course, that could change; others say Trump is known for sitting on information that he can later use to deploy against someone who has slighted him.\n\nIn Biggs’ interview with OANN, he took particular issue with Cheney’s participation in the discussion about how to respond to Trump, despite the fact that the call occurred when she would still be expected to participate as a member of GOP leadership. Serious efforts to oust her from the conference’s upper echelons didn’t get underway until weeks after the taped call.\n\n“It is incredibly undermining when we were back in the heat of that” time after the riot by Trump supporters, Biggs told the conservative outlet. “And we have a leader basically negotiating with Liz Cheney over whether he should resign or not, [which] becomes a huge trust issue for me.”\n\nMcCarthy, notably, didn’t quite see Biggs’ remarks as suggesting that the recording could affect his trust in his leader.\n\n“I don’t think that’s what he said,” McCarthy said of Biggs in a brief interview Tuesday night.\n\n“Did you ask Jim Jordan?” the minority leader added, saying that the matter didn’t come up in GOP meetings that afternoon.', 'image': 'https://static.politico.com/30/cc/dfd2767043fcb6b6f61693aeccb7/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1386263721', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:37'}

It comes at a consequential moment for the Republican Party as it looks to take control of the House in November — a situation that would likely hand McCarthy the Speaker’s gavel.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) last week accused McCarthy of standing by Cheney, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a frequent critic of Trump and McCarthy, said that the minority leader “ought to be ashamed” for lying about the comments.\n\nBiggs told OAN he has “several problems” with the tapes, including that McCarthy was “undermining” the Republican conference when others were working to defend Trump.\n\nHe also took issue with McCarthy not being candid with his Republican colleagues.\n\n“He was not candid with conference. He wasn’t telling us what his position was,” Biggs said. “And the fact that he was working with Liz Cheney, who was always a ‘Never Trumper,’ is particularly problematic as well. So he was dissembling to the conference.”\n\nThe third point Biggs criticized was a comment McCarthy made on the call in which he, according to the Times, said he wished large tech companies would boot some GOP lawmakers from social media platforms, similar to what Twitter and Facebook did to Trump after the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nMcCarthy’s spokesman, however, told the newspaper that the Republican leader “never said particular members should be removed from Twitter.”\n\nBiggs told OAN that the remark from McCarthy was “problematic.”\n\n“The third thing, and this is perhaps the most serious thing as well — I mean, all of these are serious — is that he is recorded as saying that if we supported Trump, that we should be removed from our social media platforms,” Biggs said.\n\nThe Arizona Republican said he wished McCarthy had been “honest and truthful” with the GOP conference at the time of the comments so they would not be an issue now, when the party is looking ahead to the midterms.\n\n“The unfortunate thing for us now is if he would have just been honest and truthful to us way back then, this would not be an issue today, and we don’t want it to be an issue because we don’t want it to be a distraction because we are moving forward … [with] tremendous momentum to retake the house,” he added.\n\nBiggs said he has “no reason to doubt” that McCarthy’s comments on the call were his “true intentions and feelings.”\n\nThe Hill reached out to McCarthy for comment.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/biggsandy_102121gn_lead.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:59'}

And unlike most gubernatorial races, DeSantis has been seeing a range of payments -- small and large -- from states like California, Virginia, Ohio and others.\n\nOne of his Democratic opponents, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, pointed out the geographical breadth of DeSantis' donors in a recent press conference.\n\n'He is raising dollars outside, mostly, from the state of Florida for his run for president in 2024 and using the people of our state in order to get there,' Fried said.\n\nCampaign finance laws however prohibit the governor from funneling his state campaign cash into a federal operation.\n\nThat hasn't stopped Democrats from trying to raise their own cash off fears that DeSantis would mount his own White House bid.\n\nHouse Democrats' campaign arm, known as the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee, sent out a fundraising email on Tuesday highlighting a recent straw poll that apparently showed the Sunshine State's governor toward the top of a list of potential Republican presidential candidates.\n\n'And we’ll be honest. The thought of Ron DeSantis in the White House is HORRIFYING,' the urgently worded email read.\n\nTwo days during which DeSantis' campaign blasted out anti-Disney fundraising emails saw a combined sum of nearly $50,000 in donations\n\nIt went on to accuse him of attacking reproductive rights and public schools, undermining democracy and 'smearing Dr. Fauci' while 'parroting Donald Trump's election lies.'\n\n'It’s downright scary that such a dangerous figure is one of the GOP’s leading choices for President of the United States,' the DCCC stated.\n\nMeanwhile Democrats and progressives continue trying to take down the Republican governor, with some critics accusing him of using Florida to raise his national profile\n\nDeSantis' spokeswoman Christina Pushaw told DailyMail.com that the governor remains focused on his re-election bid in Florida and directed further questions to his campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile recent reforms passed under DeSantis are guaranteed to have a significant impact on millions of Floridians.\n\nThat includes signing a bill last week that revoked Disney's special self-governing arrangement on its 25,000-acre Disney World property.\n\nDisney, among the state's largest employers, was granted a specific tax status more than half a century ago allowing it to essentially run its own municipal government over the area.\n\nRevoking that status will not only likely raise taxes on Disney -- which has saved millions -- but also families in the area, according to estimates.\n\nFlorida residents living in Orlando and Osceola counties could see an additional tax burden of as much as $2,800, one local legislator told CNN.\n\nLast week, the Sunshine State's legislature passed the governor's proposal for a new Congressional district map that is expected to give Republicans a whopping four new seats and likely erasing three Democratic ones.\n\nThe map gives Republicans an advantage in 18 districts compared to just eight for Democrats, according to a breakdown by FiveThirtyEight.\n\nOnly two seats in the entire state are ranked as competitive toss-ups.\n\nMeanwhile House Democrats are fundraising off of left-wing fears that DeSantis could run for president in the 2024 cycle\n\nFlorida's GOP-dominated legislature voted on the map along party lines despite impassioned protests from the other side of the aisle.\n\nFor his own part, DeSantis has not said whether he's interested in running for president in 2024, deflecting any questions by insisting his focus remains on getting re-elected in Florida in November.\n\nBut his resistance to ruling the idea out altogether has reportedly rankled former President Donald Trump, according to previous reports.\n\nTrump's support of DeSantis launched him from another member of Congress from Florida to a Republican superstar and into the governor's mansion in Tallahassee.\n\nBoth politicians have dismissed rumors that they have anything other than a 'good relationship.'\n\nTrump also still comes out ahead of DeSantis in most polls of Republican voters.

Kurt Schrader (Ore.), a centrist Democrat locked in a contentious primary.\n\n“We don’t always agree, but when it has mattered most, Kurt has been there for me,” Biden said in a statement. “And in doing so, he has helped to pass much of my agenda into law ― making a huge difference in the lives of the Oregonians he represents and all of America.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Now we have a lot more to do and to get it done we need to keep a Democratic Congress,” he added. “Kurt Schrader has had my back from early on and played an important part in the progress we have made as a nation.”\n\nBiden visited Portland, Oregon, last Thursday to celebrate the administration’s infrastructure investments. All of Oregon’s Democratic members of Congress, including Schrader, were present. Biden name-checked Schrader, saying he’d “played a key part in the progress we’ve made as a nation on jobs, economic growth and clean energy.”\n\nSchrader, one of Congress’ most conservative Democrats, faces a challenge from progressive attorney Jamie McLeod-Skinner in the May 17 primary for Oregon’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nMcLeod-Skinner, who has tried to present herself to voters as a better ally for Biden than Schrader has been, expressed polite disagreement with Biden’s decision and suggested it was evidence of Schrader’s desperation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The fact that Schrader is calling in political favors from national Democrats shows he knows our campaign of working people in Oregon is stronger than ever,” she said in a statement.\n\nOregon’s 5th remains a Democratic-leaning seat, but redistricting has made it slightly less of a sure bet for the party. Biden won the old district, centered more in Portland’s suburbs and exurbs, by about 10 percentage points, but he would have won the new seat, which includes large swaths of rural central and Eastern Oregon, by about 9 points.\n\nJamie McLeod-Skinner, left, is challenging Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), right, on the grounds that he is not a good ally to President Joe Biden. Associated Press/Getty\n\nAs a result, House Democrats’ official campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has taken an active role in Schrader’s primary race, maintaining that a different Democratic nominee would be more vulnerable in a possible Republican wave year.\n\nBut progressives backing McLeod-Skinner were disappointed in Biden’s announcement, arguing that it rewards one of the Democratic Party’s least cooperative members and will discourage progressive base voters from showing up in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Midterms are about enthusiasm. The party out of power has it, and the party in power doesn’t,” tweeted the Working Families Party, which is backing McLeod-Skinner. “Democrats can reverse that trend, but to do it they need to embrace working-class candidates like [McLeod-Skinner], not corporate incumbents who undermine their popular agenda.”\n\nLeah Greenberg, a co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, which is also backing McLeod-Skinner, pitched McLeod-Skinner as a truer fighter for Biden’s agenda.\n\n“If you want someone who will actually deliver on the Democratic agenda, there’s only one choice,” Greenberg tweeted.\n\nSchrader has indeed broken with Biden to a degree that’s rare for a Democrat who hails from a district Biden carried. Schrader voted against the COVID-19 relief bill that passed the House in February 2021, before approving the version sent back by the Senate. He joined other moderate Democrats in helping decouple the ambitious Build Back Better legislation from the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which many observers believe undermined the former’s chances of passing. And taking advantage of Democrats’ narrow margins in the House, Schrader insisted on watering down Biden’s prescription drug negotiation bill as a condition for his support.\n\nIn response to Schrader’s actions, McLeod-Skinner has attracted an unusual level of support for a primary challenger from organized labor and local Democrats, including four county Democratic parties.\n\nNonetheless, Schrader is the front-runner ― not least due to his major campaign cash advantage. Thanks in part to his status as a darling of the pharmaceutical industry, Schrader has spent nearly $2 million defending his seat, and benefited from the independent support of a Big Pharma-backed super PAC.', 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6266cc31240000113696fcde.jpeg?cache=fUreORKgCu&ops=1778_1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:05:09'}

Biden\'s agenda has frequently stalled in the Senate, with the least liberal members of the caucus able to block any bill that lacks bipartisan support.\n\nA spokesperson for the DSCC told the Washington Examiner that the committee\'s primary goal heading into the midterm elections is "working to defend our battleground incumbents" in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and New Hampshire, but beyond that, the DSCC will take "advantage of every opportunity" Republicans give it.\n\nPRICES, NOT PUTIN: BIDEN ALLIES FRANTICALLY SOUND THE ALARM AHEAD OF MIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\n"The wave of Republican retirements has created some opportunities in that space, as well as [Wisconsin Republican Sen.] Ron Johnson\'s poor approval rating," that person added.\n\nJohnson is the only Wisconsin Republican to win a Senate race in four decades, and Democratic operatives have put a target on the seat after he announced his reelection campaign in January. Meanwhile, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio is facing a challenge from sitting Democratic Rep. Val Demings, the first black woman to serve as Orlando\'s chief of police, and the race to replace retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr in North Carolina remains wide open ahead of the primaries.\n\nMehmet Oz and J.D. Vance are down in Republican primary polls in Pennsylvania and Ohio, respectively. Former President Donald Trump\'s endorsement could push them through to the general, though the DSCC expects the tone of the primaries, with Trump\'s expected close involvement, to turn off centrist Republican voters.\n\n"We\'ve seen across the battleground states this year, really, Trump creating more chaos in these GOP primaries that have already been, really, kind of nasty, expensive, and chaotic," a DSCC official said of the situation. "When Trump kind of interferes, they get even nastier, even more expensive, and even more chaotic, and so we\'re really feeling like these GOP primaries are messy and lead to a liability for the general election electorate."\n\nDSCC Chairman Gary Peters previously stated he was "confident" Democrats will unseat Johnson and, like Biden, has predicted walking away from the midterm elections with two more seats in hand.\n\n"We’ll be working really closely with the president. He cares deeply about the Senate," Peters told Politico of Biden\'s stated plan to campaign openly throughout 2022. To me, the president’s always an asset."\n\nThe president opened 2022 by promising to hit the road more to interact with voters and campaign for vulnerable Democrats, but his ability to travel has been hindered by coordinating the West\'s response to the war in Ukraine. Biden visited Greensboro, North Carolina, in recent weeks to lobby support for his plan to boost manufacturing and tout the administration\'s outreach to historically black colleges and universities, but he has not stopped by Pennsylvania, Ohio, or Wisconsin at nearly the same clip set by his first year in office.\n\nThe president and allies did ramp up messaging in April around Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott\'s 11-point proposal to "tax poor people," according to one senior Democratic official.\n\n"Republicans are putting their foot in their mouth and highlighting what a Republican majority would look like," the official told the Washington Examiner. "I think that is going to be motivating for a lot of people as we get through the summer and you see more ads. [Democratic] voters will become much more enthusiastic as they tune into the election."\n\n"The president is going to continue fighting for middle-class tax relief and to make sure the richest Americans and largest corporations don’t pay a lower rate than middle-class families,” the White House said in a Tax Day statement criticizing Scott\'s plan. “And he will fight against the Republican plan to raise taxes on middle-class families and to threaten the future of Social Security and Medicare while continuing giant handouts to the very top and the largest corporations.”\n\nRepublican campaign officials, however, have sought to tie vulnerable Democrats to Biden\'s approval rating, which, after a slight bump during the opening weeks of the war, has sunk back down to a term low in RealClearPolitics\'s polling average.\n\n"What a great day to be a New Hampshire Republican. Today, voters everywhere will be reminded that Maggie Hassan helped Joe Biden bring his failed agenda to life every step of the way," National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman T.W.

Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted it would report revenue of around $49 billion and net income of around $16 billion for the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft shares rose more than 6% in after-hours trading after it unveiled a strong outlook on sales for the current quarter.\n\nThrough the pandemic, Microsoft and other business-software companies experienced booming stock prices and sales as organizations around the world used more digital tools to help with remote working. This has bolstered demand for Microsoft’s office applications as well as its cloud-infrastructure services.\n\nThe Department of Justice is investigating the U.S.'s largest tech firms for allegedly monopolistic behavior. Roughly 20 years ago, a similar case threatened to destabilize Microsoft. WSJ explains.\n\nMicrosoft remains the second-largest cloud-infrastructure vendor behind Amazon.com Inc., AMZN -4.58% but the company has been gaining market share by using its leadership in office applications as leverage to grab big deals for its Azure cloud. It had nearly 20% of the market in 2020, according to research firm Gartner Inc. —well behind Amazon Web Services’ 40%, but up from 7% in 2016.\n\nThe company’s overall cloud business was up 32% with $23.4 billion in sales as its rival to Amazon cloud infrastructure service grew 46%.\n\nAnalysts and investors have been looking for signs that demand is cooling. Software shares have been sliding this year, with Microsoft down around 20%, in line with the Nasdaq Composite Index.\n\nResults were largely in line with expectations. There were concerns that a slowdown might be on the horizon after the previous quarterly earnings were reported in January because the growth of Microsoft’s cloud service Azure for that quarter hadn’t been as strong as expected. Growth seems to be back on track now, analysts said, showing companies continue to spend on cloud services.\n\n“This is a good bellwether for the rest of software,” said Rishi Jaluria, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “There’s no big slowdown in the spending environment.”\n\nMicrosoft is showing little sign of slowdown despite the war in Ukraine, inflation and other factors that have been hurting growth in many industries. The company expects its sales for the current quarter to be between $52.4 billion and $53.2 billion. Analysts had been expecting sales of around $52.8 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the war in Ukraine is expected to have around a $110 million sales impact on the company in the current quarter.\n\nMicrosoft’s cloud-market push has come under criticism in Europe, where rivals have filed antitrust complaints. Last summer, French company OVHcloud filed one over licensing terms that it says make Microsoft products more expensive to use on non-Microsoft clouds.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman said in response to the complaint that it is continuously evaluating how it can best work with partners.\n\nMicrosoft has had a busy year. In January, it announced its biggest-ever acquisition with its $75 billion offer for Activision Blizzard Inc., developer of such popular videogame franchises as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. The deal is expected to bolster Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service, which offers a library of games for a monthly fee.\n\nThe videogame arm generated close to 10% of Microsoft’s revenue in 2021. The company is trying to build it into another core business, by using its cloud infrastructure to take the lead in an emerging cloud-gaming sector.\n\nMicrosoft’s total gaming revenue grew 6% for the quarter, while its Xbox content and services sales advanced 4%. Its console sales for the quarter increased 14%.\n\nMicrosoft has seen a surge in usage of its subscription service after adding new games, said Satya Nadella, chief executive at Microsoft. He said the number of hours played had jumped 45% from a year ago.\n\nMicrosoft doesn’t expect the Activision deal, being reviewed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, to close until next year. New Chairwoman Lina Khan has taken steps to increase scrutiny of deals. If it does close, Microsoft said it would become the third-largest gaming company by sales, with 30 game studios under its management.\n\nWrite to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com", 'image': 'https://images.wsj.net/im-528302/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:47'}

Key priorities on the docket include advancing much-needed pandemic aid, approving legislation to strengthen the US supply chain, and passing a diluted version of Build Back Better.\n\n“This year really means five remaining months, one of which is August, [when] very little gets done,” White House chief of staff Ron Klain said in a recent interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd. “And so we really have to move the key pieces of legislation left [in] the House and Senate with tempo.”\n\nHere are some of the bills lawmakers are eyeing as they get back in session — and how likely they are to pass.\n\nPandemic aid\n\nWhat it is: For weeks, the White House has been urging Congress to pass more pandemic funding to help purchase treatments, tests, and vaccines. Lawmakers, however, have struggled to approve this aid due to disagreements about how it should be paid for and a Republican push to add amendments addressing some of their legislative priorities.\n\nWhere it stands: Right before the recess, Democrats and Republicans reached an agreement in the Senate on $10 billion in Covid-19 relief, much less than the $22.5 billion the White House initially requested. This would be paid for using unspent funds that different agencies received as part of last year’s American Rescue Plan.\n\nSenate Republicans, however, refused to move forward with a vote on the aid unless lawmakers considered an amendment preserving Title 42, a Trump-era immigration policy that enables the US government to block noncitizens from entering the country due to public health concerns. Many public health officials have long argued Title 42 is ineffective at stopping the spread of Covid-19, and President Joe Biden is now rolling that policy back.\n\nLawmakers have yet to resolve their disagreement over the path forward.\n\n“It is the height of hypocrisy to end this important public health tool at the very same moment Democrats are seeking billions more for Covid,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) told Vox in a statement about Title 42. “The Biden administration can’t have it both ways and Republicans will fight to keep Title 42 safeguards in place before any additional taxpayer money is considered.”\n\nSeveral House Democrats had also expressed concerns about the deal because it did not include funding for global vaccine distribution.\n\n“Until Senate Republicans get their act together, this is all very fluid,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) told Vox in a statement. “There’s no doubt that we need this domestic funding right now, but I and many of my colleagues need firm assurances from the White House that we will get robust global Covid funding to accompany the next Ukrainian aid package.”\n\nBoth pandemic relief and Ukraine aid could ultimately be bundled into one bill. Previously, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had floated the option as a way to address the omission of global aid, though other provisions could be added, too.\n\n“It is my intention for the Senate to consider a bipartisan international appropriations package that could include additional aid for Ukraine as well as funding to address Covid-19 and food insecurity globally,” Schumer said in an April statement.\n\nWhat are the prospects it will pass? Approving more pandemic aid is a major priority for Congress since the US could run out of money for therapies and booster shots by late May. Last weekend, Ashish Jha, the head of the White House’s Covid-19 response effort, pressed lawmakers to vote on the issue once they were back in session.\n\nIts prospects for passing are still uncertain, however. Democratic leaders still have to confront the ongoing impasse over Title 42, a difficult task given moderates in their own party don’t support rescinding it, either. It’s an issue that’s likely to affect the bill even if it’s packaged with Ukraine aid.\n\nUkraine aid\n\nWhat it is: Last week, the White House announced that it would request more aid for Ukraine as Russia’s military invasion continues.\n\n“I’m going to be sending to Congress a supplemental budget request to keep weapons and ammunition flowing without interruption to brave Ukrainian fighters and to continue to deliver economic assistance to the Ukrainian people,” Biden said in remarks on Thursday. “My hope is, and my expectation is, that Congress will move and act quickly.”\n\nPreviously, Congress had approved $13.6 billion in military and humanitarian aid, as well as economic sanctions aimed at Russian trade.\n\nWhere it stands: Biden has yet to specify how much aid he’s looking for Congress to approve, though he has called for lawmakers to consider it swiftly when he does.\n\nWhat are the prospects it could pass? So far, support for Ukraine has been notably bipartisan. Previously, humanitarian aid and economic sanctions passed with Republican support. If this trend continues, it’s likely this package could do the same.\n\nDemocratic leaders have also signaled that they may try to combine this funding with pandemic aid. If they do, it could wind up making this legislation more contentious for Republicans, who’ve been eager to help Ukraine but less interested in approving more Covid-19 funding.\n\n“If that [Covid-19 aid] discussion is going to take a matter of weeks, we have to make a decision on Ukrainian support in a matter of hours or days,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) told Politico.\n\nUS Innovation and Competition Act\n\nWhat it is: This legislation would invest in scientific research, fund the development of new technologies, and bolster US production of semiconductors in an attempt to make the country more competitive on the global stage.\n\nWhere it stands: The Senate and the House have both passed their own versions of the bill, which have been dubbed the Innovation and Competition Act, and the America Competes Act, respectively.\n\nLawmakers have since started what’s known as a conference committee in order to reconcile the differences between the two bills. The Senate still needs to hold a vote officially approving the committee, but talks are already beginning on different subjects.\n\nCurrently, there are significant differences between the two bills on issues like trade, how funding to the National Science Foundation will be applied, and foreign policies related to the Chinese government.\n\n“I’m spending a lot of time working to get agreement on the trade title,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), a member of the conference committee, said in a statement. “Democrats are largely aligned on our goals, but there are some big differences.”\n\nWhat are the prospects it will pass? Since the House and Senate have already approved their takes on this legislation, it’s evident that this is an important priority for lawmakers in both chambers.\n\nAs a Democratic House aide told Vox, there’s a sense that this could be the last large bill this Congress passes, and as a result, lawmakers from both parties will attempt to add unrelated measures to the package. That makes whether they will be able to work through their disagreements, however, an open question.\n\nHouse resolution enabling staffers to unionize\n\nWhat it is: Staffers in Congress currently have the right to unionize, but they lack the protections to do so — meaning they could be fired and blacklisted if they try. The House and Senate respectively need to pass resolutions that guarantee staffers these protections before they can start organizing.\n\nWhere it stands: Rep. Andy Levin (D-MI) first introduced a resolution in the House in February and needs to fix a drafting error in it before it can move forward, according to two Democratic aides. Union organizers argue that the fix is straightforward and shouldn’t delay a floor vote.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) is also expected to introduce a similar resolution in the Senate, though it’s less likely to pass there since 10 Republicans would have to sign on. House offices, however, would be able to begin unionizing even if the Senate does not.\n\nWhat are the prospects it will pass? House leaders had previously expressed strong support for staffers’ ability to unionize, and 165 Democrats have already signed on as co-sponsors to Levin’s resolution.\n\nThe question now centers on if 50 or so other Democrats will vote in favor of the resolution and whether House leadership will actually bring it to the floor.\n\n“All of leadership, at this point, has expressed support, has paid lip service,” an organizer with the Congressional Workers Union (CWU) previously told Vox. “And then they haven’t brought it to the floor.”\n\nA new version of the bill formerly known as Build Back Better\n\nWhat it is: Democrats are still scrambling to pass a version of Build Back Better, their social spending and climate legislation. While Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), a pivotal Democratic holdout, announced that he couldn’t vote for the prior iteration of the bill, he has left the door open for a narrower measure.\n\nWhere it stands: There hasn’t been much movement on what a specific proposal could include.\n\nMost recently, Manchin has said he’d consider legislation that invests in climate provisions and reduces prescription drug prices, as long as half the revenue from the bill is used to pay down the deficit.\n\nHe has yet to offer a concrete commitment to any bill, though, meaning any path forward is still uncertain.\n\nWhat are the prospects it will pass? Democrats are hoping they could rally around some form of the legislation ahead of the midterms, though their chances of doing so are looking increasingly slim.\n\nBecause the bill is so dependent on Manchin’s support, it’s hard to imagine any policy coming to fruition until he explicitly and publicly backs it.\n\nInsulin pricing legislation\n\nWhat it is: If Democrats are unable to pass a version of the Build Back Better legislation, they could turn to more modest bills that address prescription drug prices. One of these measures aims to reduce the out-of-pocket cost of insulin.\n\nWhere it stands: The House recently passed legislation that would cap the price of insulin at $35 per month for insured patients, a major change from the hundreds of dollars that many currently pay per month. (The bill, however, doesn’t apply to uninsured patients and does not change the cost of the actual drug.)\n\nThe Senate, meanwhile, will consider its own version of the bill, which is being helmed by Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). Shaheen’s office notes that they’re expecting to introduce the bill during the upcoming legislative session.\n\nAccording to a list of priorities the two senators unveiled in early April, the legislation aims to incentivize pharmaceutical companies and insurers to reduce the list price for insulin.\n\nWhat are the prospects it will pass? The Senate still needs to pass its take on the legislation and then the House will have to consider it. That would require 10 Senate Republicans to sign onto the bill, which is a challenging feat during an election year despite bipartisan interest in lowering prescription drug prices.', 'image': 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wJtWzQJ_unFRbv9Pyb30mvIIcdQ=/0x0:5096x2668/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23409896/1239812258.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:43'}

(Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk’s Twitter: What’s Next for the Social Network?\n\nTwitter’s Board of Directors officially accepted Elon Musk’s offer of $54.20 per share in cash, valuing the company at around $44 billion. The deal would allow Musk to take the 16-year-old social media platform private and implement a wide range of changes to the struggling tech firm.\n\nThere are still many hurdles to overcome for the transaction to be completed. It will be difficult to ascertain how long the regulatory process will take, while experts expect that it will likely be a few weeks before the stock is delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nLooking ahead, investors, market analysts, and users have plenty of questions regarding the future of the “de facto public town square.”\n\nWho Will Lead Twitter 2.0?\n\nWill Musk keep Parag Agrawal as CEO, or will he appoint a new CEO? What about the Board of Directors?\n\nMusk has been highly critical of Agrawal since being chosen to succeed co-founder Jack Dorsey. In December, he shared a meme that compared Agrawal taking the reins from Dorsey and Josef Stalin’s censors removing Soviet secret police official Nikolai Yezhov from photographic records.\n\nAgrawal, who could receive $42 million if he is terminated from his position, was short in his remarks following the deal announcement.\n\nParag Agrawal poses for a picture in a file photo. (Ellian Raffoul/Twitter via AP)\n\n“Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,” he said. “Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.”\n\nRegarding the rest of the workforce, Elon Musk will need to determine a different structure for employee compensation since stock grants and rewards are not feasible. There is some speculation that staff members could be given equity in the next incarnation of Twitter, which would be beneficial if the tech firm goes public again.\n\nIn addition, should Musk dismantle many of the content-moderation policies, many employees might no longer be needed.\n\nThe next stage is determining how much control Musk will have over Twitter and whether he can navigate through the murky waters of social media, says Eric Dahan, CEO at Open Influence, a marketing company focused on social media platforms.\n\n“Even though Twitter has been around forever, Musk is bringing a lot of hype to it,” he told The Epoch Times. “The question is, can Elon innovate from a social standpoint and build features that are going to increase user engagement and usage in general on the platform?”\n\nWhat would some of these business strategies be with Musk at the helm?\n\nNew Twitter Possibilities\n\nDahan explained that social media platforms need to keep users regularly engaged and interact with one another. He notes that outlets that generate tremendous buzz and hype in the beginning can quickly fade without this tactic in place.\n\nIn a way, Twitter needs to emulate TikTok by making it more engaging and simple to use, argues Chris Tompkins, the CEO and founder of The Go! Agency, a digital marketing firm.\n\n“They need to get more people active. Twenty-five percent of Twitter users are responsible for 97 percent of the posts. For a platform that thrives on volume, it doesn’t look like engagement is that important,” he told The Epoch Times.\n\nTikTok, for example, has nailed it by making it fun and simple for people to join and stay engaged, he explained.\n\nThe number of people who start using Twitter could determine the next big step in the platform’s rebirth.\n\nSince Musk has become the new owner of Twitter, there has been an exceptional expectation of returning free speech to the platform, says Jeff Brain, the CEO of CloutHub, a platform that defines itself as a non-biased social network.\n\nBut what does this entail exactly?\n\n“It’s perhaps returning accounts that have been banned for reasons that they shouldn’t have been,” Brain told The Epoch Times. “The other thing is loosening the rules about what’s allowed and what’s not allowed and being consistent in those rules.”\n\nThat said, even if the billionaire entrepreneur fails to revitalize Twitter, Tompkins thinks some of Musk’s influence could potentially construct “a more engaged platform that people will want to engage with, not just scroll endlessly.”\n\nWhat Wall Street Says\n\nToday, Twitter still functions as a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors can purchase shares for about $50 and buy and sell until the deal is finalized and the stock is delisted.\n\nIn addition to what investors can or cannot do, what does Wall Street say about the Musk-Twitter saga?\n\n“We expect Musk to face some scrutiny in the media and from regulators regarding his plans to significantly ease content moderation on the platform,” wrote Ali Mogharabi, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, in a research note. While the deal is likely to go through, the market may be pricing in such a risk, as the stock is trading around 5 percent below the announced acquisition price.”\n\nIndeed, there could be a lot at stake, be it digital advertising or subscriptions.\n\nMusk has made it clear he wants to overhaul Twitter Blue by cutting the price, removing ads for subscribers, and allowing users to pay with Dogecoin.\n\nAfter years of stagnation and a lack of product innovation, some say it is unclear if conditions will improve or worsen under Musk. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney warned of a potential advertiser exodus, projecting that users might not be interested in easing content moderation and subscription offerings.\n\nTwitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey gestures while interacting with students at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi, India, on Nov. 12, 2018. (Prakash Singh/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“We’re skeptical that less moderation will lead to a material rise in user growth. And interest in a subscription offering has always been limited in our surveys, with only 13 percent of respondents in our latest survey expressing interest,” he stated.\n\n“That said, Musk’s ideas of allowing tweet edits and removing text character limits strike us as very sound and user-friendly.”\n\nDorsey welcomed the move, posting a series of tweet on April 25, saying that “Elon is the singular solution I trust.”\n\n“Twitter as a company has always been my sole issue and my biggest regret. It has been owned by Wall Street and the ad model. Taking it back from Wall Street is the correct first step,” the ex-CEO said, likely referring to the continuing pressure on public companies from Wall Street to maximize short-term earnings.\n\nMusk ostensibly believes Twitter has a lot of potential, notes MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson in a report.\n\n“We did not believe another bidder was out there and that Elon Musk’s offer was a steal of a deal for shareholders given the operating, monetization, and valuation challenges at the company,” he said. “Twitter’s sale for $54.20 is final evidence that the idea of Twitter has been far more valuable than the actual long-run operations of Twitter!”\n\nTwitter is scheduled to deliver its first-quarter 2022 results on Thursday. The tech giant forecasts total revenues between $1.17 billion and $1.27 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate suggests Twitter revenues will come in at $1.21 billion, representing a 17.01 percent gain from the same quarter a year ago.\n\nTwitter shares tumbled about 3 percent to around $50 on Thursday.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/26/Musk-Twitter-GettyImages-1393675185-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:45'}

Apparently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul also believes Ukraine isn’t a state, based on this head-scratching exchange with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.\n\nBLINKEN: If you look at the countries Russia attacked, these were countries that were not part of NATO More from Rolling Stone RAND PAUL: You could also argue the countries they've attacked were part of Russia BLINKEN: I firmly disagree. It's the right of these countries to decide their future pic.twitter.com/4ZeZOVrK0i — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 26, 2022\n\nPaul’s position is shocking but not entirely uncommon. Ukraine’s current security situation is the result of years of policy decisions made by Western countries, the Ukrainian government, and Russia, and Paul belongs to a camp that thinks the actions of NATO member states are more responsible for the current war than, say, Russia, the nation that started it. The core of this argument is that NATO’s courtship of Ukraine was the primary accelerant in the current crisis. There are points in this argument’s favor — NATO’s expansionist policies since the early ‘90s have not been exactly stabilizing to the region — but they often overlook the only question that should matter: What do Ukrainians want to do? Since 2014, they’ve overwhelmingly wanted to join NATO.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated video: Secretary of State Blinken says 'Ukrainians have won the battle for Kyiv'\n\nThe argument, unfortunately, is an easy gateway to what we see in the video, which is a tacit denial that Ukraine has the right to exist as a state. This is also one of the key justifications Russian President Vladimir Putin made when he first announced a “Special Military Operation” against Ukraine.\n\nThe exchange between Paul and Blinken perfectly sums up the opposing rhetorical sides of the conflict, which in practice has resulted in the destruction of cities and thousands of deaths. Blinken’s point is that Ukraine is an independent nation, and that if it were in NATO, Russia wouldn’t have attacked it. Paul’s point is that Ukraine — and other post-Soviet republics like Georgia and Moldova — share ties to Russia that make them part of the same state, essentially, and that bringing them into NATO would risk a confrontation between nuclear-armed powers. Paul says he opposes the invasion itself, of course, but his stance on self-determination makes this point basically moot.\n\nBoth points are in some ways correct — a conflict between NATO and Russia would be unbelievably disastrous — but in making this point, Paul denies the self-determination of a country of people who did not ask for war. It’s well worth criticizing NATO’s policies in the formation of the current crisis, but only one party in the conflict thus far has violated another nation’s sovereignty and killed its people en masse. The only way to rectify this is to support — preferably by peaceful and diplomatic means — the ability of the Ukrainian people to make decisions on a world stage with their own interests at heart, rather than the interests of a state staring at them down the barrel of a gun.\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nClick here to read the full article.", 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KW.kzReW_0fGo.6YzbJP3g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fEl.lg_bCH8nX2bGfrm51A--~B/aD0xMzEyO3c9MTgwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/rollingstone.com/9dfed2914fe95ea7d50489f09c18138d', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:04:23'}

Scott Perry (R-PA) went as far as to call for an investigation into whether Italian satellites stole votes from the former president.\n\nThe messages were given to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. They add another name into the mix of those who attempted to help delay the certification of the results.\n\nAccording to CNN, Perry texted Meadows numerous times following the election.\n\nOn Nov. 12, the congressman and U.S. Army veteran sent Meadows a message asking him to have the country\u2019s intelligence community look into international chatter about Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nPerry was apparently operating under the belief the company\u2019s election equipment was used to steal a win from Trump.\n\n\u201cFrom an Intel friend: [Director of National Intelligence] needs to task NSA to immediately seize and begin looking for international comms related to Dominion,\u201d Perry texted.\n\nThat same day, Perry texted Meadows a theory that unnamed British actors might have been behind election malfeasance.\n\nCNN reported,\n\nPerry wrote to Meadows again on November 12 claiming that \u201cthe Brits\u201d orchestrated a conspiracy to manipulate voting machines in the US and that then-CIA Director Gina Haspel was helping cover it up. \u201cAnd Gina is still running around on the Hill covering for the Brits who helped quarterback this entire operation,\u201d Perry texted. \u201cDNI needs to be tasked to audit their overseas accounts at CIA \u2013 and their National Endowment for Democracy.\u201d\n\nIn December 2020, Perry again reached out to Meadows, but received no response.\n\nHe reportedly sent Meadows a conspiracy theory video from YouTube that implied satellites based in Italy had changed votes from Trump to then-candidate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just work with the Italian government?\u201d Perry asked.\n\nThe messages also purport to show that Perry acted as an intermediary Meadows and individuals at the Department of Justice.\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",

        "text": "Hunter Biden\u2019s business partner, Eric Schwerin, visited the Obama White House 19 times, according to visitor logs reviewed by The New York Post:\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s closest business partner made at least 19 visits to the White House and other official locations between 2009 and 2015, including a sitdown with then-Vice President Joe Biden in the West Wing. Visitor logs from the White House of former President Barack Obama reviewed by The Post cast further doubt over Joe Biden\u2019s claims that he knew nothing of his son\u2019s dealings. Eric Schwerin met with Vice President Biden on November 17, 2010 in the West Wing, when he was the president of the since-dissolved investment fund Rosemont Seneca Partners. TRENDING: Swamp Rat Mitch McConnell Said He Was \"Exhilarated\" on Jan 6 that President Trump \"Had Finally Tarnished His Reputation\" The logs also reveal that Schwerin met with various close aides of both Joe and Jill Biden at key moments in Hunter\u2019s life when he was striking multi-million dollar deals in foreign countries, including China. Yet President Biden has long insisted he had no involvement in his son\u2019s foreign affairs. \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d he said in 2019.\n\nNow this\u2026\n\nEric Schwerin made 8 additional White House visits in 2016, according to visitor logs reviewed by Fox News.\n\nThat means Hunter Biden\u2019s closest business partner visited the White House at least 27 times while Joe Biden was Vice President.\n\nEric Schwerin also had a sit-down meeting with Joe Biden.\n\nFox News reported:\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s longtime business partner Eric Schwerin visited the White House at least eight times in 2016, meeting with then-Vice President Biden\u2019s chief of staff Steve Ricchetti, who currently serves as Biden\u2019s White House counselor, and an assistant in Biden\u2019s office who used to work at the investment firm Schwerin and Hunter managed. Those eight additional visits, in addition to 19 previously known Schwerin visits, bring his total number of White House visits during the Obama-Biden administration to 27. Schwerin, the president of since-dissolved investment fund Rosemont Seneca Partners, visited Ricchetti at least twice in 2016. The two visits occurred in room 272 on Feb. 29 and room 276 on Aug. 17 at the Old Executive Office Building (OEOB), according to the 2016 White House visitor logs. Ricchetti has been a longtime adviser to President Biden and served as his chief of staff from 2013 to 2017. He now serves as Biden\u2019s White House counselor. Schwerin also met with Anne Marie Person, who served as a general assistant at Rosemont until 2014 before joining Biden\u2019s office, at least three times between February and June 2016, a Fox News Digital review found. According to White House visitor logs, Schwerin met her in Biden\u2019s \u201cWest Wi[ng]\u201d office on Feb. 24, April 8, and June 9. It is unclear if Biden was present for the meetings.\n\nJoe Biden has repeatedly claimed he was never involved with Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings.\n\nThis of course is a brazen lie.\n\nThe Daily Mail obtained an email revealing Joe Biden paid for Hunter Biden\u2019s legal bill for a deal with Communist China.\n\nA newly released email from 2019 shows Hunter Biden\u2019s assistant Katie Dodge telling book-keeper Linda Shapero and Biden aide Richard Ruffner that Joe Biden agreed to pay Hunter\u2019s legal bills that amounted to more than $730,000.\n\nJoe Biden also had $5.2 million in unexplained income, according to documents reviewed by the Daily Mail.",

        "text": "Officials in Poland and Bulgaria say Russia is suspending their countries' natural gas deliveries starting on Wednesday.\n\nThe governments of the two European countries said Tuesday that Russian energy giant Gazprom informed them it was halting gas supplies.\n\nThe suspensions would be the first since Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that \"unfriendly\" foreign buyers would have to pay the state-owned Gazprom in rubles instead of other currencies.\n\nEurope imports large amounts of Russian natural gas to heat homes, generate electricity and fuel industry. The imports have continued despite the war in Ukraine.\n\nAround 60% of imports are paid in euros, and the rest in dollars. Putin's demand was apparently intended to help bolster the Russian currency amid the war in Ukraine.\n\nEuropean leaders said they would not comply, arguing the requirement for them to purchase rubles and then pay Gazprom violated the terms of contracts and their sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe \"Russian proposal for a two-step payment procedure is in violation with the current contract and bears considerable risks for Bulgaria, including to make payments without receiving any gas deliveries from Russia,\" the Bulgarian government said.\n\nBulgaria said it was working with state gas companies to find alternative sources to replace the supplies it gets from Russia via Bulgaria gets Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline.\n\nThe government said no restrictions on domestic gas consumption would be imposed for now even though the Balkan country of 6.5 million meets over 90% of its gas needs with Russian imports.\n\nPoland's state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop Wednesday.\n\nPoland not only has refused to pay for natural gas in rubles, but the country has been a strong supporter of neighboring Ukraine during the Russian invasion. It is a transit point for weapons the United States and other Western nations have provided Ukraine.\n\nThe Polish government confirmed this week that it was sending tanks to Ukraine's army. On Tuesday, it announced a sanctions list targeting 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom.\n\nThe Yamal pipeline carries natural gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, through Belarus. Poland has been receiving some 9 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually.\n\nPGNiG said that Russia's demand to be paid in rubles represented a breach of the Yamal contract.\n\nFlow charts published on the website of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas showed drastic drops of gas flows at entry points in Kondratki, a town in eastern Poland, and Vysokaye, which is in Belarus.\n\nThe Russian news agency Tass cited Gazprom as saying that Poland must pay for its gas supplies under a new procedure.\n\nPoland appeared to be the European customer to have its gas shipments halted by Russia.\n\nPolish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources. She said the country has been effectively independent when it comes to Russian gas for some time.\n\n\"There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes,\" Moskwa tweeted.\n\nThe minister repeated that message at a news conference, saying: \"Appropriate diversification strategies that we have introduced allow us to feel on the safe side in this situation,\" she said.\n\nPoland has been working since the 1990s to wean itself off of Russian energy and was already on track to end its reliance on Russian gas this year. It recently moved to stop imports of Russian coal.\n\nThe government in Warsaw has urged other European countries to lessen their dependence on Russian energy sources.",

        "text": "MARIUPOL, UKRAINE (JTA) \u2014 Barring a miracle, Mariupol, the beleaguered industrial center in eastern Ukraine, may henceforth be known only as the city that bore the brunt of Vladimir Putin\u2019s unprovoked assault on Ukraine\u2019s independence and its people.\n\nBut the city also has a rich and often tragic Jewish history, shaped by conflict and the efforts of previous generations to preserve their lives, faith and culture in the face of brutality.\n\nOne such story starts at the beginning of the 20th century, not in Ukraine but in Lithuania.\n\nPerched on the western edge of the Russian Empire, the Lithuanian town of Panevezys (pronounced Ponevezh or Ponevich) was home to some 7,000 Jews, roughly half the total population. The town boasted few amenities, but chief among them was the yeshiva established in 1909 by Liba Miriam Gavronskii, widowed daughter of the wealthy tea magnate Kalonymus Wissotsky. Rabbi Yitshak Yaakov Rabinovich (known as Reb Itsele Ponevezher, 1854-1919) was its first head, or rosh yeshiva.\n\nThe yeshiva flourished, but it faced an early threat to its existence with the outbreak of World War I. Seeking to undermine the Russian war effort, the Germans directed a Yiddish-language proclamation to the Jews of the Russian Empire, promising them full emancipation and equal rights once the Romanov dynasty was toppled. Already distrustful of his large Jewish population, the notoriously antisemitic Tsar Nicholas II ordered a brutal expulsion of Jews from the borderlands region to the interior of the Russian Empire.\n\nThe Yeshiva of Ponevezh was forced to relocate, first to Ludza in nearby Latvia, and then once again to Mariupol. Before returning to reestablish itself in independent Lithuania in 1919, the yeshiva would spend the remainder of the war years in Mariupol.\n\nWhy Mariupol? The great distance from the front lines certainly factored in the thinking of the rosh yeshiva, but Mariupol had developed a reputation as a haven for Jewish settlement. In 1791, the port city was added to the Pale of Settlement, the region of the Russian Empire designated for Jews. By 1847 just over a hundred Jews had established homes in Mariupol, participating in the Black Sea trade. It became a destination for Jews looking for economic opportunity and those fleeing the overcrowded regions of Lithuania and Belarus. By the end of the 19th century, the city was home to over 5,000 Jews, constituting 16% of the population; the 1926 census records 7,332 Jews in Mariupol, or 18% of the city.\n\nThe expanding, dynamic Jewish community of Mariupol \u2014 disturbed only by riots associated with the 1905 revolution \u2014 came to an abrupt end with the Nazi invasion. Mariupol\u2019s Jews were rounded up and shot by Einsatzgruppen on a single dark day \u2014 Oct. 18, 1941 \u2014 as part of the horrific \u201cHolocaust by Bullets.\u201d\n\nRabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, second rosh yeshiva of the Ponevezh Yeshiva. (National Library of Israel)\n\nAs for the Lithuanian yeshiva that was sheltered by Mariupol in World War I, it went on to establish itself as one of the greatest institutions of Talmudic study during the interwar years. In 1939, however, war came to Panevezys again, with both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany invading Lithuania. Under the leadership of Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman (1888-1969), the yeshiva continued to function under Communist rule despite the fact that he was trapped outside the country, with students moving from one synagogue to another until the Nazis took over in June 1941 and murdered them all, together with most of Rabbi Kahaneman\u2019s family.\n\nIn 1944, Rabbi Kahaneman reestablished the Ponevezh Yeshiva once again \u2014 this time in B\u2019nai Brak, in what would become Israel \u2014 with seven students. Amazingly, it has grown to reclaim its reputation among the most prominent institutions of higher Talmudic education in the world; at 98, its current rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, is regarded by many as the spiritual leader of the \u201cLithuanian\u201d non-Hasidic stream of haredi Orthodoxy.\n\nAfter the Holocaust, Jews slowly trickled back into Mariupol, which in 1948 was renamed Zhdanov by the Soviets after the sudden death of Andrei Zhdanov (1896-1948), long rumored to be Joseph Stalin\u2019s presumed successor (his son also married the Soviet dictator\u2019s daughter). By 1959 over 2,000 Jews lived in the city, but only constituted about 1% of the total population.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union, the city reclaimed its original name of Mariupol in 1989, and became part of newly independent Ukraine shortly thereafter. The heroic presence of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement in Mariupol, as in many formerly Soviet communities, supported the tiny Jewish population that remained after most of them emigrated to Israel in Operation Exodus \u2014 when Jews escaped the crumbling Soviet Union more than three decades ago \u2014 and continued to serve even through the Russian invasions of 2014 and 2018. Now, in the midst of the invasion of 2022, Chabad and others are working to evacuate as many of them as possible.",

        "text": "This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo \u2013 to whom quoted text may be attributed \u2013 at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.\n\nIn response to the growing Ukrainian refugee crisis, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and humanitarian partners are appealing for increased financial support to help refugees and the neighbouring countries generously hosting them.\n\nLaunching an updated Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRRP) for the Ukraine situation yesterday, UNHCR and partners are seeking US$1.85 billion to support a projected 8.3 million refugees in neighbouring countries, namely Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, as well as other countries in the region, including Belarus, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.\n\nIt is launched against the backdrop of continued fighting, destruction and displacement inside Ukraine. So far, the war has uprooted more than 12.7 million people in the past two months alone \u2013 of whom more than 5 million have fled as refugees across the borders and 7.7 million remain displaced inside the country. Almost 13 million more people are also estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to security risks.\n\nThe human impact and the suffering already caused by this war are staggering. Families have been torn apart, houses and infrastructure have been destroyed, while the trauma of war will have a lasting impact on many of those forced to flee their homes, including women and children who represent some 90 per cent of those forced to flee.\n\nSince the onset of the war, countries in the region have continued to keep their borders open and to welcome refugees. The mobilization of national authorities, host communities, grassroots organizations and tens of thousands of volunteers across neighbouring countries and beyond has been remarkable and shows what can be achieved with a \u201cwhole-of-society\u201d approach, and in the spirit of the Global Compact on Refugees.\n\nUnder the leadership of various host country governments, the RRP brings together 142 organizations including UN agencies, the IFRC and national Red Cross societies, national and international NGOs, faith-based institutions, civil society and academia.\n\nIt focuses on key sectors including protection, food security, health and nutrition, education, basic needs, water, sanitation and hygiene, livelihoods and resilience, energy and environment and logistics. Transitional cash assistance, which has already benefited tens of thousands of refugees in neighbouring countries, is a key priority in providing dignified assistance to refugees.\n\nThis plan aims to ensure that all refugees fleeing Ukraine have access to safety and international protection. It aims to ensure timely and life-saving humanitarian assistance to refugees fleeing Ukraine and third-country nationals, of whom a sizeable number would need international protection. The plan also focuses on solutions through the promotion of social and economic opportunities.\n\nNeighbouring host countries have existing mechanisms and capacities to respond. However, the scale of refugee arrivals and the breadth of their needs requires further support for national social protection systems and services.\n\nNational authorities and regional institutions have moved quickly to ensure temporary protection throughout Europe and beyond in the spirit of solidarity and responsibility sharing. Robust and flexible funding will be crucial to sustaining this solidarity and reaffirming support for the continued protection and inclusion of refugees.\n\nUntil we see an end to this war, humanitarian needs will continue to grow and displacement will not cease.\n\nFor more information on this topic, please contact:\n\nIn Geneva: Shabia Mantoo, mantoo@unhcr.org +41 79 337 76 50\n\nIn Warsaw: Rafa\u0142 Kostrzynski, kostrzy@unhcr.org +48 788 224 010\n\nIn Budapest: Zoran Stevanovic, stevanoz@unhcr.org +36 305 309 633\n\nIn Chisinau: Moldova: Kisut Gebreegziabher, gegziabk@unhcr.org +37 367 722 468\n\nIn Bucharest: Gabriela Leu, leu@unhcr.org +40 722 212 097",

The White House has not confirmed any visit. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\nZelenskyy earlier said he was \"expecting specific things and specific weapons\" from world leaders who come to the country. He said he would ask Blinken and Austin for more powerful weapons during their talks.\n\nNo humanitarian routes out of Mariupol on Sunday\n\nIryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister, said that no humanitarian routes were established to bring civilians and the wounded out of Mariupol on Sunday.\n\nVereshchuk blamed Russian forces for continuing their siege on the southern port city that has faced weeks of bombardment.\n\nThe Ukrainian side would try again on Monday, Vereshchuk said.

Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine also called for a truce as both Russia and Ukraine mark Orthodox Easter this Sunday.\n\nMoscow blocks leading chess site\n\nChess.com, one of the most popular chess websites in the world, is now inaccessible in Russia. According to the Interfax news agency, the country's media supervisor Roskomnadzor has blocked two of its pages with information about the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian prosecutors demanded the move on Saturday. As the site uses https network protocol, barring the access to those pages has reportedly caused the entire site to be inaccessible in Russia.\n\nPreviously, Russian grandmaster Sergei Karjakin had called for the pages with information about what Russia calls its \"special military operations\" in Ukraine to be blocked.\n\nRussia claims it struck arms depots in the Kharkiv region\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense said Sunday that it had struck nine Ukrainian military targets overnight.\n\nIncluded among those targets were four arms depots in the Kharkiv region where artillery is stored and a facility producing military grade explosives in Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nWatch video 02:39 A village in Ukraine marks Good Friday in wartime\n\nUkrainian negotiator calls for a 'real Easter truce'\n\nMykhailo Podoliak, the senior Ukrainian negotiator and presidential advisor, urged a \"real Easter truce\" as both Ukraine and Russia mark Orthodox Easter.\n\nOn Twitter, Podoliak also urged a humanitarian corridor out of the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\n\"Russia is continuously attacking the Mariupol Azovstal.

The Kremlin has argued that because of this, Ukraine's national identity is virtually identical to Russia's; Kyiv strongly objects.\n\nMeanwhile, Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world's Eastern Orthodox Christians, called from Istanbul for humanitarian corridors to be opened in Ukraine where he said \"an indescribable human tragedy is unfolding.\"\n\n\"We call once again for an immediate end to the fratricidal war, which, like any war, undermines human dignity,\" Bartholomew added.\n\nSwitzerland impedes German arms deliveries: report\n\nSwitzerland has blocked the re-export from Germany to Ukraine of Swiss-produced ammunition used in German-made Marder infantry fighting vehicles, according to the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.\n\nThe move by Switzerland, which maintains a neutral status, has held up arms deliveries by Germany at a time when Berlin is already under fire for failing to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons to help fight off Russia's invasion of the country.\n\nSwitzerland has gone against previous practice and adopted EU sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for its invasion, but has insisted its neutrality does not allow it to send arms to conflict zones. Swiss officials have previously rejected Poland's request for the Alpine state to send arms to Ukraine.\n\nThe Marder vehicles are made by German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall but use Swiss-manufactured ammunition.\n\nUK says Russian troops suffer from poor morale\n\nRussia has made \"some territorial gains\" since starting the ongoing offensive in the east of the country, according to UK military intelligence. At the same time, UK officials said that Ukraine provided strong resistance and inflicted significant losses on the Russian forces.\n\n\"Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,\" they said on Twitter.\n\nUkraine governor says Russian attacks killed 8 in Luhansk\n\nRussian shelling killed eight people and injured two more in Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, according to governor Serhiy Gaidai.

When this war is over, we must carefully analyze how this happened,\" he told newspaper Bild am Sonntag.\n\nHe did not spare his own party, saying \"serious failures\" were made on defense over the past two decades.\n\n\"Looking back, we must, unfortunately, say that all defense ministers of the past 20 years made wrong decisions about materiel and the condition of troops,\" Merz said.\n\nWatch video 04:21 Are Ukrainian forces getting everything they need?\n\nFrom the end of 2005 to the end of 2021, the CDU and its sister party, the CSU, held the Ministry of Defense.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a plan to beef up the German military in February, pledging a special package of \u20ac100 billion ($112.7 billion) to boost the strength of the country's armed forces.\n\nHe also vowed to increase Germany\u2019s annual defense spending to 2% of the nation\u2019s GDP, in line with NATO demands.\n\nUN Chief to stop in Turkey before visits to Russia and Ukraine\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will visit Turkey on Monday before heading to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and then to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the UN said in a statement.\n\nIn the Turkish capital Ankara, Guterres will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nTurkey has been trying to negotiate an end to the conflict, so far without success.\n\nOn Tuesday, Guterres will meet Putin in Moscow, followed by a trip Thursday to Kyiv in an effort to mediate an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy criticized Guterres's decision to head to Moscow before Kyiv, saying there is \"no justice and no logic in this order.\"\n\n\"The war is in Ukraine, there are no bodies in the streets of Moscow.

More info\n\nThe war hero was one of the first British soldiers to storm Gold Beach during the Normandy landings in 1944. Mr Billinge\u2019s coffin was taken through his hometown of St Austell in Cornwall before a church service in Charlestown, where hundreds turned out to pay their respects.\n\nMr Billinge was 96 when he died on 5 April after a brief illness. The former Royal Engineer was just 18 years old when he landed on the beach in Normandy in 1944. He was one of only four from his unit to survive. He later fought in Caen and the Falaise pocket in Normandy. Mr Billinge went on to raise tens of thousands of pounds for military charities in his late life. One of his daughters, Margot Billinge said on behalf of the family: \u201cHarry was a very loving husband who always looked after mum. \u201cHe was steadfast in his love for her. \u201cAs a dad, he taught us great values: honesty, kindness, generosity and not to judge.\u201d\n\nWar veteran Harry Billinge died earlier this month at 96 years old.\n\nMr Billinge\u2019s coffin was taken through his hometown of St Austell in Cornwall.\n\nMs Billinge added: \u201cHarry wanted future generations to never forget his comrades who fell in Normandy. \u201cIf members of the public would like to pay their respects to Harry, we ask that they become guardians of the British Normandy Memorial.\u201d The army veteran spent over 60 years collecting for the Royal British Legion\u2019s Poppy Appeal. He also helped raise more than \u00a350,000 for the British Normandy Memorial and would make annual journeys to cemeteries of northern France. Mr Billinge was appointed an MBE in 2020 for his fundraising work. He dedicated the honour to the 22,442 service personnel killed on D-Day and during the Battle for Normandy. Speaking to the BBC in 2019, Mr Billinge said: \u201cI'm no hero, I was lucky, I'm here. All the heroes are dead and I'll never forget them.\u201d READ MORE: Dan Walker pays touching tribute to D-Day veteran Harry Billinge\n\nMilitary veterans carried Mr Billinge's coffin to the church in Charlestown.\n\nMr Billinge received an MBE in 2020 for his fundraising work.\n\nMourners lined the streets of St Austell on Tuesday as the funeral procession travelled through the town and past the war memorial at Holy Trinity Church. It then travelled to Charlestown, where a guard of honour lined the streets. Family, friends and fellow veterans turned out to remember Mr Billinge. A guard of honour lined the streets outside the church and standard bearers also attended the service. St Paul\u2019s Church in Charlestown was full to capacity while the nearby church hall was also set up for 150 people to watch the service via video link. Revd Canon Bowers said: \u201cHe arranged this service only a few months ago when, I think, he realised his health was failing. \u201cHe faced death with the same bravery he showed on the Normandy beaches.\u201d\n\nMr Billinge's coffin was carried into St Paul's Church in Charlestown.\n\nTrending",

Police used tear gas to disperse gatherings in Paris and the western city of Rennes.\n\n- New era -\n\nIn a victory speech on the Champ de Mars in central Paris at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, Macron vowed to respond to the anger of voters who backed his far-right rival, saying his new term would not continue unchanged from the last five years.\n\n\"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right,\" he told thousands of cheering supporters.\n\n\"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me.\"\n\nHe also pledged a \"renewed method\" to govern France, adding that this \"new era\" would not be one of \"continuity with the last term which is now ending\".\n\nIn a combative speech to supporters in Paris in which she accepted the result but showed no sign of quitting politics, Le Pen, 53, said she would \"never abandon\" the French and was already preparing for the June legislative elections.\n\n\"The result represents a brilliant victory,\" she said to cheers.\n\n\"This evening, we launched the great battle for the legislative elections,\" Le Pen said, adding that she felt \"hope\" and calling on opponents of the president to join with her National Rally (RN) party.\n\n- 'Count on France' -\n\nThe result is narrower than the second-round clash in 2017, when the same two candidates met in the run-off and Macron polled over 66 percent of the vote.\n\nFor Le Pen, her third defeat in presidential polls will be a bitter pill to swallow after she plowed years of effort into making herself electable and distancing her party from the legacy of its founder, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nCritics insisted her party never stopped being extreme-right and racist while Macron repeatedly pointed to her plan to ban the wearing of the Muslim headscarf in public if elected.\n\nThe projections caused immense relief in Europe after fears a Le Pen presidency would leave the continent rudderless following Brexit and the departure from politics of German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron's victory \"great news for all of Europe\" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters \"sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today\".\n\nEU president Charles Michel said the bloc could now \"count on France for five more years\" while Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also congratulated him, saying she was \"delighted to be able to continue our excellent cooperation\".\n\nIn another election Sunday, Slovenia's three-time Prime Minister Janez Jansa, criticized by opponents as an authoritarian right-wing populist, was at risk of losing power to a party led by political newcomer Robert Golob.\n\n- 'Ocean of abstention' -\n\nMacron will be hoping for a less complicated second term that will allow him to implement his vision of more pro-business reform and tighter EU integration, after a first term shadowed by protests, then the pandemic and finally Russia's military operation in Ukraine.\n\nBut he will have to win over those who backed his opponents and the millions of French who did not bother to vote.\n\nPolling organizations estimated turnout of just 72 percent, the lowest in any presidential election second-round run-off since 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, according to partial results, 6.45 percent of voters in the election voted for neither candidate in blank ballots while 2.35 percent spoilt their papers.\n\nThe hard-left third-placed candidate in the first round, Jean-Luc Melenchon, had refused to endorse Macron.\n\nHe has his eyes firmly set on the June elections.\n\nMelenchon welcomed Le Pen's defeat as \"very good news for the unity of our people\" but said Le Pen and Macron had barely managed to win a third of support from registered voters.\n\nMacron \"is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots\", he said.",

They want to force the Ukrainians to fight with Russia to the last soldier with these arms deliveries, if only this conflict dragged on longer, so that Russia, they hope, would suffer more and more from it\u201d, he said.\n\nRussia had lost its \u201clast hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter after Lavrov\u2019s interview. \u201cThis only means Moscow senses defeat.\u201d\n\nDuring a visit to Kyiv on Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised more military aid for Ukraine.\n\nUkraine calls for heavy arms as top US officials make Easter visit US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Kyiv late on Sunday (24 April) and held talks President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, an aide to the Ukrainian leader said, as Russia\u2019s invasion entered a third month.\n\nThe US State Department on Monday used an emergency declaration to approve the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine. The Pentagon said the package could include artillery ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.\n\nMoscow\u2019s ambassador to Washington told the United States to halt shipments, warning Western weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nLavrov said: \u201cNATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. A la guerre comme \u00e0 la guerre.\u201d\n\nIn another interview on 19 April Lavrov said that Russia would not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. However, experts have warned that a Russian attack with tactical nuclear weapons could be aimed at a target outside Ukraine.\n\nLavrov says Russia will not hit Ukraine with nukes Russia will use only conventional weapons in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in response to a question about the possible use of nuclear arms in the war.\n\nRussia\u2019s two-month-old invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced over 5 million people to flee abroad.\n\nMoscow calls its actions a \u201cspecial operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West says this a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe United States is due to host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries this week for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv, US officials said.\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defence talks at Germany's Ramstein air base US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin will host Ukraine-focused defence talks with allies at Ramstein Air Base in Germany next week, the Pentagon said on Thursday (21 April).\n\nBritain said all tariffs on goods coming into the country from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed and it would send new ambulances, fire engines, medical supplies and funding for health experts to help the emergency services.\n\nRussia has yet to capture any of the biggest cities. Its forces were forced to pull back from the outskirts of Kyiv in the face of stiff resistance.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that every day \u2013 and especially today, when the third month of our resistance has begun \u2013 that everyone in Ukraine is concerned with peace, about when it will all be over,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere is no simple answer to that at this time.\u201d\n\nHaving failed to take the capital Kyiv, Moscow last week launched a massive assault in an attempt to capture eastern provinces known as the Donbas, which if successful would link territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to deliver foreign weapons to Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbas region. Reuters could not verify the report.\n\nThe head of Ukraine\u2019s state rail company said that one railway worker had been killed and four injured by Russian missile strikes on five Ukrainian railway stations on Monday.\n\nUkrainian forces have repelled five Russian attacks and killed just over 200 Russian servicemen, said the Ukrainian military command in the southern and eastern sectors.\n\nFive tanks were also destroyed, along with eight armoured vehicles, it said in a statement\n\nReuters was not able to immediately verify the reports.\n\nRussian forces were continuing on Monday to bomb and shell the vast Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol where fighters are hunkered down in a city ravaged by a siege and bombardment, Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said.\n\nMoscow said it was opening a humanitarian corridor to let civilians out of the plant but Kyiv said no agreement had been reached.\n\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who has been seeking a humanitarian truce in Ukraine, is due to meet Putin in Moscow on Tuesday and Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Thursday.\n\n(Edited by Georgi Gotev)",

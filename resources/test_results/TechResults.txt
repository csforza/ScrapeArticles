Will banned users return?\n\nMusk has laid out a more relaxed vision for content moderation that would lean toward temporary “timeouts” over permanent bans.\n\nAdvocacy groups are concerned that this switch could reverse Twitter’s permanent bans on public figures and politicians — including former President Trump.\n\n2. Leadership changes: While Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n3. How could the product change?: Major changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n4. Washington’s ire: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech.”\n\n5. How will Twitter’s workers respond?: Twitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCOVID ABSENCES FURTHER DELAY FTC VOTE\n\nThe vote on Alvaro Bedoya’s nomination to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to be further delayed due to COVID-19 linked absences in the Senate, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide.\n\nSens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Vice President Harris all tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans have broadly pushed back on Bedoya’s nomination to the FTC, leaving Democrats in need of all senators and Harris present to secure his confirmation.\n\nThe Senate aide said absent to an objection by Republicans, the Senate is expected to delay the consideration of Bedoya to a later date.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee advanced Bedoya in a vote along party lines in March, after delays based on Sen. Ben Ray Luján’s (D-N.M.) absence while he recovered from a stroke.\n\nAs he awaits confirmation, the FTC remains split along party lines, thwarting Democrats from pushing forward with their full agenda.\n\nEU WARNS MUSK\n\nThierry Breton, the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market, tweeted Tuesday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who just secured a deal to buy Twitter, will have to comply with the commission’s rules on moderation.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules — regardless of their shareholding,” Breton tweeted. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\n“He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nBITS AND PIECES\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Elon Musk’s Twitter purchase brings free speech into sharp focus\n\nLighter click: happy carrot time\n\nNotable links from around the web:\n\nWhat Elon Musk’s battles with Washington might mean for Twitter (Politico / Emily Birnbaum)\n\nHow to Become a MAGA Rap Kingpin (Without Believing What You’re Saying) (Rolling Stone / Alice Hines)\n\nFacebook Doesn’t Know What It Does With Your Data, Or Where It Goes: Leaked Document (Motherboard / Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai)\n\nOne last thing: Truth Social struggles\n\nShares that are tied with the company funding former President Trump’s latest social media venture, Truth Social, took a dive on Monday after social media platform Twitter announced its deal with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nCNBC reported that Digital World Acquisition Corp.’s shares fell to nearly 13 percent on Monday, bringing the company’s year-to-date losses to more than 30 percent.\n\nTruth Social, which officially launched in February, was created by Trump after he was permanently banned from multiple social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram for actions involving the Jan.6 insurrection at the Capitol, CNBC noted.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

Subsequent events put that moniker to the test, as repressive regimes cracked down on Twitter users, particularly in the wake of the short-lived “Arab Spring” demonstrations. In the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums.\n\nOver the subsequent years, Twitter learned a few things about the consequences of running a largely unmoderated social platform — one of the most important being that companies generally don't want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement, and misinformation that aims to tip elections or undermine public health.\n\n“With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself,” said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. “If you stop moderating with automated systems and human reviews, a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool.”\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the “health” of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the “report abuse” button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy’s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invested in staff and technology that detect violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violates its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used their platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies also stepped up their efforts against political misinformation.\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk, who describes himself as a “free-speech absolutist,” wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nEven now, Americans say they’re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a “fair or poor” job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.\n\nMeanwhile, terms like “censorship” and “free speech” have turned into political rallying cries for conservatives, frustrated by seeing right-leaning commentators and high-profile Republican officials booted off Facebook and Twitter for violating their rules.\n\nMusk appeared to criticize Twitter’s permanent ban of President Donald Trump last year for messages that the tech company said helped incite the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last year.\n\n“A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech,” Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nTrump’s allies, including his son Donald Trump Jr., have even pleaded for Musk to buy out the company.\n\n“If Elon Musk can privately send people into space I’m sure he can design a social network that isn’t biased,” Trump Jr. said in the caption of a video posted to Instagram last April.\n\nKirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame, said Twitter has consistently worked at being a “responsible” social media company through its moderation system, its hires in the area of machine learning ethics and in whom they allow to do research on the platform. The fact that Musk wants to change that, she added, suggests that he's focused on “irresponsible social media.”\n\nTwitter declined to comment for this story. A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to a message for comment.\n\nNew social media apps targeted at conservatives, including Trump’s Truth Social, haven't come remotely close to matching the success of Facebook or Twitter. That's partly because Republican politicians, politicians and causes already draw large audiences on existing, and much better established, platforms.\n\nIt's also partly due to floods of inflammatory, false or violent posts. Last year, for example, right-wing social media site Parler was nearly wiped off the internet when it became evident that rioters had used the app to promote violent messages and organize the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol. Apple and Google barred its app from their online stores, while Amazon stopped providing web-hosting services for the site.\n\nMusk himself regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and sometimes bullies reporters who have written critical articles about him or Tesla. He regularly tweets at reporters who write about his company, sometimes mischaracterizing their work as “false” or “misleading.”\n\nHis popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of the reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\n“I only block people as a direct insult,” Musk tweeted in 2020, responding to a tweet from a reporter.\n\nEvan Greer, a political activist with Fight for the Future, said Musk’s lack of experience in moderating an influential social media platform will be a problem if he successfully takes over the company.\n\n“If we want to protect free speech online, then we can’t live in a world where the richest person on Earth can just purchase a platform that millions of people depend on and then change the rules to his liking,” Greer said.", 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:30'}

The race to the bottom begins,” Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning Media Matters for America, said in a statement.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), using her official account, suggested that after Musk “seals the deal” she will get access to her personal account “restored” after it was banned in January for repeated violations of Twitter’s COVID-19 misinformation policy.\n\nTrump said Monday he would not return to Twitter but would remain on his own platform, Truth Social. However, some of Trump’s advisers told The Washington Post they don’t think he would turn down an offer to return to the platform that brought him so much attention during his campaign and term.\n\nMedia Matters compiled a list of banned Twitter users, including Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander and prominent QAnon figures celebrating Musk’s takeover, that critics believe could pose a threat if allowed back on the platform.\n\n“These folks are organized,” said Jessica González, co-CEO of Free Press and co-founder of Change the Terms.\n\n“I’m really talking about sophisticated, coordinated … efforts to use these platforms to radicalize people, to raise funds, to normalize violence and to issue calls to action for violent and threatening activity that happens in real life,” she added.\n\nLeadership changes\n\nWhile Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n“I think we feel very comfortable that [the deal] gives this team the ability to continue to make the company successful in between signing and closing the transaction,” Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter’s board of directors, reportedly said during a company-wide town hall Monday evening.\n\nOnce the deal is closed however, a shakeup at the top of the company seems likely.\n\nMusk’s relationship with current leadership has not been publicly confrontational. But Musk did reject their offer to join the board, an indication that he might be interested in pursuing his own vision of the platform.\n\nAgrawal will be in line for a $38.7 million pay package if the deal goes through and Musk chooses to terminate him.\n\nIt would be difficult for Musk to head the company alone given his active leadership or involvement in Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink.\n\nWhom Musk chooses to head Twitter if he refreshes current leadership could be the clearest signal of his plans for the platform.\n\n“Once the deal closes, we don’t know which direction the platform will go,” Agrawal reportedly admitted during Monday’s town hall.\n\nHow could the product change?\n\nMajor changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n“I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,” he said in a statement on the deal’s announcement.\n\nMusk has said that algorithms that make recommendations to users on what accounts to follow, posts to view or topics to read up on should be opened to public viewing.\n\nSuch a move could assuage concerns about political bias on the platform and give researchers much-needed access to social media’s levers.\n\nBut Twitter has already been very open about the effect of its algorithms. The company released a study in the fall finding that they tend to amplify right-leaning politicians more than their counterparts.\n\nFully publishing complex algorithms could not only lead to confusion, but open the platform up to cybersecurity risks.\n\nMusk has been very vocal about his desire to cut down on spam on Twitter but has given few specifics about how he would do.\n\nMusk’s proposal to authenticate all humans on Twitter has also prompted worry from civil society groups.\n\nSimple checks like CAPTCHAs before posting would likely be gameable with spam bots, while more stringent checks like ID verification would destroy the pseudonymity that Twitter has worked hard to maintain.\n\nEven if users are not required to post their real names on the platform, that data will have to be collected by Twitter and, therefore, could be compelled by governments to turn it over.\n\nThe impacts on free speech and the right to protest, especially in authoritarian states that already have rules against government criticism on social media, could be devastating.\n\n“There are no easy ways to require verification without wreaking havoc for some users, and for free speech,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in statement.\n\nWashington’s ire\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech overlords.”\n\n“Elon Musk is helping us defeat the Big Tech overlords. Our digital public squares need to be returned to us,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) tweeted.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) echoed Musk’s own words, saying the platform’s “full potential” will be unlocked if Musk can change the platform to “actually protect free speech and encourage open discourse.”\n\nThe GOP support builds on years of attacks on Twitter over claims of the platform censoring content with an anti-conservative bias.\n\nBut Democrats say Musk’s ownership raises additional concerns about the spread of disinformation.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told The Hill.\n\nSome progressives are using Musk’s takeover to push for a wealth tax and elevate concerns about power consolidation.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted.\n\nHow will Twitter’s workers respond?\n\nTwitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\n“Can someone just tell me if I’m rich or fired please,” one said.\n\n“The news today is so crazy I literally forgot I have COVID,” posted another.\n\nThe majority of the company’s 5,000-plus employees work in liberal San Francisco and, until now, have worked for a platform known for its aggressive approach to content moderation.\n\nThe company has led social media competitors in reacting to Trump’s dissemination of election disinformation and the spread of misinformation about COVID-19.\n\nMusk’s version of free speech appears to run counter to that approach, setting up potential ideological clashes.\n\nThe company reportedly took a precautionary measure Monday by temporarily freezing changes to the platform until next week. The move comes after one employee briefly took down Trump’s account several years ago.\n\nMusk also has a less than stellar reputation for the treatment of his employees.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing is in the midst of a lawsuit against Tesla over allegations of racism and harassment toward Black employees at a plant in Fremont, Calif.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board also found Tesla allegedly unlawfully interrogated and threatened workers over suspected union campaigns.\n\nThe loss of one of the key financial benefits of working for Twitter — stock — is unlikely to help matters.\n\n“Elon aside, can anyone explain to me how Twitter will hire/keep employees since there isn’t company stock to create competitive comp packages?

Wall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers.\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9% stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. rose more than 5% Monday to $51.70 per share. On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share. While the stock is up sharply since Musk made his offer, it is well below the high of $77 per share it reached in February 2021.\n\nMusk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has proposed relaxing Twitter content restrictions — such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump’s account — while ridding the platform of fake “spambot” accounts and shifting away advertising as its primary revenue model. Musk believes he can increase revenue through subscriptions that give paying customers a better experience — possibly even an ad-free version of Twitter.\n\nAsked during a recent TED interview if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he’d be “very reluctant” to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company’s rules.\n\nIt won’t be perfect, Musk added, “but I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible.”\n\nAfter the deal was announced, the NAACP released a statement urging Musk not to allow Trump, the 45th president, back onto the platform.\n\n“Do not allow 45 to return to the platform,” the civil rights organization said in a statement. “Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy.”\n\nAs both candidate and president, Trump made Twitter a powerful megaphone for speaking directly to the public, often using incendiary and divisive language on hot-button issues. He was permanently banned from the service in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisers, currently Twitter’s main customers, have also pushed for the stronger content rules Musk has criticized. Keeping them happy requires moderation limiting hate speech so that brands aren’t trying to promote their products next to “calls for genocide,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.\n\n“If Musk either fires or drives away the team at Twitter that’s committed to keeping it clean and making it less hate-filled, he’ll see an immediate drop in user activity,” said Vaidhyanathan. “I think he’s going to find pretty fast that inviting the bigots back in is bad for business.”\n\nSome users said Monday that they were planning to quit the platform if Musk took it over. To which he responded on Twitter: “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nMusk has also run into trouble with federal officials as a result of his own tweets, some of which he’s used to taunt regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting. More recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition.\n\nWhile Twitter’s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as Facebook and TikTok, the service is popular with celebrities, world leaders, journalists and intellectuals. Musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts.\n\nLast week, he said in SEC documents that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in Tesla, the electric-vehicle company he runs.\n\nMusk has a fortune of nearly $268 billion, much of which is tied up in Tesla stock and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It’s unclear how much cash Musk holds.\n\nMusk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, to Compaq for $307 million. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly. It was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nThat same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting NASA’s interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets.\n\nIn 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to astronomical success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles.\n\nMusk’s pledge to make Twitter a haven for free speech could dim the appeal of Donald Trump’s troubled Truth Social app, which the former president has touted as a competitor to Twitter that would cater to conservatives. Truth Social is part of Trump’s new media company, which has agreed to be taken public by Digital World Acquisition Corp. Shares of DWAC dropped 16.2% Monday and are down 46% since Musk revealed his stake in Twitter.\n\n__\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit. O’Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

For others who worry that Musk will give free rein to agitators who spew hate, lies and other harmful content, making the platform too toxic for advertisers and average users, Musk has offered few assurances.\n\n“The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all,” he tweeted Tuesday\n\nMany of Musk’s proposed changes reflect his own experience as a high-profile and outspoken Twitter user with more than 85 million followers and a swarm of pesky impersonator accounts that use his name and photo to promote cryptocurrency schemes. The statement announcing his acquisition of Twitter on Monday highlighted the need to defeat “spam bots” that mimic real users.\n\nBut what about Twitter’s more than 200 million other users who aren’t getting banned or flooded with spam? There’s still a lot of uncertainty about whether his ideas are technologically feasible and whether these changes would benefit most regular users, or serve some other purpose.\n\n“He’s made it pretty clear he’s not interested in making Twitter a profitable enterprise," said Joan Donovan, who studies misinformation at Harvard University. “It’s about the power and the influence of Twitter itself and its importance in our culture."\n\nExperts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter for years have expressed doubt that Musk knows exactly what he is getting into. And some of the problems he has identified aren\'t felt by most users.\n\n“The spam bots, for him, are highly visible and somewhat personal,” said Donovan. “Most people don’t see a lot of these spammy accounts.”\n\nAnd for those unhappy with the company\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation, there are plenty of fledgling examples of “free speech”-focused social media platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter antidotes, largely by conservatives. Many have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n“This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power,” said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. “I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter’s values.”\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk’s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n“This platform is pretty much the same one we’ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You’ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they’ve had trouble. It’s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway.”\n\nBut others familiar with Twitter say they\'re dismayed at Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n“Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform,” said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n“I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting,” Miley said. “He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter.”\n\nThe more hands-off approach to content moderation that Musk envisions has many users concerned that the platform will reanimate accounts that propagated dangerous conspiracies and harassment.\n\nWall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers — Twitter\'s chief revenue source. And it could make it harder to retain the San Francisco-based company\'s more than 7,500 employees, some of whom are already voicing concerns about the possibility of a backslide on content standards.\n\nIn Europe, officials reminded Musk about a new law, the Digital Services Act, that will force tech companies to step up policing of their online platforms.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules – regardless of their shareholding,” tweeted Thierry Breton, the European Union commissioner in charge of the bloc’s internal market. “Mr. Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMusk’s takeover is not yet a done deal and still awaits the approval of a majority of Twitter\'s stockholders. Twitter previously scheduled its annual shareholders meeting for May 25, but a regulatory filing Tuesday said the company will be convening a special meeting “as promptly as reasonably practicable."\n\nWhile there are likely to be some bumps along the way, there don\'t appear to be serious enough obstacles to stop the deal, according to Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\n\nTwitter or Musk can walk away from the deal if it’s not completed by Oct. 24, but if either Musk or Twitter is deemed responsible for the deal not going forward, they would have to pay a $1 billion termination fee, according to details of the transaction contained in a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The filing also showed that Twitter will drop a “poison pill” measure it had earlier adopted to defend against Musk\'s takeover by making it prohibitively expensive.\n\nNormally when companies go private, dissenting shareholders are forcibly cashed out. Some could challenge the stock price in court, contending that Musk should pay more, but that probably won’t hold up the sale, Elson said.\n\nIt’s likely that Musk would dissolve the current board and replace it with a new one that would agree with his management direction. And once Twitter is private, Musk will face fewer gripes from shareholders that often bring lawsuits, Elson said. Private companies also don’t face as much scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been a finger in Musk’s eye for years, often because of statements he\'s made on Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, shares of Twitter traded just under $50, below the $54.20 purchase price. Twitter will offer a glimpse into the health of its business when it reports its quarterly financial results Thursday.\n\nTwitter\'s constituents aren\'t the only ones anxious about Musk\'s $44 billion investment.\n\nShares of Musk\'s electric car company, Tesla, have lost about 19% of their value since Musk announced his stake in Twitter, including about a 12% decline on Tuesday. Analysts say investors are fearful that Musk will be distracted by the social media company and less engaged in running Tesla.\n\n“He’s going to be spending more time with another venture,” Edward Jones Senior Equity Analyst Jeff Windau said of Musk, who also runs SpaceX, The Boring Co., which digs tunnels, and Neuralink, a computer-brain interface company. “There’s a potential limit on the amount of bandwidth that you can apply to each of these companies."\n\n——\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

Musk said other investors could contribute to the financing.\n\nThe locked-in financing not only underscored the seriousness of Musk\'s pursuit, but also appeared to open the door to other large Twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the San Francisco company.\n\nThe details of those conversations aren’t known, but Musk could point to a more than 20-year history building and running several businesses — most notably as the longtime CEO of Tesla. The electric car maker is currently valued at $1 trillion -- roughly 25 times more than Twitter.\n\n“I think there is nothing better for Twitter than Elon Musk buying it and ideally replacing the board, and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue-generating sources," said John Meyer, a technology entrepreneur and investor. “Musk has the track record that he can do the impossible."\n\nIt would be easy to see why other Twitter shareholders might welcome a shake-up, as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment. Before Musk disclosed his 9% stake in Twitter earlier this month, the shares were trading below $40 — not that much more it its $26 price when Twitter went public in November 2013. Since then, the tech-driven Nasdaq has more than tripled, even after a recent downturn. Twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising, Google and Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla’s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010. And after struggling to make money for more than a decade, the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of $3.3 billion during the first three months of this year alone.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nAs is customary once a company agrees to be acquired, the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren’t any red flags that haven’t come up via the company’s public filings.\n\nThis step in the process isn’t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal, said Angelo Zino, tech analyst at CFRA.\n\n“He’s acquiring this company, not from a financial perspective,” Zino said. “He’s going to do what he wants with it and he’s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company.”\n\nWHAT SAY COULD REGULATORS HAVE?\n\nLast year, Twitter generated $5 billion in revenue, with $2.8 billion from the U.S. and the rest earned overseas, Zino said. The Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., or the European Commission in the EU, are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed Twitter buyout.\n\nThe main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry, or whether it violates antitrust laws.\n\nThese reviews can take months, or longer, but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining, or in the case of a single buyer, whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry.\n\nNeither Tesla, nor Musk’s other company, Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, are social media platforms, so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal, analysts said.\n\n“We do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with Musk owning Twitter,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Monday.\n\nWHEN DO SHAREHOLDERS GET TO VOTE?\n\nThe deal is expected to close in 2022, subject to the approval of Twitter shareholders. Twitter hasn’t announced the timing of a shareholder vote, though the company’s annual meeting is set for May 25, which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders.\n\nA company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time, even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TWITTER LEADERSHIP?\n\nAt this early stage, it’s unclear what will happen to Twitter\'s current board or management team if the deal is completed, but Musk has made it abundantly clear that he believes the company has been poorly run. That assessment is a strong indication that Musk’s makeover will also include a purge of Twitter’s top ranks.', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:29'}

Almost half of the respondents said that the industrial control systems were most frequently attacked.\n\nAnalysts say that the impacts of these attacks can range from company stocks being shorted or the lives of workers being put in danger when crucial operating systems are hacked to something as simple as assay results getting delayed.\n\nRELATED: Ransomware attack on mining operations “almost inevitable,” says cybersecurity expert\n\nFor instance, in the last five months British Columbia-based PJX Resources (TSXV: PJX) and Getchell Gold (US-OTC: GGLDF) in Nevada reported delays in receiving their assays as the Bureau Veritas Laboratory in Nevada was recovering from a cyber-attack that hit the company in November last year.\n\nNadine Miller, an engineer who has worked in mining for over two decades and is currently vice-president of project development at JDS Energy & Mining, notes that the industry has a tradition of being late adaptors to new technologies and is now also lagging behind in cyber security.\n\n“We are always in a race to be the first ones to be last in new technologies,” Miller told The Northern Miner, adding that mining companies generally don’t want to be early adaptors of any technology. “There are a few that will do it,” she said, adding they are usually larger companies.\n\nMiller says that while the mining industry has done a good job in securing its information technology (IT) systems, which include network infrastructures, file shares or employee laptops and computers, the operational technology (OT) – which, for example, involves systems responsible for process plants, refineries, heating or ventilation in underground mines – are not secure.\n\nBryan Tan, an Associate partner at EY’s cyber security practice says that ransomware, a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid, is one of the “key threats” in the industry right now.\n\n“A lot of organizations… put the OT systems on the same network as the IT systems,” he told The Northern Miner. “That starts to spread on the environment in the IT side, but because it can touch the OT systems, it can potentially impact those as well. From more of a business impact, your OT comes to a standstill and that may lead to life-threatening issues as well,” he explained.\n\nAI technology\n\nTo tackle OT-related issues, JDS and Miller are promoting a new technology, based on artificial intelligence machine learning (AI/ML), that they say can detect abnormalities in industrial control systems.\n\nMiller’s JDS colleague Joe Weiss, a global expert on industrial control systems, says that mining companies, like firms from other industries, depend upon sensors to run their operations. These can be hacked when connected to the web, a network, Bluetooth access via mobile devices, or simply a handheld calibration unit, and end up providing faulty signals that could, for instance, overheat or cool systems and damage them.\n\n“The JDS technology can tell you if the sensors are not doing exactly what they should be or if they are inoperable,” explains Weiss. “The sensors are the input to everything you do… the technology is making sure that the input going to the brain, is actually coming from the sensors and that we know how good the sensors are. And if (they’re) not, when we need to do maintenance for the sensors.”\n\nTo further explain the role that sensors play, Miller and Weiss referred to the Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station in the United States which overtopped in 2005 when water continued to be pumped from the lower reservoir even after the upper reservoir was full. While no deaths were reported during the event that wasn’t related to cyber-threat, the flood destroyed many structures in a park.\n\nAccording to Weiss, the attachments holding the sensors at Taum Sauk dam failed. Although they were detached from the wall and ended up at a different location, they continued to work. “They inadvertently told the system that the level was low,” said Weiss. As a result, the pumps were instructed to fill the reservoir. The JDS technology would have noted the change in the level and instructed the operator to check the problem, which is what makes the tool unique, he added.\n\nThe technology was installed in a refinery project this year, Miller said (the name of the company was not disclosed). Aside from providing protection against hacking, it also helped in detecting operational anomalies once the AI/ML went live, she said.\n\n“While the AI was learning their system, one of their engineers figured out that the controllers in the circuit was not working. We weren’t monitoring the controllers. But he realized that there was a problem with the controllers because the AI/ML was learning and the AI was flagging anomaly in the data,” said Miller.\n\nInvestment needed\n\nEY’s Tan believes that the mining industry has “moved forward” and is a lot more willing than before to improve its cyber security environment. But he also says that the industry needs to put more money into these initiatives and ensure that IT teams build stronger relationships with different parts of the business.\n\nAccording to EY’s survey, cybersecurity teams are struggling to build close relationships across the business — especially with teams that oversee the most critical systems and operational data.\n\n“The problem is that many chief information security officers came up through IT and, today, there is a paradigm clash between IT and OT,” the survey said. “On one hand, you’ve got engineers focused on availability and safety, on systems that are potentially decades old. On the other, you’ve got a CISO (chief information security officer) urging them to patch the system straight away because of confidentiality and integrity concerns.”', 'image': 'https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Engineer-in-control-room-scaled-1.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:42'}

Artificial intelligence (AI) assists under-resourced security operations analysts in keeping pace with attacks, and this technology will have a greater role as cyberattacks increase in volume and complexity. AI technologies, such as machine learning and natural language processing that analyze millions of research papers, blogs, and news stories, provide rapid insights to cut through the noise of daily alerts. AI provides analysts with a method to connect the dots between threats.\n\nTroubled waters\n\nThe enterprise attack surface continues to expand and get more complex. There may be hundreds of billion time-varying signals to evaluate, depending on the size of your business. As a result, cybersecurity analysis and improvement are no longer human-scale problems. To tackle this unprecedented danger, AI tools for cybersecurity have emerged to assist information security teams in reducing risk and enhancing their network security posture swiftly and successfully.\n\nMachine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence have grown in popularity as information security technologies that can rapidly analyze millions of events and find a variety of threats, from malware exploiting zero-day flaws to flagging risky behavior that might result in a phishing attack or malicious code download. AI can learn over time, drawing on its past experiences to identify new types of assaults as they emerge. AI can detect and react to deviations from normal patterns by utilizing conduct histories.\n\nThe fundamental issues with the traditional approaches\n\nRule-based detection systems have a major flaw: they produce many false positives. It’s not because the product is poorly designed or built. It is a problem with cybersecurity’s natural logic. If a breach occurs and the product fails to detect it, it can be devastating. As a result, every security solution strives to produce as few false negatives as possible by alerting every potential assault. The side effect is that false positives begin to arise. If you don’t want to miss a wolf, you’ll have to cry wolf whenever you suspect it’s lurking in the shadows.\n\nThe flood of mostly false warnings overwhelms human analysts. In the face of so many alerts, SOC analysts develop heuristics to handle them. After that, they do a thorough study on the filtered alerts. Other alarms are disregarded as a result of this procedure. This defense is ineffective when compared to the current state of sophisticated attacks. That seemingly benign warning could be the actual attack.\n\nAnother disadvantage traditional of cybersecurity is that it is asymmetrical. A cyber attacker must only succeed once in exploiting a single vulnerability. While we, the defenders, must be successful every time. Organizations need to search for threats across the whole IT stack, not just security data. AI can find patterns, anomalies, and outliers in all of this information without the requirement for set guidelines, then pass it on to human investigators.\n\nArtificial intelligence in cybersecurity allows businesses to utilize resources and personnel more effectively\n\nWhy do we need AI to guard the gates?\n\nHackers do not adhere to typical working hours, and their attacks come from any time and anywhere. As a result, real-time monitoring of your company’s IT infrastructure is required to detect malicious cyber dangers and data network security breaches.\n\nAI advancements in cybersecurity allow businesses to utilize money and personnel more effectively. Your company should allow AI-powered cybersecurity solutions to conduct security checks and give IT professionals the opportunity to evaluate genuine cyber threats identified by the software. This technique helps your company make the most of its cash and the time and skills of your IT staff.\n\nBenefits of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity\n\nMachine learning and AI can keep up with the bad actors by automating threat detection and response in today’s ever-changing cyber-attacks and enabling greater security than traditional software-driven methods.\n\nCybersecurity presents some unique challenges, such as vast attack surfaces deepened by the increased number of devices in organizations, new attack vectors, lack of skilled security experts, etc. Many of these issues can be addressed by a self-learning, AI-based cybersecurity posture management system.\n\nA self-learning system can continuously and independently gather data from information systems. That data is then analyzed, and millions to billions of relevant signals to the enterprise attack surface are related. Artificial intelligence in cybersecurity can automate threat detection and react quicker than traditional software-driven or manual approaches.\n\nAI learns about cybersecurity risks and threats by analyzing billions of data artifacts.\n\nThe technology focuses on the connections between threats. It takes seconds for AI to analyze relationships between threats such as malicious files, suspicious IP addresses, or insiders.\n\nAI enables security experts to make quicker, more informed judgments and act against threats with less time spent researching.\n\nFeatures of artificial intelligence for cybersecurity\n\nToday, the security teams of many organizations have delegated the most demanding tasks to AI-powered tools and are focusing on the important tasks that need the human touch. The notable uses and functions of artificial intelligence in cyber security are as follows:\n\nAutomated actions\n\nArtificial intelligence in cybersecurity can automate time-consuming activities for IT teams like responding to large numbers of low-risk security alerts. This is a situation where an alert requires immediate action, but the risks of making a mistake are low, and the system has a high level of certainty about the danger.\n\nAI can shut down network connectivity immediately if a known ransomware sample is discovered on an end user’s device to prevent the rest of the company from being infected. Smart automation can mitigate these concerns when necessary, allowing businesses to cope with a shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals.\n\nSimilarly, algorithms with artificial intelligence can gather security incident data from various systems and combine findings into a report for analysis.\n\nCognitive insights\n\nAI allows organizations to make sense of security events, gain cognitive insights, perform contextual analytics, and benchmark while protecting their endpoints, users, apps, documents, and data from one platform. AI can identify endpoint vulnerabilities, secure corporate data, and ease compliance.\n\nArtificial intelligence in cybersecurity can anticipate how and where you are most likely to be hacked, allowing you to plan ahead of time for resource and tool allocation toward areas of vulnerability. Prescriptive insights from AI analysis may assist you in optimizing controls and processes to improve your organization’s cybersecurity. This ability makes AI to best defense against zero-day attacks.\n\nArtificial intelligence in cybersecurity can anticipate how and where you are most likely to be hacked, allowing you to plan ahead of time for resource and tool allocation toward areas of vulnerability\n\nEarly detection of novel risks\n\nAn IT network or infrastructure can encounter two sorts of cybersecurity threats. The first is a new, unidentified danger, and the second is a known hazard that has already penetrated the network. Hackers are experts in breaching undetected data networks, and artificial intelligence in cybersecurity can prevent or neutralize these sophisticated hacking tactics to a greater degree.\n\nHackers are always looking for new ways to launch cyberattacks and make them more inconspicuous. Crypto-jacking, IoT malware assaults, and smartphone device malware are all examples of cyberattacks. Cross-site scripting is another form of method that hackers frequently employ.\n\nAdaptability\n\nAI-powered applications and programs utilize machine learning algorithms and deep learning. Artificial intelligence in cybersecurity may effortlessly comprehend numerous IT developments and adjust its algorithms to incorporate the most up-to-date data or information through these procedures. AI in cybersecurity is also familiar with sophisticated data networks that can quickly detect and eliminate security threats with minimal human involvement.\n\nAI in cybersecurity will not take the place of human cybersecurity experts. Instead, it aids security professionals in detecting and swiftly resolving deceptive network activities. Humans’ further advances in AI and machine learning through intervention will make AI more intelligent, with the potential to assist humans in return.\n\nSecurity intelligence\n\nCognitive AI understands indicators of compromise and obtains important insights due to its built-in machine learning capabilities. The technology combines thousands of devices, endpoint, application logs, and network flow data into a single alarm to help you speed up incident analysis and recovery.\n\nHand in hand with AI\n\nHumans and AI systems alone will not be able to overcome today’s cybersecurity difficulties. Cybersecurity automation has increased with machine learning technologies meant to assist enterprise security. There is less burnout, more precise threat detection, greater protection, and faster repair due to artificial intelligence in cybersecurity. To some extent, revolutionary technologies like AI-powered cybersecurity solutions have already begun to change the cybersecurity market. However, these technological advancements cannot be fully effective without human intervention.\n\nIn the field of cybersecurity, humans and AI technologies work well together. A team of cybersecurity specialists should aid the AI security system. The AI system can also help the team locate any potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and how they might become launching points for an attack.\n\nHumans and AI systems alone will not be able to overcome today’s cybersecurity difficulties\n\nThe human touch is required to prevent AI cybersecurity systems from creating security issues rather than fixing them. It’s usually better to balance artificial intelligence and human involvement when granting privileges to AI cybersecurity systems. When it comes to employing AI-enabled enterprise security solutions, there are certain restrictions. These systems can mostly be utilized as additional tools or smart assistants.\n\nLet’s examine an example of physical security at an automated security gate to make the point that humans should be included in AI-based cybersecurity systems. An automatic security gate can prevent unwanted entry and allow only authorized people to enter a property. But, extra safety, observation, and intimidation can be provided by employing human guards and an automated high-security barrier.\n\nArtificial intelligence algorithms make split-second decisions about your company’s cybersecurity. These judgments, however, are based on data and algorithms. Humans with cybersecurity expertise can be utilized alongside AI cybersecurity systems to ensure the system isn’t being tampered with or making incorrect judgments due to faulty logic.', 'image': 'https://dataconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity-3.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:05:15'}

Musk said other investors could contribute to the financing.\n\nThe locked-in financing not only underscored the seriousness of Musk\'s pursuit, but also appeared to open the door to other large Twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the San Francisco company.\n\nThe details of those conversations aren’t known, but Musk could point to a more than 20-year history building and running several businesses — most notably as the longtime CEO of Tesla. The electric car maker is currently valued at $1 trillion -- roughly 25 times more than Twitter.\n\n“I think there is nothing better for Twitter than Elon Musk buying it and ideally replacing the board, and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue-generating sources," said John Meyer, a technology entrepreneur and investor. “Musk has the track record that he can do the impossible."\n\nIt would be easy to see why other Twitter shareholders might welcome a shake-up, as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment. Before Musk disclosed his 9% stake in Twitter earlier this month, the shares were trading below $40 — not that much more it its $26 price when Twitter went public in November 2013. Since then, the tech-driven Nasdaq has more than tripled, even after a recent downturn. Twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising, Google and Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla’s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010. And after struggling to make money for more than a decade, the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of $3.3 billion during the first three months of this year alone.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nAs is customary once a company agrees to be acquired, the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren’t any red flags that haven’t come up via the company’s public filings.\n\nThis step in the process isn’t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal, said Angelo Zino, tech analyst at CFRA.\n\n“He’s acquiring this company, not from a financial perspective,” Zino said. “He’s going to do what he wants with it and he’s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company.”\n\nWHAT SAY COULD REGULATORS HAVE?\n\nLast year, Twitter generated $5 billion in revenue, with $2.8 billion from the U.S. and the rest earned overseas, Zino said. The Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., or the European Commission in the EU, are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed Twitter buyout.\n\nThe main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry, or whether it violates antitrust laws.\n\nThese reviews can take months, or longer, but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining, or in the case of a single buyer, whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry.\n\nNeither Tesla, nor Musk’s other company, Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, are social media platforms, so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal, analysts said.\n\n“We do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with Musk owning Twitter,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Monday.\n\nWHEN DO SHAREHOLDERS GET TO VOTE?\n\nThe deal is expected to close in 2022, subject to the approval of Twitter shareholders. Twitter hasn’t announced the timing of a shareholder vote, though the company’s annual meeting is set for May 25, which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders.\n\nA company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time, even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TWITTER LEADERSHIP?\n\nAt this early stage, it’s unclear what will happen to Twitter\'s current board or management team if the deal is completed, but Musk has made it abundantly clear that he believes the company has been poorly run. That assessment is a strong indication that Musk’s makeover will also include a purge of Twitter’s top ranks.', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:29'}

Get Started Now.\n\nThe content of large tech companies, like Google and Meta, will be more tightly regulated under a new European Union law that received provisional approval Saturday.\n\nAmong the provisions of the Digital Services Act approved in an agreement between the European Council and European Parliament are transparency measures on the algorithms used by online platforms and services to recommend content and products to users.\n\n“Platforms should be transparent about their content moderation decisions, prevent dangerous disinformation from going viral and avoid unsafe products being offered on market places,” Executive Vice-President for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n\n“With today’s agreement we ensure that platforms are held accountable for the risks their services can pose to society and citizens,” she added.\n\nHowever, Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a research and public policy organization in Washington, D.C. noted that it remains to be seen exactly how the EU will implement some of the new law’s requirements.\n\n“It’s possible that companies like Google and Meta are already meeting the DSA’s transparency requirements for ‘recommender systems’ under their existing disclosures to users,” he told TechNewsWorld.\n\n“And these companies have also made progress in the past few years in terms of better explaining to users how they use their information and how their platforms work, such as ad transparency and ad library,” he added.\n\nFocus on Big Tech\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen explained in a statement that the DSA will upgrade the ground rules for all online services in the EU.\n\n“It will ensure that the online environment remains a safe space, safeguarding freedom of expression and opportunities for digital businesses,” she said. “It gives practical effect to the principle that what is illegal offline, should be illegal online. The greater the size, the greater the responsibilities of online platforms.”\n\nAccording to the European Council, the obligations introduced in the new law are proportionate to the nature of the services concerned and tailored to the number of users. Very large online platforms and very large online search engines — defined as services with more than 45 million active monthly users — will be subject to more stringent requirements.\n\nTo safeguard the development of start-ups and smaller enterprises in the internal market, the council continued, micro and small enterprises with under 45 million monthly active users in the EU will be exempted from certain new obligations.\n\nA D V E R T I S E M E N T\n\n“With the DSA, the time of big online platforms behaving like they are ‘too big to care’ is coming to an end,” Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton said in a statement.\n\nCastro, though, maintained that the EU is making a mistake by focusing so much on the largest tech companies. “Smaller firms have a significant impact on consumers as well, and the largest companies are often the ones with the most resources and commitment to addressing harms,” he said.\n\nDrag on Innovation?\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story, but in a blog written by Karan Bhatia, vice president for global public affairs and government relations, posted in October, the company warned, “While we support the ambition of the DSA to create clear rules for the next 20 years that support economic growth, we worry that the new rules may instead slow economic recovery.”\n\n“They would prevent global technology companies like Google from building innovative digital tools like the ones that people have used through lockdown — and that will help European businesses rebuild their operations,” Bhatia wrote. “That would be a missed opportunity for Europe as it looks to the post-Covid future.”\n\nIn addition to algorithm transparency, other provisions empowering users and society include:\n\nThe possibility to challenge platforms’ content moderation decisions and seek redress, either via an out-of-court dispute mechanism or judicial redress; and\n\nAccess to vetted researchers to the key data of the largest platforms and provision of access to NGOs to public data to provide more insight into how online risks evolve.\n\nExplosion of Public Scrutiny\n\n“Even more impactful than making more information transparent about their algorithms is going to be the researcher data access provision,” observed Alex Engler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization in\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n“There’s only so much you can learn by telling people something broad about a complicated issue as the interaction between an algorithm and millions of people who use it on a daily basis, but when you let professional researchers study all of that , they can come away with much more nuanced, specific understanding of what’s going on,” he told TechNewsWorld.\n\n“Did a policy change lead to more disinformation? What are the mental health impacts of using social media?” he asked. “In those areas, we’ll see the most public scrutiny into large online platforms that the world has ever seen. Without any doubt, this will fundamentally change the level of public knowledge about these platforms.”\n\nHe explained that the DSA requires independent groups to validate what the companies are saying. “That gives them a lot less room to completely manipulate and hide the harms on their platforms,” he said.\n\nHe discounted concerns about the harm that opening algorithms to the public could have on the companies’ competitive edge.\n\nA D V E R T I S E M E N T\n\n“The competitive advantage of these companies comes more from their user base than the algorithms themselves,” he contended. “Facebook could tell me exactly how their algorithm works, and I wouldn’t be able to replicate the site because I don’t have billions of people coming to my website every day.”\n\nNot Leaving EU\n\n“The DSA is a significant piece of legislation, but it is unlikely to dramatically change the internet,” Castro noted.\n\n“It imposes a number of new obligations on large online platforms, however, none of the rules are so onerous that large tech companies will leave the European market,” he added.\n\n“A 450 million person market among the wealthiest countries in the world?” Engler asked. “I think the tech companies will comply with the new law.”\n\n“These requirements are not so invasive that these companies won’t be able to make money anymore,” he said, “so I would be very surprised to see them leave.”', 'image': 'https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/eu-gavel.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:55'}

These messages were sent to email addresses stolen from Mailchimp.\n\nMarks were told by these bogus emails to go to what turned out to be a malicious website – suite.trẹzor.com, note the special ẹ character – to download a new version of the Trezor desktop software suite that turned out to be wallet-draining malware. According to the lawsuit, this was also made possible because an Intuit staff apparently fell victim to a phishing attack in which they inadvertently handed over their internal credentials to one or more fraudsters.\n\n"Defendants fell victim to one of the oldest cybertricks in the book: according to reports, one of defendants\' employees fell victim to a phishing email and clicked on a malicious link," the plaintiff claimed. "Accordingly, the unknown hackers were able to pilfer Trezor platform users\' cryptocurrency from the compromised accounts, resulting in millions of dollars of losses."\n\nThe lawsuit claims the crooks were able to view about 300 Mailchimp customer accounts, and exfiltrate data, including subscriber email addresses, from 102 of them. One of the customer accounts was Trezor.\n\nIn a statement to The Register earlier this month, Mailchimp CISO Siobhan Smyth said the company\'s security engineers first became aware of the security breach on March 26 when a miscreant accessed a tool used by customer-facing teams for customer support and account administration. Smyth said the targeted campaign "was propagated by an external actor who conducted a successful social engineering attack on Mailchimp employees, resulting in employee credentials being compromised."\n\nLevinson raised the March 26 date in his lawsuit, saying it was "a week before the phishing emails were sent" yet Intuit didn\'t raise the alarm until Trezor did so when it spotted the phishing campaign.\n\n"This lack of action was particularly concerning, as Defendants acknowledged that the hackers targeted customers in the cryptocurrency and finance sectors and that the hackers gained access to API keys for an undisclosed number of customers, allowing the attackers to send phishing emails," the lawsuit stated.\n\nLevinson wants Intuit to pay for at least three years of credit monitoring for the victims as well as actual and punitive damages and legal fees. ®', 'image': 'https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/14/pickpocket_shutterstock.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:50'}

Since that vehicle\'s return, the manager of NASA\'s Commercial Crew Program, Steve Stich, said space agency and SpaceX engineers have been "poring over the data" on Dragon\'s performance during its return through the atmosphere.\n\n"It was a very clean flight overall, with really no major issues," Stich said Tuesday morning during a press call with reporters. "The team has looked through a lot of the data, and they\'ve had a chance to review everything. They\'ve looked at the thermal protection system.

Last fall, a Russian film crew flew up, followed by a Japanese fashion mogul and his assistant. In each case, an active-duty cosmonaut traveled with them.\n\nThe latest guests were accompanied by a former NASA astronaut now working for Axiom Space, the Houston company in charge of the flight, making it the first fully private trip to the space station.\n\nAfter hosting longer than expected, NASA was itching to make room for the next crew. SpaceX will attempt to launch three NASA astronauts and one Italian to the space station as soon as Wednesday. They’ll replace the three Americans and a German up there since November who will head back to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule.\n\nThe pace is blazingly fast by NASA standards. SpaceX’s Benji Reed said the company launched its first passengers — a pair of NASA test pilots — two years ago and just completed its first private flight to the space station using the same capsule.\n\nAxiom handled the logistics for the trip for its three paying customers: Connor from Dayton, Ohio; Canadian private equity CEO Mark Pathy; and Israeli investor Eytan Stibbe of Tel Aviv. Their chaperone was Michael Lopez-Alegria, an Axiom vice president who flew to space four times while a NASA astronaut.\n\nIt was an “amazing adventure that we’ve had, even longer and more exciting than we thought," Lopez-Alegria said after departing the space station.\n\nAxiom teamed up with SpaceX for the journey that began with an April 8 liftoff from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. It was SpaceX’s second private flight, coming just months after a billionaire’s orbital jaunt with contest winners.\n\nWhile in space, the visitors did experiments and peered back at Earth.\n\n“It’s been eye-opening in so many ways,” Pathy said, “that I think will have such a lasting impact on my life.”\n\nThe experience was especially personal for Stibbe. He served as a fighter pilot under Ilan Ramon, Israel’s first astronaut who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003.\n\nStibbe flew copies of the surviving pages of Ramon’s space diary, as well as artwork and music created by Ramon’s children. He celebrated Passover with matzah bread he took up and gefilte fish offered by the station’s Russians.\n\nAxiom’s second flight is set for next spring as the company looks ahead to having its own space station by 2030.\n\n“There were a lot of eyes on this mission just to see if it was practical,” Derek Hassmann, Axiom\'s operations director, said after the splashdown. “Everybody understood it was possible,” but wondered if amateurs could pull this off with abbreviated training, without disturbing the space station crew.\n\n“I think we proved we could do that," Hassmann said.\n\n———\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough." The decision to surround and contain continuing Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol has, the MoD thinks, both prevented redeployment of combat units from the south and reduced the effectiveness of those units.\n\nSaturday\'s situation report from the UK\'s MoD sees a protracted reset of Russian preparation to complete operations in Ukraine: "Defence Secretary Shoygu’s stated intent to introduce \'new methods of warfare\' is a tacit admission that Russian progress is not going as intended. While it may indicate an understanding that the war is not progressing as planned it will take some time to translate this into adapted tactics, techniques and procedures, and then implement for improved operational effect particularly in regards to land-based manoeuvre warfare." In the meantime the Russian army will rely on heavy and indiscriminate artillery fire. "Therefore, in the interim there is likely to be a continued reliance on bombardment as a means of trying to suppress Ukrainian opposition to Russian forces," the situation report concludes.\n\nReduction of cities by artillery is the one tactic the Russian army has shown itself able to execute; the Telegraph reports on the effects of fatigue and failure on the morale and efficiency of Russian maneuver units. Yesterday\'s MoD situation report drew attention to the friction low morale is imposing on Russian operations. "Ukraine has repelled numerous Russian assaults along the line of contact in the Donbas this week. Despite Russia making some territorial gains, Ukrainian resistance has been strong across all axes and inflicted significant cost on Russian forces. Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganise forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness."\n\nConcealing the scale of losses.\n\nThe British MoD also sees signs that the Russian government is working to minimize public awareness of the size of losses it\'s sustaining in the invasion of Ukraine. "Russia’s Ministry of Defence has proposed compensation payments for the families of deceased service personnel be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia’s losses from the domestic population."\n\nRussian conscription of Ukrainians?\n\nUkraine has expressed concern that occupying Russian forces will seek to redress personnel shortfalls by conscripting Ukrainians and forcing them to fight on behalf of Russia. The British MoD explained yesterday that Moscow has done this before: "The Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate and General Staff have accused Russia of planning to conscript Ukrainian civilians from the Russian occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. This would follow similar prior conscription practices in the Russian-occupied Donbas and Crimea." Such conscription violates the Geneva Convention, and would amount to another systematic Russian war crime: "Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states \'the Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces\', and \'no pressure or propaganda which aims at securing voluntary enlistment is permitted\'. \'Protected persons\' in this context includes civilians within occupied territories. Any enlistment of Ukrainian civilians into the Russian armed forces, even if presented by Russia as being voluntary or military service in accordance with Russian law, would constitute a violation of Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention."\n\nIt would be a violation of other laws of war as well. The International Committee of the Red Cross has a searchable guide to International Humanitarian Law where summaries of applicable law may be found:\n\n"Article 44 of the 1899 Hague Regulations provides: \'Any compulsion of the population of occupied territory to take part in military operations against its own country is prohibited.\'”\n\n"Article 23(h) of the 1907 Hague Regulations provides: \'A belligerent is likewise forbidden to compel the nationals of the hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed against their own country, even if they were in the belligerent’s service before the commencement of the war.\'”\n\n"Article 51, first paragraph, of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV provides: \'The Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces. No pressure or propaganda which aims at securing voluntary enlistment is permitted.\'”\n\n"Article 130 of the 1949 Geneva Convention III and Article 147 of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV provide that compelling a prisoner of war or a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile power is a grave breach of these instruments."\n\nThe protections have also been recognized in Russian domestic military regulations: "Under the Russian Federation’s Military Manual (1990), it is prohibited as a method of warfare \'to compel persons belonging to the enemy party to participate in hostilities against their country\'." The Russian Federation’s Regulations on the Application of IHL (2001) also state: “It is prohibited to compel the population in the occupied territory to serve in the armed or auxiliary forces of the occupying power.”\n\nStamp collecting.\n\nThe Snake Island garrison\'s defiant "Russian warship, go f**k yourself" became a rallying call in Ukraine, especially after the Moskva, the Russian warship to whom the message was directed, sank after being hit by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles. Ukrposhta, Ukraine\'s national postal service, issued stamps commemorating the incident, showing a Ukrainian soldier (presumably Roman Hrybov, who radioed the defiant reply to Moskva\'s demand that the garrison surrender) flipping the bird in the direction of a large but ineffectual looking Moskva. Within a few days of the stamp\'s issue, Ukrposhta said it had come under a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack apparently intended to disrupt domestic and international sales of the commemorative stamp. Ukrposhta offered no attribution, but in this case the circumstantial evidence pointing to Moscow is, as Gizmodo points out, too obvious to ignore. The postal service is working through the effects of the DDoS attack, and says that a lot of people are still getting through to buy the stamp. (Supplies are limited, collectors; act now.)\n\n#OpRussia: Anonymous counts coup.\n\nThe hacktivist collective has tweeted Its tally of recent successes claimed against Russian organizations: "#OpRussia: Since declaring \'cyber war\' on Kremlin\'s criminal regime, the #Anonymous collective has now published approximately 5.8 TB of Russian data via #DDoSecrets. #Anonymous vows to release more data belonging to Russian entities and government, including a commercial bank."\n\nOn Sunday Security Affairs published the results of its sifting through the documents Anonymous had leaked "over the last three days" and found that files were taken from four commercial businesses:\n\n"Enerpred is the largest producer of hydraulic tools in Russia and the CIS, specializing in the energy, petrochemical, coal, gas and construction industries. The collective has leaked a 432GB archive containing 645,000 emails."\n\n"Accent Capital is a commercial real-estate investment firm that owns or is directly involved with the management of many of the properties its clients invest in. The collective has leaked a 211GB archive containing 365,000 emails."\n\n"Sawatzky is a property management company. Sawatzky’s clients include Du Pont, Lenovo, Whirlpool, Aveva, Wella, Johnson + Johnson, Cisco, Google, Swatch, Avito, Samsung, Microsoft, Western Union, Saint-gobain, Turkish Airlines, and British American Tobacco. The collective has leaked a 432GB archive containing 575,000 emails."\n\n"Worldwide Invest is an investment firm with ties to Estonia and Russian railways. The collective has leaked a 130GB archive containing 250,000 emails."\n\nThat #OpRussia represents a successful hacktivist action seems beyond dispute, but its achievements also seem to confirm that hacktivism in this ongoing hybrid war has yet to rise above nuisance levels. The nuisance is real, but it remains exactly that: a nuisance.\n\n"Lacryphages," privateers, and state actors.\n\nAnonymous has been operating in the Ukrainian interest. There has been evidence of hacktivism in the Russian interest as well, although in that case it\'s difficult to distinguish from opportunistic cybercrime that exploits sympathy for Ukrainian suffering ("lachryphagy," "drinking of tears," in the colorful term used by an op-ed in TheHill), gangland privateering, and direct state action. CNN reports that humanitarian organizations working on Ukrainian relief have been the targets of phishing, or, as CNN puts it "malicious links and pornographic material on their cell phones." Most aid organizations are relatively poorly protected non-governmental organizations, and in many cases have difficulty even recognizing that they\'re under attack, still less able to respond to an attack quickly and effectively. CNN quotes Amazon Web Services as explaining that the attacks seem intended to “to spread confusion and cause disruption,” which seems particularly odious when the activities being disrupted are the distribution of food, clothing, and medical supplies.\n\nSpeculation about reasons for restraint in cyberspace.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald offers seven possible explanations for Russian offensive cyber operations to have remained at a nuisance level in Russia\'s hybrid war against Ukraine:\n\n"Ukrainians are ready for it." The Ukrainians have had help." "Russia may not want to destroy services it plans to exploit." "Russia may be holding back." "In a brutal war, cyber may not be needed." "Russian cyber troops may be overrated." "The ransomware epidemic alerted the world."\n\nSome, all, or none of these may be true, but the summary provides a useful compendium of speculation about the failure of large-scale, devastating cyberattacks to materialize.\n\nAlternative energy suppliers in Europe sustain cyberattacks.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that three alternative energy companies in Europe have sustained cyberattacks since Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine began. WindEurope, a wind-power industry group based in Brussels, says it believes the attacks originate with Russia. Presumably the goal is to make a shift from Russian oil and natural gas more difficult for European, especially German, markets. Two German turbine manufacturers (Enercon GmbH and Nordex SE) and one turbine maintenance firm (Windtechnik AG) have been affected.\n\nDisinformation: forged document claims Ukraine is reselling military aid to African countries.\n\nThe Atlantic Council offers a debunking of claims in the Kremlin-aligned Telegram channel Rezident that Ukraine planned to sell surplus "armored cars, tanks, submachine guns, rifles, grenades, and bulletproof vests to African countries." All of that materiel, Rezident says, represents equipment Ukrainian forces need at the front, and the story has been amplified in other Telegram accounts as well as various Vkontakte pages. The document being circulated, and which is being represented as an official report from the Ministry of Defense to Ukraine\'s parliament, is clearly a forgery. It uses Russian orthography, for example, and it refers to organizations that no longer exist. The goal of the disinformation is to insinuate that Ukraine is beset by corruption. Rexident says “While Ukrainian soldiers are dying due to the absence of weaponry, clerks from the Ministry of Defense are selling it under the premise of redundancy,” and adds that the whole (fictitious) scheme amounts to a “cunning scheme of enrichment.”\n\nRosaviatsiya recommends that Russian airlines prepare for operations without GPS.\n\nIsvestia reports that the Russian federal air transport authority, Rosaviatsiya, has counseled airlines to be prepared to operate without GPS. "This is due to its possible shutdown, as well as "jamming" of GPS signals and spoofing attacks when flying in the Kaliningrad region, over the Black Sea, east of Finland and the Mediterranean." GPS spoofing and jamming have been reported in those regions by Western sources, and that activity has generally been chalked up to Russian operators, but Isvestia offers no such attribution. RIA Novosti cites Roskosmos to the effect that it would be difficult to selectively turn GPS off in Russia, and that in any case GLONASS offers a viable alternative to GPS.', 'image': 'https://thecyberwire.com/images/social-media/articles/pro/cw-pro-image-25.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:05:01'}

"Russian forces are likely attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the east of Ukraine. The city of Kreminna has reportedly fallen and heavy fighting is reported south of Izium, as Russian forces attempt to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east. Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south."\n\nUkraine has apparently taken the war to Russia with what are generally thought to have been strikes against two fuel facilities in the Russian city of Bryansk. The Telegraph reports (with video) that the installations (about seventy kilometers from the Ukrainian border) that informed speculation holds that the fires were caused either by a Ukrainian special forces raid or by a Ukrainian Tochka missile. The incident represents the seventh apparent Ukrainian strike at targets in Russia.\n\nThere are also reports of minor attacks in Transdnistria, a Moldovan province Russia detached as a nominally independent (but generally unrecognized) country. Russia, Moldova, and Ukraine point with alarm to the incident, and Russia and Ukraine accuse one other of mounting a provocation intended to expand Russia\'s war. The targets were two antennas in Tiraspol that were associated with pro-Russian radio stations.\n\nForeign Minister Lavrov warns that there are limits to Russia\'s good will.\n\nHe was speaking mendaciously, but without irony. "Goodwill has its limits," the Telegraph quotes Mr. Lavrov as saying in a Russian television interview. "But if it isn\'t reciprocal, that doesn\'t help the negotiation process." He was objecting to what he characterized as Ukrainian bad faith in negotiations aimed at ending Russia\'s war of aggression. He also pointed with grim regret at the possibility of nuclear war, which of course (he said) Russia doesn\'t want. The US characterized Mr. Lavrov\'s remarks as "escalatory rhetoric."\n\nMr. Lavrov\'s remarks came after US Secretary of Defense Austin said not only that he expected a Ukrainian victory, and that the US supported Ukraine\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but that it was in the US interest to see Russia so weakened that it would be incapable of future aggression of the kind its undertaken against Ukraine. When asked about Secretary Austin\'s expression of US policy goals, US Secretary of State Blinken said, "I think the secretary said it very well."\n\nWestern governments generally interpreted Foreign Minister Lavrov\'s allusions to the risk of nuclear war as a threat, but have shrugged it off as they increase delivery of weapons to Ukraine. Britain has joined the US and Canada in shipping 155mm howitzers to Ukraine. This is a standard NATO caliber, and, when coupled with delivery of US Firefinder radars, strongly suggests that Ukraine is being armed with an effective counterfire capability that will give them the means of precisely locating and quickly destroying the Russian artillery that\'s represented the most destructive form of combat power Moscow has been able to deploy in a war it\'s otherwise tactically mismanaged. Germany, in a surprising move given Berlin\'s unwillingness to become more heavily involved in direct, lethal materiel support for Ukraine, has announced that it will send Kyiv Gephard mobile air defense systems. These will address the other principal Russian threat: air strikes, particularly battlefield air interdiction.\n\nMoscow has accused the US and its allies of waging a "proxy war" against Russia. "The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it," Reuters quotes Mr. Lavrov as saying. "NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war." The US has convened an international conference at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to discuss Russia\'s war against Ukraine. Breaking Defense reports that forty-three nations are participating.\n\nPlanting and eventual harvest as collateral damage.\n\nThe British Ministry of Defence situation report on Russia\'s war against Ukraine yesterday focused on disruption of Ukrainian agriculture. "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production. The Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20 per cent lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following the invasion. Ukraine is the fourth largest producer and exporter of agricultural goods in the world. Reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain. High grain prices could have significant implications for global food markets and threaten global food security, particularly in some of the least economically developed countries."\n\nNATO expansion.\n\nFinland and Sweden, Reuters reports, are expected to formally request NATO membership in May.', 'image': 'https://thecyberwire.com/images/social-media/articles/pro/cw-pro-image-26.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:27'}

Now, the IT security researchers at CySource have reported a method to abuse the VirusTotal malware scanning service to execute arbitrary commands and access multiple internal hosts remotely by using a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2021-22204).\n\nAccording to researchers, the vulnerability could allow attackers to weaponize the VirusTotal platform and achieve remote code execution on an unpatched 3rd party sandboxing machine employing anti-virus engines.\n\nHow Could the Vulnerability be Exploited?\n\nIsraeli security services provider CySource’s researchers Shai Alfasi and Marlon Fabiano da Silva embedded a payload in the DjVu file’s metadata for exploiting the vulnerability, identified in ExifTool open-source utility. This utility extracts Exchangeable Image File annotations, metadata, and tags.\n\nMoreover, it can trigger another vulnerability to obtain remote code execution. This vulnerability is triggered by DjVu files and was identified by researcher William Bowling in 2021 in ExifTool 12.23. It was surprising that none of the VirusTotal anti-virus scanners could detect the CySource researchers’ Base64 encoded payload they included in the malicious DjVu file’s metadata.\n\n“Instead of ExifTool detecting the metadata of the file, it executes our payload.” CySource\n\nThe researchers also got a reverse shell that allowed them to access over 50 internal network hosts with high privileges at Google and its other VirusTotal security vendor partners. Every time they uploaded a file with a new hash and a new payload, VirusTotal forwarded it to bots.\n\nThis indicates that apart from an RCE, the payload was forwarded by Google servers to the company’s internal network, partners, and customers as well. When researchers were able to invade the networks, they mapped out various services, including MySQL, Kubernetes container orchestration, Oracle databases, web applications, and Secure Shell (SSH).\n\nMore Vulnerability News on Hackread.com\n\nGoogle Released Patch after Eight Months\n\nThe vulnerability was disclosed to Google’s vulnerability reward program in April 2021, and the report was accepted in May 2021. However, the fix was dispatched in January 2022, after which CySource received the green signal to share details of the bug.\n\nIt is still unclear why Google took so long to fix this vulnerability. VirusTotal is a trusted service from Google’s subsidiary Chronicle, offering access to more than 70 different anti-virus scanning solutions from mainstream security vendors, including ESET, Kaspersky, and 360 Total Security. It is, therefore, quite shocking that a dangerous remote code execution vulnerability plagued this service for over eight months.', 'image': 'https://www.hackread.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/virustotal-malware-vulnerability.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:48'}

But it, too, merits attention.\n\nThe alert served as a reminder of the two species of cyber threat: the unpredictable, spinning-pinball threats that can lurch out of control and pulverize innocents in random fashion — and the intricately designed, coolly targeted threats meant to ransack a particular organization\'s servers and perhaps its bank account.\n\nThe Ukraine clash may generate plenty of damage of the first type. Indeed, it may already be doing so. But while that conflict progresses, the second type of threat, epitomized by ransomware, is taking no holidays.\n\nA Formal Alarm\n\nIssued in February, days before hostilities broke out between Russia and Ukraine, the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory from the FBI, CISA (the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), and the NSA sounded a formal alarm about "an increase in sophisticated, high-impact ransomware incidents against critical infrastructure organizations globally."\n\nAttack targets are no longer predictably the biggest, richest organizations, according to the report. Ransomware groups have learned to infiltrate enterprise SaaS platforms and exploit them as hubs for firing off waves of malevolent executables at scale, victimizing platform clients, both large and small. According to the advisory, the FBI in 2021 "observed some ransomware threat actors redirecting ransomware efforts away from \'big-game\' and toward mid-sized victims to reduce scrutiny." The FBI’s counterpart agencies in the UK and Australia, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) and Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), concurred that organizations "of all sizes" suffered ransomware attacks throughout the year.\n\nOn the one hand, in this national security sphere, any additional recognition or investment at the top of government is overdue and cannot hurt. On the other, recognition does not mean the government has the reach or means to protect you — something the two species of cyber threat have in common.\n\nWho\'s in Charge?\n\nOne early, grim lesson of the Ukraine cyberwar is that no authority is firmly in charge and no government agency can consistently shield its citizens from blowback. Governments aren\'t even supervising some of the cyber combatants: freelance hacktivists like Anonymous, jamming Russian broadcast channels and the Kremlin website, answer to their own moral code, not a central command in Kyiv. And Ukraine\'s own "I.T. Army" is a barely directed worldwide corps of digital adepts connecting via Telegram to wreak cyber havoc.\n\nWhat could go awry in that woolly, infinitely multilateral conflict sphere? No national cyber defense framework can keep innocent parties from becoming collateral damage.\n\nThe thing is, no government ransomware policy can unilaterally create a safer, more secure environment either.\n\nGovernment cannot remake the trend throughout the private sector toward hybrid compute workloads. With a thoughtful hybrid strategy, an enterprise hosts its more sensitive workloads on-premises, and deploys less critical resources to a more economical third-party public cloud provider. The practice may yield savings, but with the simultaneous concern that roles and responsibilities once firmly controlled by data center operators may be much less clearly delineated. Involving cloud providers makes evaluating risk and modeling effective security controls more complex. It must be done, but it is up to individual organizations.\n\nGovernment can recommend private interests perform overdue software updates or implement dual-factor authentication protocols. But those best practices will never be mandated by act of Congress; they are up to individual organizations.\n\nInfluencers from security agencies can keynote one conference after another, emphasizing today\'s key challenge for CISOs everywhere: threat visibility across the environments they\'re laboring to secure. CISOs can\'t defend against threats they can’t see. Total, real-time visibility into IT and cloud infrastructure is the ideal; the reality is, almost all organizations lack it. They\'re unaware of what devices and individuals are connected, with what access to sensitive systems and data. Visibility into third-party access to company systems also remains poor. To spot ransomware before it digs in and does damage, CISOs should be adopting security solutions that visualize an entire attack surface. But the initiative to make such visibility a top priority must come from CISOs themselves.\n\nFamiliar Advice\n\nThe conclusions drawn by the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory are recommendations, not directives — and if you\'ve been tracking the rise of ransomware, they feel familiar: Keep systems and software up to date. Train workers to spot phishing links and dodgy attachments. Implement 2FA. Back up your data. We have heard this advice before; the advisory simply delivers it from a higher-echelon source.\n\nThat doesn\'t mean it\'s dismissible — quite the contrary. But what is really important is how organizations everywhere react. The Ukraine conflict is erasing the last vestiges of complacency about the destabilizing, out-of-control threat of cyber weapons. We should do all we can to see that this cybersecurity advisory does the same for the threat of well-controlled, ruthlessly targeted cyber piracy.', 'image': 'https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt66983808af36a8ef/blt5cd0db1cd55a65fc/6217f9bab4efa244505bb288/Malware_marcos_alvarado_Alamy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:05:13'}

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication and authorization by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.\n\nMany versions of Jira are affected, but the vendor noted that Jira Cloud and Jira Service Management Cloud are not impacted. Fixes are included in versions 8.13.18, 8.20.6 and 8.22.0 or newer.\n\nCVE-2022-0540 can be leveraged to bypass authentication and authorization requirements in WebWork actions that use an affected configuration, but the attack only works if the action does not perform other authentication or authorization checks.\n\n“Although the vulnerability is in the core of Jira, it affects first and third party apps that specify roles-required at the webwork1 action namespace level and do not specify it at an action level,” Atlassian explained in its advisory.\n\nThe company added, “Although app configuration is one factor that determines whether or not it is vulnerable, it is not the cause of the vulnerability. These apps are correctly using documented functionality that was previously implemented by Jira and Jira Service Management in a vulnerable way.”\n\nAtlassian has listed two of its own apps as being affected — “Insight - Asset Management” and “Mobile Plugin for Jira” — as well as 200 applications from the Atlassian marketplace. In the case of the Insight app, an authenticated attacker could also exploit the flaw for arbitrary code execution.\n\nRegardless of the applications they use, users are protected against attacks if they update Jira. Users who cannot immediately install the Jira patches can update the affected apps to a version that is not affected — if such a version is available — or they can disable impacted apps until a fixed version is released. Some app developers were made aware of this issue before it was publicly disclosed so they have already updated their code.\n\nA researcher from Viettel Cyber Security has been credited for reporting the vulnerability.\n\nIn addition to an advisory, Atlassian has made available an FAQ document for CVE-2022-0540.\n\nThreat actors exploiting vulnerabilities in Atlassian products is not unheard of. Last year, attempts to exploit a flaw in the Confluence enterprise collaboration product were spotted just one week after a patch was announced.\n\nRelated: Atlassian Patches Critical Code Execution Vulnerability in Confluence\n\nRelated: Atlassian Patches Critical Vulnerability in Jira Data Center Products\n\nRelated: Researchers Detail Exploit Chain for Hijacking Atlassian Accounts', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:34'}

At one point, the stock was down as much as 19%.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group recently launched Truth Social, a Twitter clone aimed at conservatives whom Trump claims Twitter has silenced.\n\n“There’s no need to download Truth Social if you can get it on Twitter,” said Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, which provides IPO-focused ETFs and pro-IPO research.\n\nSince the final trading day before Musk surprised Wall Street by saying he had amassed a stake in Twitter, Digital World has lost 44% of its value. The special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, closed at $63.25 on April 1 before Musk’s announcement April 4.\n\nMusk, a longtime critic of Twitter’s content moderation policies, has vowed to transform Twitter in part by bolstering free speech on the platform. The Tesla CEO agreed to buy Twitter in a deal that values the company at about $44 billion.\n\nA Musk-run Twitter would undercut the rationale for Truth Social, which Trump had promised would “stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.” There is even speculation that Twitter, under Musk’s control, could lift the ban on Trump himself.\n\nTrump weighed in on the issue on Monday, telling Fox News he will not return to Twitter despite Musk’s takeover.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nBelow $36, the implied valuation of Trump Media & Technology Group has tumbled to roughly $7.7 billion, according to Kennedy of Renaissance Capital. That’s down sharply from around $13 billion before Musk disclosed his Twitter investment.\n\n“While the market apparently believes that a Twitter owned by Elon Musk dims the outlook of Truth Social, Trump still has some financial incentives to use Truth,” Kennedy said.\n\nBeyond Musk’s efforts to acquire Twitter, the Trump SPAC has been hurt by the slow start of Truth Social. As CNN reported earlier this month, Truth Social has been plagued by a lengthy waitlist, a lack of content and high-profile contents that appear to be bots.\n\nAt the same time, federal regulators are investigating the Trump SPAC deal and legal experts have told CNN that securities regulators could slow or even derail the merger altogether.\n\nSince hitting a 2022 high of $101.87 on March 2, Digital World is down by about 65%.', 'image': 'https://www.siliconvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hypatia-h_966261470293a8a1f93e0f1c60a617b0-h_3b2f0a435c1f422f2276b67d7f2909d3.jpg?w=1024&h=711', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:04:35'}

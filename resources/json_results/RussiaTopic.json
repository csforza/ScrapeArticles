This morning, the situation in the unrecognized Russian enclave in Moldova worsened and people began to leave the borders in crowds.\n\nUkrainian intelligence reports that in unrecognized Transnistria a few days ago they began to prepare for \"explosions\" organized by the FSB to justify war with Ukraine or to involve the \"republic\" in hostilities, according to UNIAN.\n\nThe council of the self-proclaimed republic has declared a \"red\" level of terrorist threat due to three registered \"terrorist attacks\".\n\nTerrorist attacks include a strange RPG attack on the Ministry of State Security building in Tiraspol yesterday, a hit on the military barracks in Parcani and the detonation of a radio tower near the village of Mayak.\n\nThe President of Moldova convened a meeting of the Security Council in connection with the situation in occupied Transnistria. All educational institutions there switched to distance learning by the end of the school year. Checkpoints will be set up at the entrances to the cities, and inspections of vehicles and citizens will be carried out selectively during the day. During the night the control measures will be applied to everyone who enters a settlement.\n\nRussian military bases, the army and weapons depots are located on the territory of Transnistria, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Russia's General Rustam Minekayev, deputy commander of Russia's Central Military District, said last week that the population in the separatist republic was oppressed, and the second phase of the \"military operation,\" as the Kremlin calls the war in Ukraine, plans for the take over of Donbas and southern Ukraine by creating a corridor between Russia from to the Crimea to Transnistria.\n\nRussian media claim that Chisinau is putting economic pressure on Tiraspol and predict that the conflict could end with the \u201cliberation\u201d of Transnistria through Ukraine during a special military operation, given that in a referendum not even recognized by Moscow, the citizens of the \"republic\" voted to join the Russian Federation.\n\nAt the start of the war, Russia accused Ukraine of attacking the Russians in Transnistria. Kyiv immediately replied that this was a preparation for staging a Ukrainian attack and inventing an occasion for the Russian army to enter there as well.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko denied yesterday that Russia was seeking a way out of Transnistria and that it was holding a referendum on \"independence\" in Kherson. Vladimir Putin himself and Russian officials have denied, to the last, the US intelligence that Russia will invade Ukraine.\n\nMoscow-backed Transnistrian separatists waged war against the newly independent Moldova in 1992, and a truce led to the de facto separation of the region from Chisinau.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\n\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 - Novinite.bg\n\n/OFFNews",

Serbia, one of the few European countries still maintaining air traffic with Russia, let Russian diplomats who were declared persona non grata in the countries they served board the planes.\n\nAccording to Flightradar24, the same plane flew on 17 April from Moscow to Copenhagen, but pilots at the time avoided flying over counties which closed their airspace to Russia.\n\nSerbia has so far failed and refused to align itself with EU sanctions against Russia. President Aleksander Vucic has also stopped short of condemning the invasion of Ukraine. Several pro-Russia demonstrations have also taken place in the capital of Belgrade over the last two months.\n\nBulgarian media quoted a government official who said the plane will transport the Russian diplomats who have been declared personae non grata in various EU countries and have been unable to return to Russia due to lack of flights.",

        "text": "Vladimir Putin is carrying out his threats: he has asked the Russian gas giant to suspend deliveries to countries that refuse to pay in rubles. In the theater of operations, the bombings are intensifying in Moldova.\n\nThe information given this Tuesday, April 26 at about 19 hours by the portal Onet, has been confirmed by the Polish company PGNiG. Gazprom will no longer deliver gas to Poland via the Yamal pipeline from this Wednesday morning. The ultimatum set by Putin to pay in Russian currency expired last Friday. Most European Union countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept this diktat.\n\n\u201cNot a danger for Poland\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes as Warsaw later today published a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, targeted by sanctions allowing their assets to be frozen under a law passed this month. This is a separate measure from the sanctions taken in coordination with the other countries of the European Union, says the portal Onet.\n\n\u201cSince the first day of the war, we have declared that we are ready for total independence from Russian raw materials,\u201d said Polish Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nPoland\u2019s energy supply is not in danger, however, the Polish climate ministry said, adding that there was no need to tap into gas reserves and that consumer access would not be interrupted.\n\n\u201cThe gas pipeline that connects us to Norway will be put into operation this year in October, said Piotr Naimski, government plenipotentiary for strategic energy infrastructure, at the European Economic Congress 2022. The gas port has already been expanded in the first phase. It has the capacity to receive 6.3 billion cubic meters of gas per year. Norway\u2019s gas pipeline is 10 billion cubic meters.\u201d\n\nNo more Russian gas to Bulgaria\n\n\u201cToday, Bulgargas EAD has been informed that Gazprom Export deliveries will be suspended from April 27, 2022,\u201d the Ministry of Economy said in a statement, while the Balkan country is heavily dependent on Russian gas.\n\nBulgaria is 90% dependent on Russian gas. But the leaders say they can quickly become independent of Russia.\n\nThe bombing intensifies\n\nOn the 62\u1d49 day of the war, Russia continues the bombing as the United States and about 40 of its allies met in Germany to provide even more heavy weapons to Ukraine, giving it the means to defend itself and win the war.\n\nKiev has accused Moscow of seeking to \u201cdestabilize\u201d the pro-Russian Moldovan separatist region of Transnistria, which borders Ukraine but is pro-Russian. Washington fears an escalation of the conflict that could lead to a general conflagration.",

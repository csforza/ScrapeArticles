The Ukrainian defence ministry called the events a “planned provocation by the Russian special services.” Moldova’s president warned they were an attempt to escalate tensions, blaming “pro-war factions” within the breakaway territory.\n\nHere is what you should know about Transnistria and why it matters in the context of the continuing Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nWhat is Transnistria?\n\nTransnistria, also commonly known as Transdniester, is a narrow strip of land between the east bank of the Dniester River and Moldova’s border with Ukraine.\n\nOf a total population of about 470,000 people, ethnic Russians and Ukrainians together outnumber ethnic Moldovans.\n\nWhile internationally recognised as part of Moldova, the Russian-backed breakaway territory has been under the control of separatist authorities since 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union triggered a conflict between the newly independent Republic of Moldova and separatists who wanted to maintain Soviet ties.\n\nNo country, including Russia, recognises the territory as independent, but Moldovan authorities have no control over the region, which functions akin to a separate state.\n\nWhat does Transnistria have to do with the Russia-Ukraine conflict?\n\nRussia has an estimated 1,500 soldiers in Transnistria, which Moscow refers to as a “peacekeeping” force. Kyiv is concerned that those forces could be used to attack Ukraine from the west.\n\nRussia carried out military drills in the region as recently as February 2, and has said the Russian presence is essential to protect their citizens in the area and keep the peace between Moldovans and Transnistrians.\n\nShould Russian President Vladimir Putin decide to involve Transnistria in the war in some capacity, it has little leverage to refuse, as it remains economically dependent on Russia, including for free gas.\n\nWhat are Russia’s interests in Transnistria?\n\nRustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia’s central military district, was quoted last week by state news agencies as saying that Russia aimed to take control of southern Ukraine, which would give it access to Transnistria.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Russian military, embroiled in a fight to take eastern Ukraine, would be able to seize more territory in southern Ukraine and advance towards Moldova.\n\nBut Russia could potentially seek to use Transnistria to assist with medical aid and food, guarding convoys and securing the railway network, and offering a safe space where to resupply its troops, repair equipment and regroup.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Russia’s invasion of his country was just the beginning and that Moscow has designs on seizing territory in other countries, as well.\n\nIs Moldova a NATO member?\n\nMoldova is a not part of the transatlantic military alliance and has sought to stay neutral since its independence, with neutrality enshrined in its constitution.\n\nThere are concerns about its ability to defend itself from a potential Russian invasion should Putin push towards its border with Ukraine.\n\nHowever, last month the nation of about 2.6 million submitted a bid to join the European Union, along with Georgia and Ukraine.\n\nDoes Russia have ambitions in the region?\n\nA week into Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, a video surfaced showing Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko standing next to a map that appeared to indicate Transnistria as a potential target.\n\nOfficials in Belarus later said the map was a mistake.\n\nMoldova has a long history of domination by the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union. However, it has been transitioning away from Russian influence since the 1990s, slowly moving towards Europe.', 'image': 'https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/000_328Y72Y-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C630', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:01:06'}

With its unique position of having friendly relations with both Russia and Ukraine, Turkey has won widespread praise for its push to end the war.\n\nSince the beginning of the conflict, Ankara has offered to mediate between the two sides and host peace talks, underlining its support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. While Ankara has opposed international sanctions designed to isolate Moscow, it also closed its straits to prevent some Russian vessels from crossing through them.\n\nIn a breakthrough, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met for peace talks in Istanbul on March 29 as the war entered its second month with casualties piling up on both sides.\n\nDuring the talks, Ukrainian officials signaled readiness to negotiate a “neutral status,” a key Russian demand, but demanded security guarantees for their country. Ukraine wants to see countries, including Turkey, as guarantors in a deal with Russia, a Ukrainian negotiator said after the talks. Russia, meanwhile, pledged to significantly decrease its military activities focusing on the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv to build trust for future negotiations.\n\nTurkey also hosted the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine in Antalya last month.', 'image': 'https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2022/04/26/thumbs/800x531/201960.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:51'}

It didn’t name the suspects or provide evidence to support the allegations. It\n\nsaid some of the suspects were held as captives, without specifying where, while other charges were being prepared in\n\nabsentia.\n\n\n\nUkraine says it is investigating some 7,600 potential war crimes and at least 500 suspects following Russia’s February 24\n\ninvasion of its neighbor. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told Reuters that many of those suspects are in Russia but some\n\nhave been taken captive by Ukraine as prisoners of war. Speaking in an interview earlier this month, she said that her office\n\nintends to follow the chain of command up the Russian political and military hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenediktova added that she plans to pursue prosecutions both in Ukrainian courts as well as at the International Criminal\n\nCourt in The Hague, the world’s permanent war crimes tribunal.\n\n\n\nThe Kremlin and Russia’s defense ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment. Moscow has rejected allegations by Ukraine and Western nations of war crimes and has denied targeting civilians in what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” to demilitarize its neighbor.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s probe is at the center of multiple efforts to investigate potential war crimes related to the conflict, including by the ICC. The probes are at the very early stages, people familiar with them say. The ICC has sent an advance team to the region to establish operations.\n\n\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of genocide against Russian speakers, which Kyiv strongly denies. Russia has also opened criminal cases into Ukrainian servicemen’s alleged torture of their Russian counterparts.\n\n\n\nUkraine, which is conducting its investigation while still in the throes of war, is scrambling to assemble teams of specialists with war crimes expertise, evaluating potential crimes and developing its prosecution strategy.\n\n\n\n“You can see they are now exhuming the bodies, so [the investigation is at a] very early stage,” a person familiar with the process said. In terms of strategy, Kyiv plans to prosecute as much as it can in Ukrainian courts but would likely leave any\n\ncases involving higher-ranking figures to the ICC, the person added.\n\n\n\nThe UN has also established its own inquiry into possible violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine, including possible war crimes, which could feed into any prosecutions by the ICC.\n\n\n\nThere is also a European Union-coordinated effort to fast track sharing of evidence between various investigating authorities, including with the ICC. Several European countries have said they will apply universal jurisdiction, the legal principle that some crimes are so terrible they can be heard by foreign national courts, and their prosecutors could launch investigations into Ukrainian atrocities.\n\n\n\nFor Ukraine, the immediate challenge is the sheer volume of potential evidence and witness testimony that needs to be secured and recorded in a way that is usable in court, legal specialists say. That includes vast amounts of digital imagery as well as material gathered on the ground.\n\n\n\nDavid Schwendiman, a former US federal prosecutor who has also helped prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan\n\nwars in the 1990s, praised Ukraine’s prosecutor general as talented and courageous but said the country doesn’t have\n\nexperience of an investigation of this scale and will need outside help processing potential crime scenes in a way that\n\nmeets international standards.\n\n\n\n“Every one of those bodies is a crime scene. Every one of those buildings is a crime scene. Every city is a crime scene,” Schwendiman said. Something as small as a piece of cloth torn from a uniform, an ammunition shell, or even a ligature used to tie someone’s hands could help identify a particular unit involved and so needs to be carefully preserved, he added.\n\n\n\nZera Kozlyieva, deputy head of the war crimes unit in the prosecutor general’s office, acknowledged that limited access due to ongoing hostilities and a shortage of war crimes specialists presented challenges. Speaking Thursday on a panel at international affairs think tank Chatham House, she said that Kyiv is seeking help from international experts.\n\nWar crimes allegations\n\nImages of dead civilians in Ukraine, including of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, have prompted international outrage, with US President Joe Biden calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be investigated for war crimes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused invading Russian troops of committing “the most terrible war crimes” since World War Two.\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations, as of April 22 more than 2,400 civilians had been killed since the conflict began in late February. But the official count is likely to climb. In the port city of Mariupol alone, local authorities have said thousands of\n\npeople have been killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder international law, war crimes include intentionally targeting civilian populations, willfully killing or causing suffering, and widespread destruction among other serious violations of laws applicable in armed conflict. Individuals who commit such crimes can be prosecuted by international tribunals such as the ICC and by states.\n\n\n\nExperts for the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) nations said in a report published earlier this month that they found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia in Ukraine. The experts also said in\n\nthe report that they’d found evidence of violations of international humanitarian law by Ukraine, particularly in its\n\ntreatment of prisoners of war, but that Russia’s violations “are by far larger in nature and scale.”\n\n\n\nUkraine has said it checks all information regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action. Russia has said the report “is based solely on unfounded propaganda theses, contains references to dubious sources and logical stretches in the style of ‘highly likely.’“\n\nUkraine’s probe\n\nThe prosecutor general’s office had in recent years established a special unit to investigate potential crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 but Kyiv continues to claim as part of Ukraine, and Donbas.\n\n\n\nMoscow’s February invasion of its Western neighbor forced Kyiv to scale up what had been a relatively small team of prosecutors.\n\n\n\nVenediktova and her team have in recent weeks been evaluating sites where atrocities have taken place, including where Russian troops have recently withdrawn.\n\n\n\nOn April 12, Venediktova visited Bucha, near Kyiv, where French forensic experts had arrived to help Ukraine authorities\n\nestablish what happened in the town where hundreds of bodies have been discovered. As the group from the French Gendarmerie’s forensic science department looked on, workers in hazmat suits dug earth from a shallow grave and lifted out a heavy mass wrapped in an orange blanket. Citing witnesses, Venediktova said during the visit that the burnt body parts inside were those of a woman and her two children.\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia has said that images and footage of dead bodies strewn across Bucha were fake.\n\n\n\nVenediktova is also drawing on international legal expertise and seeking technical assistance. She has announced the\n\nformation of a task force of law firms and prominent international human rights lawyers, including Amal Clooney, to advise on securing accountability for Ukrainian victims in national jurisdictions as well as strategic guidance on cooperating with the ICC.\n\n\n\nVenediktova is in regular contact with Beth Van Schaack, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice in the US\n\nState Department, who said the two have discussed what additional assistance Washington could provide. Van Schaack’s\n\noffice has been helping to deploy specialists on the ground via a joint US-European project.\n\n\n\nVan Schaack told Reuters that Venediktova’s requests for assistance include forensics expertise, such as helping determine how victims found in mass graves died and whether potential signs of torture were inflicted prior to death. Other requests include help identifying the type and origins of particular ballistics used as well as assistance clearing any mines left by Russians so that her investigators can safely access those areas.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s potentially biggest challenge, said Van Schaack, will be gaining custody of suspects, particularly those higher up the command chain. If they remain in Russia, they may “enjoy impunity for the rest of their days,” she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nUN expects more than 8 mln Ukrainians to flee as refugees\n\nUK dismisses Lavrov’s ‘bravado,’ says no imminent threat of nuclear arms in Ukraine\n\nUS hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase', 'image': 'https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2022/04/26/0cbc91cc-00ca-4495-be49-dbebf0e0cda6/0cbc91cc-00ca-4495-be49-dbebf0e0cda6_16x9_600x338.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:53'}

Kyiv is concerned that those forces could be used to attack Ukraine from the west.\n\nRussia carried out military drills in the region as recently as February 2, and has said the Russian presence is essential to protect their citizens in the area and keep the peace between Moldovans and Transnistrians.\n\nShould Russian President Vladimir Putin decide to involve Transnistria in the war in some capacity, it has little leverage to refuse, as it remains economically dependent on Russia, including for free gas.\n\nWhat are Russia’s interests in Transnistria?\n\nRustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia’s central military district, was quoted last week by state news agencies as saying that Russia aimed to take control of southern Ukraine, which would give it access to Transnistria.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Russian military, embroiled in a fight to take eastern Ukraine, would be able to seize more territory in southern Ukraine and advance towards Moldova.\n\nBut Russia could potentially seek to use Transnistria to assist with medical aid and food, guarding convoys and securing the railway network, and offering a safe space where to resupply its troops, repair equipment and regroup.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Russia’s invasion of his country was just the beginning and that Moscow has designs on seizing territory in other countries, as well.\n\nIs Moldova a NATO member?\n\nMoldova is a not part of the transatlantic military alliance and has sought to stay neutral since its independence, with neutrality enshrined in its constitution.\n\nThere are concerns about its ability to defend itself from a potential Russian invasion should Putin push towards its border with Ukraine.\n\nHowever, last month the nation of about 2.6 million submitted a bid to join the European Union, along with Georgia and Ukraine.\n\nDoes Russia have ambitions in the region?\n\nA week into Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, a video surfaced showing Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko standing next to a map that appeared to indicate Transnistria as a potential target.\n\nOfficials in Belarus later said the map was a mistake.\n\nMoldova has a long history of domination by the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union.

Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told Reuters that many of those suspects are in Russia but some\n\nhave been taken captive by Ukraine as prisoners of war. Speaking in an interview earlier this month, she said that her office\n\nintends to follow the chain of command up the Russian political and military hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenediktova added that she plans to pursue prosecutions both in Ukrainian courts as well as at the International Criminal\n\nCourt in The Hague, the world’s permanent war crimes tribunal.\n\n\n\nThe Kremlin and Russia’s defense ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment. Moscow has rejected allegations by Ukraine and Western nations of war crimes and has denied targeting civilians in what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” to demilitarize its neighbor.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s probe is at the center of multiple efforts to investigate potential war crimes related to the conflict, including by the ICC. The probes are at the very early stages, people familiar with them say. The ICC has sent an advance team to the region to establish operations.\n\n\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of genocide against Russian speakers, which Kyiv strongly denies. Russia has also opened criminal cases into Ukrainian servicemen’s alleged torture of their Russian counterparts.\n\n\n\nUkraine, which is conducting its investigation while still in the throes of war, is scrambling to assemble teams of specialists with war crimes expertise, evaluating potential crimes and developing its prosecution strategy.\n\n\n\n“You can see they are now exhuming the bodies, so [the investigation is at a] very early stage,” a person familiar with the process said. In terms of strategy, Kyiv plans to prosecute as much as it can in Ukrainian courts but would likely leave any\n\ncases involving higher-ranking figures to the ICC, the person added.\n\n\n\nThe UN has also established its own inquiry into possible violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine, including possible war crimes, which could feed into any prosecutions by the ICC.\n\n\n\nThere is also a European Union-coordinated effort to fast track sharing of evidence between various investigating authorities, including with the ICC. Several European countries have said they will apply universal jurisdiction, the legal principle that some crimes are so terrible they can be heard by foreign national courts, and their prosecutors could launch investigations into Ukrainian atrocities.\n\n\n\nFor Ukraine, the immediate challenge is the sheer volume of potential evidence and witness testimony that needs to be secured and recorded in a way that is usable in court, legal specialists say. That includes vast amounts of digital imagery as well as material gathered on the ground.\n\n\n\nDavid Schwendiman, a former US federal prosecutor who has also helped prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan\n\nwars in the 1990s, praised Ukraine’s prosecutor general as talented and courageous but said the country doesn’t have\n\nexperience of an investigation of this scale and will need outside help processing potential crime scenes in a way that\n\nmeets international standards.\n\n\n\n“Every one of those bodies is a crime scene. Every one of those buildings is a crime scene. Every city is a crime scene,” Schwendiman said. Something as small as a piece of cloth torn from a uniform, an ammunition shell, or even a ligature used to tie someone’s hands could help identify a particular unit involved and so needs to be carefully preserved, he added.\n\n\n\nZera Kozlyieva, deputy head of the war crimes unit in the prosecutor general’s office, acknowledged that limited access due to ongoing hostilities and a shortage of war crimes specialists presented challenges. Speaking Thursday on a panel at international affairs think tank Chatham House, she said that Kyiv is seeking help from international experts.\n\nWar crimes allegations\n\nImages of dead civilians in Ukraine, including of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, have prompted international outrage, with US President Joe Biden calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be investigated for war crimes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused invading Russian troops of committing “the most terrible war crimes” since World War Two.\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations, as of April 22 more than 2,400 civilians had been killed since the conflict began in late February. But the official count is likely to climb. In the port city of Mariupol alone, local authorities have said thousands of\n\npeople have been killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder international law, war crimes include intentionally targeting civilian populations, willfully killing or causing suffering, and widespread destruction among other serious violations of laws applicable in armed conflict. Individuals who commit such crimes can be prosecuted by international tribunals such as the ICC and by states.\n\n\n\nExperts for the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) nations said in a report published earlier this month that they found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia in Ukraine. The experts also said in\n\nthe report that they’d found evidence of violations of international humanitarian law by Ukraine, particularly in its\n\ntreatment of prisoners of war, but that Russia’s violations “are by far larger in nature and scale.”\n\n\n\nUkraine has said it checks all information regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action. Russia has said the report “is based solely on unfounded propaganda theses, contains references to dubious sources and logical stretches in the style of ‘highly likely.’“\n\nUkraine’s probe\n\nThe prosecutor general’s office had in recent years established a special unit to investigate potential crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 but Kyiv continues to claim as part of Ukraine, and Donbas.\n\n\n\nMoscow’s February invasion of its Western neighbor forced Kyiv to scale up what had been a relatively small team of prosecutors.\n\n\n\nVenediktova and her team have in recent weeks been evaluating sites where atrocities have taken place, including where Russian troops have recently withdrawn.\n\n\n\nOn April 12, Venediktova visited Bucha, near Kyiv, where French forensic experts had arrived to help Ukraine authorities\n\nestablish what happened in the town where hundreds of bodies have been discovered. As the group from the French Gendarmerie’s forensic science department looked on, workers in hazmat suits dug earth from a shallow grave and lifted out a heavy mass wrapped in an orange blanket. Citing witnesses, Venediktova said during the visit that the burnt body parts inside were those of a woman and her two children.\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia has said that images and footage of dead bodies strewn across Bucha were fake.\n\n\n\nVenediktova is also drawing on international legal expertise and seeking technical assistance. She has announced the\n\nformation of a task force of law firms and prominent international human rights lawyers, including Amal Clooney, to advise on securing accountability for Ukrainian victims in national jurisdictions as well as strategic guidance on cooperating with the ICC.\n\n\n\nVenediktova is in regular contact with Beth Van Schaack, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice in the US\n\nState Department, who said the two have discussed what additional assistance Washington could provide. Van Schaack’s\n\noffice has been helping to deploy specialists on the ground via a joint US-European project.\n\n\n\nVan Schaack told Reuters that Venediktova’s requests for assistance include forensics expertise, such as helping determine how victims found in mass graves died and whether potential signs of torture were inflicted prior to death.

It\n\nsaid some of the suspects were held as captives, without specifying where, while other charges were being prepared in\n\nabsentia.\n\n\n\nUkraine says it is investigating some 7,600 potential war crimes and at least 500 suspects following Russia’s February 24\n\ninvasion of its neighbor. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told Reuters that many of those suspects are in Russia but some\n\nhave been taken captive by Ukraine as prisoners of war. Speaking in an interview earlier this month, she said that her office\n\nintends to follow the chain of command up the Russian political and military hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenediktova added that she plans to pursue prosecutions both in Ukrainian courts as well as at the International Criminal\n\nCourt in The Hague, the world’s permanent war crimes tribunal.\n\n\n\nThe Kremlin and Russia’s defense ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment. Moscow has rejected allegations by Ukraine and Western nations of war crimes and has denied targeting civilians in what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” to demilitarize its neighbor.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s probe is at the center of multiple efforts to investigate potential war crimes related to the conflict, including by the ICC. The probes are at the very early stages, people familiar with them say. The ICC has sent an advance team to the region to establish operations.\n\n\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of genocide against Russian speakers, which Kyiv strongly denies. Russia has also opened criminal cases into Ukrainian servicemen’s alleged torture of their Russian counterparts.\n\n\n\nUkraine, which is conducting its investigation while still in the throes of war, is scrambling to assemble teams of specialists with war crimes expertise, evaluating potential crimes and developing its prosecution strategy.\n\n\n\n“You can see they are now exhuming the bodies, so [the investigation is at a] very early stage,” a person familiar with the process said. In terms of strategy, Kyiv plans to prosecute as much as it can in Ukrainian courts but would likely leave any\n\ncases involving higher-ranking figures to the ICC, the person added.\n\n\n\nThe UN has also established its own inquiry into possible violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine, including possible war crimes, which could feed into any prosecutions by the ICC.\n\n\n\nThere is also a European Union-coordinated effort to fast track sharing of evidence between various investigating authorities, including with the ICC. Several European countries have said they will apply universal jurisdiction, the legal principle that some crimes are so terrible they can be heard by foreign national courts, and their prosecutors could launch investigations into Ukrainian atrocities.\n\n\n\nFor Ukraine, the immediate challenge is the sheer volume of potential evidence and witness testimony that needs to be secured and recorded in a way that is usable in court, legal specialists say. That includes vast amounts of digital imagery as well as material gathered on the ground.\n\n\n\nDavid Schwendiman, a former US federal prosecutor who has also helped prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan\n\nwars in the 1990s, praised Ukraine’s prosecutor general as talented and courageous but said the country doesn’t have\n\nexperience of an investigation of this scale and will need outside help processing potential crime scenes in a way that\n\nmeets international standards.\n\n\n\n“Every one of those bodies is a crime scene. Every one of those buildings is a crime scene. Every city is a crime scene,” Schwendiman said. Something as small as a piece of cloth torn from a uniform, an ammunition shell, or even a ligature used to tie someone’s hands could help identify a particular unit involved and so needs to be carefully preserved, he added.\n\n\n\nZera Kozlyieva, deputy head of the war crimes unit in the prosecutor general’s office, acknowledged that limited access due to ongoing hostilities and a shortage of war crimes specialists presented challenges. Speaking Thursday on a panel at international affairs think tank Chatham House, she said that Kyiv is seeking help from international experts.\n\nWar crimes allegations\n\nImages of dead civilians in Ukraine, including of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, have prompted international outrage, with US President Joe Biden calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be investigated for war crimes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused invading Russian troops of committing “the most terrible war crimes” since World War Two.\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations, as of April 22 more than 2,400 civilians had been killed since the conflict began in late February. But the official count is likely to climb. In the port city of Mariupol alone, local authorities have said thousands of\n\npeople have been killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder international law, war crimes include intentionally targeting civilian populations, willfully killing or causing suffering, and widespread destruction among other serious violations of laws applicable in armed conflict. Individuals who commit such crimes can be prosecuted by international tribunals such as the ICC and by states.\n\n\n\nExperts for the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) nations said in a report published earlier this month that they found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia in Ukraine. The experts also said in\n\nthe report that they’d found evidence of violations of international humanitarian law by Ukraine, particularly in its\n\ntreatment of prisoners of war, but that Russia’s violations “are by far larger in nature and scale.”\n\n\n\nUkraine has said it checks all information regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action. Russia has said the report “is based solely on unfounded propaganda theses, contains references to dubious sources and logical stretches in the style of ‘highly likely.’“\n\nUkraine’s probe\n\nThe prosecutor general’s office had in recent years established a special unit to investigate potential crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 but Kyiv continues to claim as part of Ukraine, and Donbas.\n\n\n\nMoscow’s February invasion of its Western neighbor forced Kyiv to scale up what had been a relatively small team of prosecutors.\n\n\n\nVenediktova and her team have in recent weeks been evaluating sites where atrocities have taken place, including where Russian troops have recently withdrawn.\n\n\n\nOn April 12, Venediktova visited Bucha, near Kyiv, where French forensic experts had arrived to help Ukraine authorities\n\nestablish what happened in the town where hundreds of bodies have been discovered. As the group from the French Gendarmerie’s forensic science department looked on, workers in hazmat suits dug earth from a shallow grave and lifted out a heavy mass wrapped in an orange blanket. Citing witnesses, Venediktova said during the visit that the burnt body parts inside were those of a woman and her two children.\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia has said that images and footage of dead bodies strewn across Bucha were fake.\n\n\n\nVenediktova is also drawing on international legal expertise and seeking technical assistance. She has announced the\n\nformation of a task force of law firms and prominent international human rights lawyers, including Amal Clooney, to advise on securing accountability for Ukrainian victims in national jurisdictions as well as strategic guidance on cooperating with the ICC.\n\n\n\nVenediktova is in regular contact with Beth Van Schaack, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice in the US\n\nState Department, who said the two have discussed what additional assistance Washington could provide. Van Schaack’s\n\noffice has been helping to deploy specialists on the ground via a joint US-European project.\n\n\n\nVan Schaack told Reuters that Venediktova’s requests for assistance include forensics expertise, such as helping determine how victims found in mass graves died and whether potential signs of torture were inflicted prior to death. Other requests include help identifying the type and origins of particular ballistics used as well as assistance clearing any mines left by Russians so that her investigators can safely access those areas.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s potentially biggest challenge, said Van Schaack, will be gaining custody of suspects, particularly those higher up the command chain. If they remain in Russia, they may “enjoy impunity for the rest of their days,” she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nUN expects more than 8 mln Ukrainians to flee as refugees\n\nUK dismisses Lavrov’s ‘bravado,’ says no imminent threat of nuclear arms in Ukraine\n\nUS hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase', 'image': 'https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2022/04/26/0cbc91cc-00ca-4495-be49-dbebf0e0cda6/0cbc91cc-00ca-4495-be49-dbebf0e0cda6_16x9_600x338.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:53'}

It didn’t name the suspects or provide evidence to support the allegations. It\n\nsaid some of the suspects were held as captives, without specifying where, while other charges were being prepared in\n\nabsentia.\n\n\n\nUkraine says it is investigating some 7,600 potential war crimes and at least 500 suspects following Russia’s February 24\n\ninvasion of its neighbor. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told Reuters that many of those suspects are in Russia but some\n\nhave been taken captive by Ukraine as prisoners of war. Speaking in an interview earlier this month, she said that her office\n\nintends to follow the chain of command up the Russian political and military hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenediktova added that she plans to pursue prosecutions both in Ukrainian courts as well as at the International Criminal\n\nCourt in The Hague, the world’s permanent war crimes tribunal.\n\n\n\nThe Kremlin and Russia’s defense ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment. Moscow has rejected allegations by Ukraine and Western nations of war crimes and has denied targeting civilians in what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” to demilitarize its neighbor.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s probe is at the center of multiple efforts to investigate potential war crimes related to the conflict, including by the ICC. The probes are at the very early stages, people familiar with them say. The ICC has sent an advance team to the region to establish operations.\n\n\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of genocide against Russian speakers, which Kyiv strongly denies. Russia has also opened criminal cases into Ukrainian servicemen’s alleged torture of their Russian counterparts.\n\n\n\nUkraine, which is conducting its investigation while still in the throes of war, is scrambling to assemble teams of specialists with war crimes expertise, evaluating potential crimes and developing its prosecution strategy.\n\n\n\n“You can see they are now exhuming the bodies, so [the investigation is at a] very early stage,” a person familiar with the process said. In terms of strategy, Kyiv plans to prosecute as much as it can in Ukrainian courts but would likely leave any\n\ncases involving higher-ranking figures to the ICC, the person added.\n\n\n\nThe UN has also established its own inquiry into possible violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine, including possible war crimes, which could feed into any prosecutions by the ICC.\n\n\n\nThere is also a European Union-coordinated effort to fast track sharing of evidence between various investigating authorities, including with the ICC. Several European countries have said they will apply universal jurisdiction, the legal principle that some crimes are so terrible they can be heard by foreign national courts, and their prosecutors could launch investigations into Ukrainian atrocities.\n\n\n\nFor Ukraine, the immediate challenge is the sheer volume of potential evidence and witness testimony that needs to be secured and recorded in a way that is usable in court, legal specialists say. That includes vast amounts of digital imagery as well as material gathered on the ground.\n\n\n\nDavid Schwendiman, a former US federal prosecutor who has also helped prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan\n\nwars in the 1990s, praised Ukraine’s prosecutor general as talented and courageous but said the country doesn’t have\n\nexperience of an investigation of this scale and will need outside help processing potential crime scenes in a way that\n\nmeets international standards.\n\n\n\n“Every one of those bodies is a crime scene. Every one of those buildings is a crime scene. Every city is a crime scene,” Schwendiman said. Something as small as a piece of cloth torn from a uniform, an ammunition shell, or even a ligature used to tie someone’s hands could help identify a particular unit involved and so needs to be carefully preserved, he added.\n\n\n\nZera Kozlyieva, deputy head of the war crimes unit in the prosecutor general’s office, acknowledged that limited access due to ongoing hostilities and a shortage of war crimes specialists presented challenges. Speaking Thursday on a panel at international affairs think tank Chatham House, she said that Kyiv is seeking help from international experts.\n\nWar crimes allegations\n\nImages of dead civilians in Ukraine, including of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, have prompted international outrage, with US President Joe Biden calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be investigated for war crimes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused invading Russian troops of committing “the most terrible war crimes” since World War Two.\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations, as of April 22 more than 2,400 civilians had been killed since the conflict began in late February. But the official count is likely to climb. In the port city of Mariupol alone, local authorities have said thousands of\n\npeople have been killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder international law, war crimes include intentionally targeting civilian populations, willfully killing or causing suffering, and widespread destruction among other serious violations of laws applicable in armed conflict. Individuals who commit such crimes can be prosecuted by international tribunals such as the ICC and by states.\n\n\n\nExperts for the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) nations said in a report published earlier this month that they found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia in Ukraine. The experts also said in\n\nthe report that they’d found evidence of violations of international humanitarian law by Ukraine, particularly in its\n\ntreatment of prisoners of war, but that Russia’s violations “are by far larger in nature and scale.”\n\n\n\nUkraine has said it checks all information regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action. Russia has said the report “is based solely on unfounded propaganda theses, contains references to dubious sources and logical stretches in the style of ‘highly likely.’“\n\nUkraine’s probe\n\nThe prosecutor general’s office had in recent years established a special unit to investigate potential crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 but Kyiv continues to claim as part of Ukraine, and Donbas.\n\n\n\nMoscow’s February invasion of its Western neighbor forced Kyiv to scale up what had been a relatively small team of prosecutors.\n\n\n\nVenediktova and her team have in recent weeks been evaluating sites where atrocities have taken place, including where Russian troops have recently withdrawn.\n\n\n\nOn April 12, Venediktova visited Bucha, near Kyiv, where French forensic experts had arrived to help Ukraine authorities\n\nestablish what happened in the town where hundreds of bodies have been discovered. As the group from the French Gendarmerie’s forensic science department looked on, workers in hazmat suits dug earth from a shallow grave and lifted out a heavy mass wrapped in an orange blanket. Citing witnesses, Venediktova said during the visit that the burnt body parts inside were those of a woman and her two children.\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia has said that images and footage of dead bodies strewn across Bucha were fake.\n\n\n\nVenediktova is also drawing on international legal expertise and seeking technical assistance. She has announced the\n\nformation of a task force of law firms and prominent international human rights lawyers, including Amal Clooney, to advise on securing accountability for Ukrainian victims in national jurisdictions as well as strategic guidance on cooperating with the ICC.\n\n\n\nVenediktova is in regular contact with Beth Van Schaack, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice in the US\n\nState Department, who said the two have discussed what additional assistance Washington could provide. Van Schaack’s\n\noffice has been helping to deploy specialists on the ground via a joint US-European project.\n\n\n\nVan Schaack told Reuters that Venediktova’s requests for assistance include forensics expertise, such as helping determine how victims found in mass graves died and whether potential signs of torture were inflicted prior to death. Other requests include help identifying the type and origins of particular ballistics used as well as assistance clearing any mines left by Russians so that her investigators can safely access those areas.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s potentially biggest challenge, said Van Schaack, will be gaining custody of suspects, particularly those higher up the command chain. If they remain in Russia, they may “enjoy impunity for the rest of their days,” she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nUN expects more than 8 mln Ukrainians to flee as refugees\n\nUK dismisses Lavrov’s ‘bravado,’ says no imminent threat of nuclear arms in Ukraine\n\nUS hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase', 'image': 'https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2022/04/26/0cbc91cc-00ca-4495-be49-dbebf0e0cda6/0cbc91cc-00ca-4495-be49-dbebf0e0cda6_16x9_600x338.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:53'}

Arrest and detention or release, either way it doesn\'t really matter, because the simple truth is that Israeli state violence against Palestinians in Al-Aqsa during Ramadan is now so routine that it is taken for granted.\n\nIsraelis get away with it by describing each and every Palestinian killed, wounded or arrested as a "terrorist". A lawyer shot and killed as he dropped children off at school in Nablus this week, Mohammed Assaf, 34, was also just another "terrorist" according to one Israeli media source. His killer was an Israeli soldier who opened the door of his jeep and fired at random as it sped past; the driver didn\'t even slow down or stop. A drive-by killing with a difference: the criminal in an Israeli uniform knows that he will get away with it; that there will be no international outcry; no new "Palestinian Lives Matter" demonstrations; nothing except another funeral in a Palestinian village. Life will go on. It was just another day in occupied Palestine.\n\nAnd that is where the single, underlying cause of the violence lies: Palestine is under a brutal military occupation. We tend to forget that; at least the Western Zionist media and politicians do. To them, it\'s a "dispute" over "contested" territory. They may have short memories, but the facts are on the record for all to see.\n\nREAD: Mass protest in front of London Israel embassy\n\nThe infamous 1917 Balfour Declaration doesn\'t even mention the indigenous Palestinian population by name; it describes them as the "non-Jewish" population. Nor were the Palestinians consulted about the 1947 UN Partition Plan which split their land in two: the larger part was designated as a "Jewish state", leaving the rest as an "Arab state". Jerusalem was supposed to be an international city, not the "undivided capital" of Israel, as the latter claims and Donald Trump accepted in 2018. As I said, memories are short.\n\nAccept the very concept of the state of Israel as it was called in May 1948, and you condone the ethnic cleansing that Zionist militias and terrorist gangs conducted to drive out more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homes and land. In other words you condone the occupation of Palestine which began in 1948 and has expanded ever since with massacres, bombs, bullets and casual violence of the kind that killed Mohammed Assaf.\n\nIsrael gets away with it because it has been emboldened by the immunity granted to it by the international community. Hence, even though UN officials may condemn what Israel does, and the UN General Assembly may pass resolution after resolution pointing out, for example, the legitimacy of armed resistance to a military occupation — that\'s right, it\'s not "terrorism" — and the right of return for all refugees, but such resolutions are not binding on member states, leaving Israel free to do what it wants. If matters escalate and actually reach the UN Security Council, Israel\'s back is covered by the US veto, and the violence of the Zionist state and its settlers — all of whom are illegal — continues unabated, leading to many more "just another day in occupied Palestine" incidents.\n\nUntil and unless Israel\'s ability to act with impunity is brought to an end, this will remain the case, and many more innocent bystanders will lose their lives at the hands of trigger-happy Israeli police and troops. Remember this the next time you read about "Israeli-Palestinian clashes" and that, "The violence has sparked international fears of conflict, a year since similar unrest led to an 11-day war between Israel and militants in Gaza." If a brutal military occupation isn\'t already enough to be "conflict" enough to have "sparked international fears", then I don\'t know what is.\n\nThat sentence by Agence France-Presse in the Guardian says it all. The international community continues to overlook Israel\'s occupation and the fact that this is a nuclear-armed, belligerent state taking on a largely civilian population; continues to believe that Israel is the victim of "terrorism"; and continues to insist that only bogus "peace negotiations" and further "concessions" by the Palestinians — a euphemism for surrender — will end the cycle of violence. The international community is wrong. The only way to end the violence is to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine.\n\nIsrael\'s founding ideology, Zionism, insists that only "Greater Israel" will suffice, and that means taking ever more Palestinian land with ever fewer Palestinians on it. Successive Israeli governments don\'t want any old peace; they want peace on their terms, which means no Palestinians in the historic land of Palestine. Anyone who believes otherwise is ignoring the reality of the ongoing ethnic cleansing and has clearly bought into the Zionist narrative. Forget Passover and Ramadan, Israel\'s violence is rooted in its heart and soul; it\'s all about the brutal Israeli military occupation and colonisation of Palestine.\n\nREAD: PA warns of Israel violating Islamic, Christian sanctities in Jerusalem\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.', 'image': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1240103209-scaled-e1650461862999.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=85&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:01:12'}

This makes it vulnerable to military harassment, especially on ideological backgrounds. Such harassment can include launching rockets or missiles and stationing on hills near the borders, and we are here talking about Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran itself, and perhaps the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nAt the same time, Israel has a big problem, where it suffers from both strategic and tactical dangers and, therefore, it is the only one that does not have a strategic backbone. This has actually been proven on the border with the Gaza Strip, which lacks any airbases, but has posed a great challenge and threat to Israel.\n\nIsraelis worry about the dangers and shortcomings that their country is suffering from, despite their alleged achievements in the 1967 war, and in targeting the Iraqi and Syrian nuclear reactors by the Israeli Air Force. The Israeli Air Force has been described as one of the best in the world, if not the best. However, it suffers from a state of stammering in some military confrontations and causes disappointment to many who believe that it should be able to provide the state with the strategic depth it is lacking.\n\nIsraeli occupation forces do not hesitate to express their inability to face the various security threats, especially at the Palestinian home front, with the increase in guerrilla attacks and the continuous protests at Al-Aqsa Mosque. This has prompted Israeli security to demand the elimination of the resistance in terms of their military and operational means. However, they ignore the real and core problems threatening Israeli national security, and preparation for the inevitably coming confrontation.\n\nREAD: Time to confront Israel's aggression with Palestinian narratives of the ongoing Nakba\n\nIsraeli calls to deal with the Palestinian resistance using the iron fist are mainly an attempt to respond to the state of panic by the Israelis. This is expressed by the hysterical discourse on television channels, which does not focus on the roots of the resistance, or learning lessons from the extended confrontations with the Palestinians throughout a century.\n\nStrategies followed by the right-wing and left-wing governments since the Oslo Accords have contributed to the deterioration of the Israeli security situation. As a result, the northern West Bank, specifically its capital, Jenin, has become a centre for coordinating armed operations and, thus, settlements adjacent to Jenin have become a preferred target for armed Palestinian organisations.\n\nThe Israeli army, in turn, abandoned protecting settlers in the various areas of the West Bank, which turned their lives into an unbearable hell. Israel is now living with constant threats in a multi-field war, and can no longer anticipate what might happen the next day.\n\nIsraeli military and security officials say that the recent failure in the face of Palestinian resistance attacks may encourage other forces, such as Iran, to launch missiles, or Hezbollah to attack the northern settlements, which would constitute a breach of the Israeli borders. This has been revealed by a number of army generals in recent interviews and talks. They continue to warn of the possibilities of a multi-front war that the Israeli army may face, which may call for evacuating the border lines, and leaving them to the enemy.\n\nInternally, the Israeli occupation expresses its fear of an increase in the security threat from Palestinians of 1948 land, especially in mixed cities and Bedouin communities in the Negev, in anticipation of an Arab and Islamic uprising. In addition, Israel invested in iron fences and manpower in land forces, tens of thousands of whom have been expelled. Perhaps scenes from the Ukrainian war show the Israeli fear of the upcoming confrontation, amid lack of appropriate preparation for it.\n\nThe security risks that the occupying power suffers from do not stop at the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Rather, there are four connected security fronts, that are all anti-occupation, which may require the occupation's security services to start gathering intelligence information and using it to predict all possible operational activities that may require deterrence. It is a difficult challenge that is facing the occupation.\n\nAt the same time, Israeli security and intelligence forces do not discriminate between Palestinians in the various locations where they are, especially when talking about any political-security discussion, because Palestinians are spread all over the four hostile fronts Israel has been facing in recent weeks.\n\nREAD: Palestine, the tragedy of endless procrastination\n\nThe first front is Palestinians of 1948 land, especially those with anti-state opinions, and the fact that they have moved from considering integration to separation, and from coexistence to radicalism. Perhaps the Beersheba and Hadera operations, which were carried out by Palestinians from the Negev and Umm Al-Fahm, mean that we are facing a failure of the idea of Israelisation, and an escalation of idea of \u200b\u200bnationalism which is different from Israeli citizenship, not to mention a religious identity that differs from Judaism.\n\nThe second front is East Jerusalem, with a population of 350 thousand, who reside in a geographical area that does not have a clear sovereign identity, because Israel opposes to the Palestinian Authority's managing the lives of Jerusalemites and, on the other hand, Israel does not treat these Palestinians, through its municipality, as citizens on an equal footing with Jews. As a result, there is a government vacuum, and a growing young generation that is angry, disaffected and unemployed and who are susceptible to Palestinian national incitement. All of this leads, from time to time, to a security escalation in Jerusalem, as we have seen in recent days near Bab Al-Amud, with a growing phenomenon of mimicry and imitation of operations, especially during Ramadan.\n\nThe third front is the Palestinians in the West Bank, and this seems to be the most problematic one for Israel, at the moment, for a number of reasons which include breaches of the wall and the success of illegal workers from Jenin in carrying out operations, in parallel with the traditional incitement in the Palestinian media against Israel. Meanwhile, Israel is hoping that it is not too late and is escalating its security forces' preventive operations within the framework of security coordination with the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe fourth front is the southern one. At the moment, the Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip seems uninterested in the security escalation but, at the same time, it is preoccupied with the reconstruction of the Strip, building its military strength, increasing its operational capabilities and creating deterrence against Israel. Nevertheless, the month of Ramadan and a series of national commemorations ongoing until mid-May, may require Israel and its security services to be more vigilant in order to restore calm to its streets and to the personal security of settlers.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.", 'image': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AA-20220409-27518273-27518267-ISRAELI_SOLDIERS_RAID_IN_WEST_BANK.jpg?resize=1199%2C800&quality=85&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:53'}

Arrest and detention or release, either way it doesn\'t really matter, because the simple truth is that Israeli state violence against Palestinians in Al-Aqsa during Ramadan is now so routine that it is taken for granted.\n\nIsraelis get away with it by describing each and every Palestinian killed, wounded or arrested as a "terrorist". A lawyer shot and killed as he dropped children off at school in Nablus this week, Mohammed Assaf, 34, was also just another "terrorist" according to one Israeli media source. His killer was an Israeli soldier who opened the door of his jeep and fired at random as it sped past; the driver didn\'t even slow down or stop. A drive-by killing with a difference: the criminal in an Israeli uniform knows that he will get away with it; that there will be no international outcry; no new "Palestinian Lives Matter" demonstrations; nothing except another funeral in a Palestinian village. Life will go on. It was just another day in occupied Palestine.\n\nAnd that is where the single, underlying cause of the violence lies: Palestine is under a brutal military occupation. We tend to forget that; at least the Western Zionist media and politicians do. To them, it\'s a "dispute" over "contested" territory. They may have short memories, but the facts are on the record for all to see.\n\nREAD: Mass protest in front of London Israel embassy\n\nThe infamous 1917 Balfour Declaration doesn\'t even mention the indigenous Palestinian population by name; it describes them as the "non-Jewish" population. Nor were the Palestinians consulted about the 1947 UN Partition Plan which split their land in two: the larger part was designated as a "Jewish state", leaving the rest as an "Arab state". Jerusalem was supposed to be an international city, not the "undivided capital" of Israel, as the latter claims and Donald Trump accepted in 2018. As I said, memories are short.\n\nAccept the very concept of the state of Israel as it was called in May 1948, and you condone the ethnic cleansing that Zionist militias and terrorist gangs conducted to drive out more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homes and land. In other words you condone the occupation of Palestine which began in 1948 and has expanded ever since with massacres, bombs, bullets and casual violence of the kind that killed Mohammed Assaf.\n\nIsrael gets away with it because it has been emboldened by the immunity granted to it by the international community. Hence, even though UN officials may condemn what Israel does, and the UN General Assembly may pass resolution after resolution pointing out, for example, the legitimacy of armed resistance to a military occupation — that\'s right, it\'s not "terrorism" — and the right of return for all refugees, but such resolutions are not binding on member states, leaving Israel free to do what it wants. If matters escalate and actually reach the UN Security Council, Israel\'s back is covered by the US veto, and the violence of the Zionist state and its settlers — all of whom are illegal — continues unabated, leading to many more "just another day in occupied Palestine" incidents.\n\nUntil and unless Israel\'s ability to act with impunity is brought to an end, this will remain the case, and many more innocent bystanders will lose their lives at the hands of trigger-happy Israeli police and troops. Remember this the next time you read about "Israeli-Palestinian clashes" and that, "The violence has sparked international fears of conflict, a year since similar unrest led to an 11-day war between Israel and militants in Gaza." If a brutal military occupation isn\'t already enough to be "conflict" enough to have "sparked international fears", then I don\'t know what is.\n\nThat sentence by Agence France-Presse in the Guardian says it all. The international community continues to overlook Israel\'s occupation and the fact that this is a nuclear-armed, belligerent state taking on a largely civilian population; continues to believe that Israel is the victim of "terrorism"; and continues to insist that only bogus "peace negotiations" and further "concessions" by the Palestinians — a euphemism for surrender — will end the cycle of violence. The international community is wrong. The only way to end the violence is to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine.\n\nIsrael\'s founding ideology, Zionism, insists that only "Greater Israel" will suffice, and that means taking ever more Palestinian land with ever fewer Palestinians on it. Successive Israeli governments don\'t want any old peace; they want peace on their terms, which means no Palestinians in the historic land of Palestine. Anyone who believes otherwise is ignoring the reality of the ongoing ethnic cleansing and has clearly bought into the Zionist narrative. Forget Passover and Ramadan, Israel\'s violence is rooted in its heart and soul; it\'s all about the brutal Israeli military occupation and colonisation of Palestine.\n\nREAD: PA warns of Israel violating Islamic, Christian sanctities in Jerusalem\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.', 'image': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1240103209-scaled-e1650461862999.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=85&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:01:12'}

This makes it vulnerable to military harassment, especially on ideological backgrounds. Such harassment can include launching rockets or missiles and stationing on hills near the borders, and we are here talking about Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran itself, and perhaps the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nAt the same time, Israel has a big problem, where it suffers from both strategic and tactical dangers and, therefore, it is the only one that does not have a strategic backbone. This has actually been proven on the border with the Gaza Strip, which lacks any airbases, but has posed a great challenge and threat to Israel.\n\nIsraelis worry about the dangers and shortcomings that their country is suffering from, despite their alleged achievements in the 1967 war, and in targeting the Iraqi and Syrian nuclear reactors by the Israeli Air Force. The Israeli Air Force has been described as one of the best in the world, if not the best. However, it suffers from a state of stammering in some military confrontations and causes disappointment to many who believe that it should be able to provide the state with the strategic depth it is lacking.\n\nIsraeli occupation forces do not hesitate to express their inability to face the various security threats, especially at the Palestinian home front, with the increase in guerrilla attacks and the continuous protests at Al-Aqsa Mosque. This has prompted Israeli security to demand the elimination of the resistance in terms of their military and operational means. However, they ignore the real and core problems threatening Israeli national security, and preparation for the inevitably coming confrontation.\n\nREAD: Time to confront Israel's aggression with Palestinian narratives of the ongoing Nakba\n\nIsraeli calls to deal with the Palestinian resistance using the iron fist are mainly an attempt to respond to the state of panic by the Israelis. This is expressed by the hysterical discourse on television channels, which does not focus on the roots of the resistance, or learning lessons from the extended confrontations with the Palestinians throughout a century.\n\nStrategies followed by the right-wing and left-wing governments since the Oslo Accords have contributed to the deterioration of the Israeli security situation. As a result, the northern West Bank, specifically its capital, Jenin, has become a centre for coordinating armed operations and, thus, settlements adjacent to Jenin have become a preferred target for armed Palestinian organisations.\n\nThe Israeli army, in turn, abandoned protecting settlers in the various areas of the West Bank, which turned their lives into an unbearable hell. Israel is now living with constant threats in a multi-field war, and can no longer anticipate what might happen the next day.\n\nIsraeli military and security officials say that the recent failure in the face of Palestinian resistance attacks may encourage other forces, such as Iran, to launch missiles, or Hezbollah to attack the northern settlements, which would constitute a breach of the Israeli borders. This has been revealed by a number of army generals in recent interviews and talks. They continue to warn of the possibilities of a multi-front war that the Israeli army may face, which may call for evacuating the border lines, and leaving them to the enemy.\n\nInternally, the Israeli occupation expresses its fear of an increase in the security threat from Palestinians of 1948 land, especially in mixed cities and Bedouin communities in the Negev, in anticipation of an Arab and Islamic uprising. In addition, Israel invested in iron fences and manpower in land forces, tens of thousands of whom have been expelled. Perhaps scenes from the Ukrainian war show the Israeli fear of the upcoming confrontation, amid lack of appropriate preparation for it.\n\nThe security risks that the occupying power suffers from do not stop at the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Rather, there are four connected security fronts, that are all anti-occupation, which may require the occupation's security services to start gathering intelligence information and using it to predict all possible operational activities that may require deterrence. It is a difficult challenge that is facing the occupation.\n\nAt the same time, Israeli security and intelligence forces do not discriminate between Palestinians in the various locations where they are, especially when talking about any political-security discussion, because Palestinians are spread all over the four hostile fronts Israel has been facing in recent weeks.\n\nREAD: Palestine, the tragedy of endless procrastination\n\nThe first front is Palestinians of 1948 land, especially those with anti-state opinions, and the fact that they have moved from considering integration to separation, and from coexistence to radicalism. Perhaps the Beersheba and Hadera operations, which were carried out by Palestinians from the Negev and Umm Al-Fahm, mean that we are facing a failure of the idea of Israelisation, and an escalation of idea of \u200b\u200bnationalism which is different from Israeli citizenship, not to mention a religious identity that differs from Judaism.\n\nThe second front is East Jerusalem, with a population of 350 thousand, who reside in a geographical area that does not have a clear sovereign identity, because Israel opposes to the Palestinian Authority's managing the lives of Jerusalemites and, on the other hand, Israel does not treat these Palestinians, through its municipality, as citizens on an equal footing with Jews. As a result, there is a government vacuum, and a growing young generation that is angry, disaffected and unemployed and who are susceptible to Palestinian national incitement. All of this leads, from time to time, to a security escalation in Jerusalem, as we have seen in recent days near Bab Al-Amud, with a growing phenomenon of mimicry and imitation of operations, especially during Ramadan.\n\nThe third front is the Palestinians in the West Bank, and this seems to be the most problematic one for Israel, at the moment, for a number of reasons which include breaches of the wall and the success of illegal workers from Jenin in carrying out operations, in parallel with the traditional incitement in the Palestinian media against Israel. Meanwhile, Israel is hoping that it is not too late and is escalating its security forces' preventive operations within the framework of security coordination with the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe fourth front is the southern one. At the moment, the Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip seems uninterested in the security escalation but, at the same time, it is preoccupied with the reconstruction of the Strip, building its military strength, increasing its operational capabilities and creating deterrence against Israel. Nevertheless, the month of Ramadan and a series of national commemorations ongoing until mid-May, may require Israel and its security services to be more vigilant in order to restore calm to its streets and to the personal security of settlers.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.", 'image': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AA-20220409-27518273-27518267-ISRAELI_SOLDIERS_RAID_IN_WEST_BANK.jpg?resize=1199%2C800&quality=85&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:53'}

In a significant development, UN human rights experts called on the international community to take immediate and effective steps to protect and sustain the six Palestinian civil society groups that were designated as ‘terrorist organizations’ by the Israeli regime in October 2021.\n\nIn a press release by the Office of the High Commissioner of the United Nations Human Right body, the UN experts dubbed the Israelis’ heinous act to designate civil society groups as terrorist organizations as a “disturbing designation.”\n\n“Israel’s disturbing designation of these organizations as ‘terrorist organizations’ has not been accompanied by any public concrete and credible evidence,” said the human rights experts. “We note that the information presented by Israel has also failed to convince a number of governments and international organizations that have traditionally provided funding for the indispensable work of these six organizations.”\n\nIn October 2021, the UN experts denounced Israel’s designation of six Palestinian civil society organizations – Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, Al-Haq, Bisan Center for Research and Development, Defense for Children International, Palestine, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees, and the Union of Palestinian Women Committees – as terrorist organizations. Israel’s designation enables it to close the organizations, seize their assets, end their work and charge their leadership and staff with terrorist offences.\n\n“Israel has had six months to substantiate its accusations and it has failed to deliver,” the experts said. “We call on the funding governments and international organizations to swiftly conclude that Israel has not established its allegations and to announce that they will continue to financially and politically support these organizations and the communities and groups they serve.”\n\nAlthough Israel has not substantiated its allegations publicly or to the funding governments and international organizations, several of the funders have delayed their contributions to the Palestinian organizations while they investigate these claims. The European Union has formally suspended its funding for two of these organizations. This has undermined the work of these Palestinian organizations and has had an incalculable impact on the communities they support.\n\nThe experts said there has been a lack of clarity about the duration of these steps.\n\n“We are deeply disturbed by Israel’s apparent misuse of anti-terrorism legislation to attack some of the leading civil society organizations in Palestine.

This did not reveal any evidence that would confirm the allegations. I have therefore decided not to take any action against the Palestinian organizations in question. Nor is the evidence provided by the Israeli authorities such as to reconsider my decision.”\n\nThe human rights experts emphasized that they recognize and applaud the indispensable work of Palestinian civil society in holding Israel accountable for its occupation and human rights violations and in promoting democratic principles and human rights within Palestinian society.\n\n“Applying anti-terrorism laws to well-regarded human rights defenders and civil society organizations – without persuasive evidence to substantiate these claims – seems to indicate a politically-motivated attempt by Israel to silence some of its most effective critics in violation of their rights to freedom of association and of expression,” they said.\n\n“If the international community is serious about its support for Palestinian self-determination and an end to the 55-year-old Israeli occupation, it must become more vocal and assertive in defending the work of these organizations, and reminding Israel of its international human rights obligations.”\n\nAccordingly, the human rights experts called upon the international community to:\n\nPublicly conclude that Israel has not substantiated its allegations against the six organizations;\n\nResume, continue and even increase its financial and political support for the work of these six organizations; and\n\nDemand that Israel retract the designations and cease its harassment of all Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights and civil society organizations which promote human rights and accountability in Israel and Palestine.\n\nCertainly, the steps taken to counter the Israeli regime’s odious crimes and designations are insufficient, but this is a good start, as the international organizations have been tight-lipped about the monstrous regime’s actions.\n\nIran, as a pioneer of resistance and resilience of the brave Palestinian fighters, have always urged the global community to take effective measures to stop the Israeli regime’s atrocities. Free-spirited people around the world have taken Iran’s call, and expressed solidarity with the Palestinians multitudes of times, unlike their arrogant governments, who prefer to have economic relations with the child-killing regime.\n\n', 'image': 'https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2022/04/26/4/4131516.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:57'}

the 14 UN independent rights experts have blamed the U.S. government for making life worse for Afghan women by blocking billions of dollars of the central bank assets made up in part of aid money for the country accumulated over decades.\n\nIn a statement, the UN-appointed human rights experts said “we are gravely concerned about the growing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, which puts at serious risk the lives of more than half of the country’s population, with a disproportionate impact on women and children.”\n\nIt said that “while gender-based violence has been a long-standing and severe threat to women and girls, it has been exacerbated by the measures imposed by the U.S., together with the drought”\n\nAnalysts say despite the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and its disastrous 20-year occupation that saw poverty levels increase, the American-led withdrawal from the country in August last year has seen Washington still harming Afghans and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis there.\n\nTo make matters worse, in February, U.S. President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order to continue blocking the funds and use half of the money for purposes within the U.S.\n\nObservers note the money belongs to the Afghan people and Washington’s collective punishment of the Afghan nation by blocking access to their money is not something new.\n\nThe White House, regardless of which party is in power, has increasingly resorted to sanctions and asset freezes of other sovereign countries in a common warfare tactic against governments who rule over independent nations around the globe that oppose Washington’s foreign policies.\n\nHowever, analysts believe this type of collective punishment by the U.S. the aim of which to try and get the population revolting against their own governments over their economic affairs will backfire on America itself and its currency the dollar.\n\nIn a statement, the UN rights experts appealed to Washington saying that humanitarian exemptions to Afghan sanctions, agreed to by the UN Security Council last December, has led to “no significant progress” in financial or commercial aid to Afghanistan, as many foreign banks were concerned about breaching restrictions.\n\nGravely concerned about the humanitarian crisis in the country, the experts added that it “puts at serious risk the lives of more than half of the country’s population”.\n\nEchoing the UN Secretary-General, who recently described it as an “epic humanitarian crisis on the verge of a development catastrophe’, the experts urged countries in particular the U.S. to re-assess any adopted unilateral measure and lift all obstacles in providing the necessary financial and humanitarian aid.\n\nIn January, the UN launched its largest-ever humanitarian appeal for a single country, requiring more than $5 billion this year to help the Afghan people.\n\nAccording to international assessments, Afghanistan has now the highest number of people in emergency food insecurity in the world, with more than 23 million in need of assistance, and approximately 95 percent of the population having insufficient food consumption.\n\nOf particular concern is the vulnerability of more than four million internally displaced, including people belonging to minorities and over 3.5 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries, the majority of whom have been provided refugee by authorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nFurthermore, the experts highlighted that since the December adoption of Security Council resolution 2651 and the establishment of humanitarian exemptions to existing sanctions, there hasn’t been any progress in financial or commercial flows for development and humanitarian purposes to Afghanistan by States or international financial institutions.\n\nThe group said “since the adoption, in December 2021, of the UN Security Council resolution 2651 and the establishment of humanitarian exemptions to the existing sanctions regime, mentioned in our last statement, there has been, unfortunately, no significant progress in the financial and commercial flows by States and international financial institutions for development and humanitarian purposes in Afghanistan. Humanitarian actors face serious operational challenges due to the uncertainty caused by banks' zero-risk policies and over-compliance with sanctions.”\n\nThe uncertainty caused by banks’ zero-risk policies and over-compliance with sanctions has left humanitarian actors facing serious operational challenges.\n\nAccording to the experts, the U.S. Executive Order may “exacerbate the climate of uncertainty among relevant actors...resulting in over-zealous compliance with sanctions,” thus preventing Afghans from “access to basic humanitarian goods”.\n\nThe UN experts called on the U.S. to seriously consider the growing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and reconsider its position towards the plight of Afghans living in poverty; recalling that countries have an obligation under international human rights law to guarantee that activity under their jurisdiction does not result in human rights violations.\n\nThey say “such overly broad formulations may exacerbate the climate of uncertainty among relevant actors, including banks, businesses, and humanitarian donors, resulting in over-zealous compliance with sanctions thus preventing people of Afghanistan from any access to basic humanitarian goods.”\n\nThey also called U.S. authorities to take all appropriate action to reverse its unilateral measure toward Kabul and contribute to the international effort in addressing the growing humanitarian crisis in the country.\n\nThe experts called on the U.S. to take the matter “into serious consideration”\n\nThey added, “we recall that States have an obligation under international human rights law to guarantee that any activity under their jurisdiction or control does not result in human rights violations, and in this regard, we urge the U.S. authorities to take all appropriate action, in line with its international human rights obligations, to reverse this unilateral measure and to decisively contribute to the international efforts in addressing the growing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.”\n\nThe 14 special rapporteurs and independent experts are appointed by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council to examine and report back on a specific human rights theme or a country's situation. They are independent of any government and are not paid for their work.\n\nThey have sent their observations and warning to the U.S. administration saying “prior to the issuance of this press release, we communicated our concerns and recommendations to the U.S. Government, which has, to this day, much to our regret, not responded.”\n\nHowever, analysts say they are not surprised by Washington’s silence and the lack of empathy it is displaying despite the mounting evidence of a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nCritics argue that is very concerning when Washington has further evidence now from independent experts about how it’s sanctions is worsening the dire humanitarian crisis.\n\nThis is a crisis that was created by the U.S. itself, yet the Biden administration chooses not to take any action to address America’s responsibility for wreaking havoc in Afghanistan with its 20-year occupation.\n\nMeanwhile, others say the war in Ukraine has overshadowed the dire humanitarian problems in countries like Afghanistan and Yemen where the U.S. played a direct role in the crises.", 'image': 'https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2022/04/26/4/4131434.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:58'}

In a significant development, UN human rights experts called on the international community to take immediate and effective steps to protect and sustain the six Palestinian civil society groups that were designated as ‘terrorist organizations’ by the Israeli regime in October 2021.\n\nIn a press release by the Office of the High Commissioner of the United Nations Human Right body, the UN experts dubbed the Israelis’ heinous act to designate civil society groups as terrorist organizations as a “disturbing designation.”\n\n“Israel’s disturbing designation of these organizations as ‘terrorist organizations’ has not been accompanied by any public concrete and credible evidence,” said the human rights experts. “We note that the information presented by Israel has also failed to convince a number of governments and international organizations that have traditionally provided funding for the indispensable work of these six organizations.”\n\nIn October 2021, the UN experts denounced Israel’s designation of six Palestinian civil society organizations – Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, Al-Haq, Bisan Center for Research and Development, Defense for Children International, Palestine, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees, and the Union of Palestinian Women Committees – as terrorist organizations. Israel’s designation enables it to close the organizations, seize their assets, end their work and charge their leadership and staff with terrorist offences.\n\n“Israel has had six months to substantiate its accusations and it has failed to deliver,” the experts said. “We call on the funding governments and international organizations to swiftly conclude that Israel has not established its allegations and to announce that they will continue to financially and politically support these organizations and the communities and groups they serve.”\n\nAlthough Israel has not substantiated its allegations publicly or to the funding governments and international organizations, several of the funders have delayed their contributions to the Palestinian organizations while they investigate these claims. The European Union has formally suspended its funding for two of these organizations. This has undermined the work of these Palestinian organizations and has had an incalculable impact on the communities they support.\n\nThe experts said there has been a lack of clarity about the duration of these steps.\n\n“We are deeply disturbed by Israel’s apparent misuse of anti-terrorism legislation to attack some of the leading civil society organizations in Palestine. Such misuse must be rejected and countered,” the experts said.\n\n“The United Nations has been very clear that the drafting and application of anti-terrorism laws have to be rigorously consistent with international law and human rights protections, including the principles of legal certainty, necessity, proportionality, the rule of law and non-discrimination.”\n\nAgainst this background, the experts welcomed the statement issued on March 23, 2022 by the Belgian Minister of Development Cooperation, Meryame Kitir, who stated, “My administration has conducted an internal investigation into the allegations. This did not reveal any evidence that would confirm the allegations. I have therefore decided not to take any action against the Palestinian organizations in question. Nor is the evidence provided by the Israeli authorities such as to reconsider my decision.”\n\nThe human rights experts emphasized that they recognize and applaud the indispensable work of Palestinian civil society in holding Israel accountable for its occupation and human rights violations and in promoting democratic principles and human rights within Palestinian society.\n\n“Applying anti-terrorism laws to well-regarded human rights defenders and civil society organizations – without persuasive evidence to substantiate these claims – seems to indicate a politically-motivated attempt by Israel to silence some of its most effective critics in violation of their rights to freedom of association and of expression,” they said.\n\n“If the international community is serious about its support for Palestinian self-determination and an end to the 55-year-old Israeli occupation, it must become more vocal and assertive in defending the work of these organizations, and reminding Israel of its international human rights obligations.”\n\nAccordingly, the human rights experts called upon the international community to:\n\nPublicly conclude that Israel has not substantiated its allegations against the six organizations;\n\nResume, continue and even increase its financial and political support for the work of these six organizations; and\n\nDemand that Israel retract the designations and cease its harassment of all Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights and civil society organizations which promote human rights and accountability in Israel and Palestine.\n\nCertainly, the steps taken to counter the Israeli regime’s odious crimes and designations are insufficient, but this is a good start, as the international organizations have been tight-lipped about the monstrous regime’s actions.\n\nIran, as a pioneer of resistance and resilience of the brave Palestinian fighters, have always urged the global community to take effective measures to stop the Israeli regime’s atrocities. Free-spirited people around the world have taken Iran’s call, and expressed solidarity with the Palestinians multitudes of times, unlike their arrogant governments, who prefer to have economic relations with the child-killing regime.\n\n', 'image': 'https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2022/04/26/4/4131516.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:57'}

the 14 UN independent rights experts have blamed the U.S. government for making life worse for Afghan women by blocking billions of dollars of the central bank assets made up in part of aid money for the country accumulated over decades.\n\nIn a statement, the UN-appointed human rights experts said “we are gravely concerned about the growing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, which puts at serious risk the lives of more than half of the country’s population, with a disproportionate impact on women and children.”\n\nIt said that “while gender-based violence has been a long-standing and severe threat to women and girls, it has been exacerbated by the measures imposed by the U.S., together with the drought”\n\nAnalysts say despite the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and its disastrous 20-year occupation that saw poverty levels increase, the American-led withdrawal from the country in August last year has seen Washington still harming Afghans and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis there.\n\nTo make matters worse, in February, U.S. President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order to continue blocking the funds and use half of the money for purposes within the U.S.\n\nObservers note the money belongs to the Afghan people and Washington’s collective punishment of the Afghan nation by blocking access to their money is not something new.\n\nThe White House, regardless of which party is in power, has increasingly resorted to sanctions and asset freezes of other sovereign countries in a common warfare tactic against governments who rule over independent nations around the globe that oppose Washington’s foreign policies.\n\nHowever, analysts believe this type of collective punishment by the U.S. the aim of which to try and get the population revolting against their own governments over their economic affairs will backfire on America itself and its currency the dollar.\n\nIn a statement, the UN rights experts appealed to Washington saying that humanitarian exemptions to Afghan sanctions, agreed to by the UN Security Council last December, has led to “no significant progress” in financial or commercial aid to Afghanistan, as many foreign banks were concerned about breaching restrictions.\n\nGravely concerned about the humanitarian crisis in the country, the experts added that it “puts at serious risk the lives of more than half of the country’s population”.\n\nEchoing the UN Secretary-General, who recently described it as an “epic humanitarian crisis on the verge of a development catastrophe’, the experts urged countries in particular the U.S. to re-assess any adopted unilateral measure and lift all obstacles in providing the necessary financial and humanitarian aid.\n\nIn January, the UN launched its largest-ever humanitarian appeal for a single country, requiring more than $5 billion this year to help the Afghan people.\n\nAccording to international assessments, Afghanistan has now the highest number of people in emergency food insecurity in the world, with more than 23 million in need of assistance, and approximately 95 percent of the population having insufficient food consumption.\n\nOf particular concern is the vulnerability of more than four million internally displaced, including people belonging to minorities and over 3.5 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries, the majority of whom have been provided refugee by authorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nFurthermore, the experts highlighted that since the December adoption of Security Council resolution 2651 and the establishment of humanitarian exemptions to existing sanctions, there hasn’t been any progress in financial or commercial flows for development and humanitarian purposes to Afghanistan by States or international financial institutions.\n\nThe group said “since the adoption, in December 2021, of the UN Security Council resolution 2651 and the establishment of humanitarian exemptions to the existing sanctions regime, mentioned in our last statement, there has been, unfortunately, no significant progress in the financial and commercial flows by States and international financial institutions for development and humanitarian purposes in Afghanistan. Humanitarian actors face serious operational challenges due to the uncertainty caused by banks' zero-risk policies and over-compliance with sanctions.”\n\nThe uncertainty caused by banks’ zero-risk policies and over-compliance with sanctions has left humanitarian actors facing serious operational challenges.\n\nAccording to the experts, the U.S. Executive Order may “exacerbate the climate of uncertainty among relevant actors...resulting in over-zealous compliance with sanctions,” thus preventing Afghans from “access to basic humanitarian goods”.\n\nThe UN experts called on the U.S. to seriously consider the growing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and reconsider its position towards the plight of Afghans living in poverty; recalling that countries have an obligation under international human rights law to guarantee that activity under their jurisdiction does not result in human rights violations.\n\nThey say “such overly broad formulations may exacerbate the climate of uncertainty among relevant actors, including banks, businesses, and humanitarian donors, resulting in over-zealous compliance with sanctions thus preventing people of Afghanistan from any access to basic humanitarian goods.”\n\nThey also called U.S. authorities to take all appropriate action to reverse its unilateral measure toward Kabul and contribute to the international effort in addressing the growing humanitarian crisis in the country.\n\nThe experts called on the U.S. to take the matter “into serious consideration”\n\nThey added, “we recall that States have an obligation under international human rights law to guarantee that any activity under their jurisdiction or control does not result in human rights violations, and in this regard, we urge the U.S. authorities to take all appropriate action, in line with its international human rights obligations, to reverse this unilateral measure and to decisively contribute to the international efforts in addressing the growing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.”\n\nThe 14 special rapporteurs and independent experts are appointed by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council to examine and report back on a specific human rights theme or a country's situation. They are independent of any government and are not paid for their work.\n\nThey have sent their observations and warning to the U.S. administration saying “prior to the issuance of this press release, we communicated our concerns and recommendations to the U.S. Government, which has, to this day, much to our regret, not responded.”\n\nHowever, analysts say they are not surprised by Washington’s silence and the lack of empathy it is displaying despite the mounting evidence of a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nCritics argue that is very concerning when Washington has further evidence now from independent experts about how it’s sanctions is worsening the dire humanitarian crisis.\n\nThis is a crisis that was created by the U.S. itself, yet the Biden administration chooses not to take any action to address America’s responsibility for wreaking havoc in Afghanistan with its 20-year occupation.\n\nMeanwhile, others say the war in Ukraine has overshadowed the dire humanitarian problems in countries like Afghanistan and Yemen where the U.S. played a direct role in the crises.", 'image': 'https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2022/04/26/4/4131434.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:58'}

Arrest and detention or release, either way it doesn\'t really matter, because the simple truth is that Israeli state violence against Palestinians in Al-Aqsa during Ramadan is now so routine that it is taken for granted.\n\nIsraelis get away with it by describing each and every Palestinian killed, wounded or arrested as a "terrorist". A lawyer shot and killed as he dropped children off at school in Nablus this week, Mohammed Assaf, 34, was also just another "terrorist" according to one Israeli media source. His killer was an Israeli soldier who opened the door of his jeep and fired at random as it sped past; the driver didn\'t even slow down or stop. A drive-by killing with a difference: the criminal in an Israeli uniform knows that he will get away with it; that there will be no international outcry; no new "Palestinian Lives Matter" demonstrations; nothing except another funeral in a Palestinian village. Life will go on. It was just another day in occupied Palestine.\n\nAnd that is where the single, underlying cause of the violence lies: Palestine is under a brutal military occupation. We tend to forget that; at least the Western Zionist media and politicians do. To them, it\'s a "dispute" over "contested" territory. They may have short memories, but the facts are on the record for all to see.\n\nREAD: Mass protest in front of London Israel embassy\n\nThe infamous 1917 Balfour Declaration doesn\'t even mention the indigenous Palestinian population by name; it describes them as the "non-Jewish" population. Nor were the Palestinians consulted about the 1947 UN Partition Plan which split their land in two: the larger part was designated as a "Jewish state", leaving the rest as an "Arab state". Jerusalem was supposed to be an international city, not the "undivided capital" of Israel, as the latter claims and Donald Trump accepted in 2018. As I said, memories are short.\n\nAccept the very concept of the state of Israel as it was called in May 1948, and you condone the ethnic cleansing that Zionist militias and terrorist gangs conducted to drive out more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homes and land. In other words you condone the occupation of Palestine which began in 1948 and has expanded ever since with massacres, bombs, bullets and casual violence of the kind that killed Mohammed Assaf.\n\nIsrael gets away with it because it has been emboldened by the immunity granted to it by the international community. Hence, even though UN officials may condemn what Israel does, and the UN General Assembly may pass resolution after resolution pointing out, for example, the legitimacy of armed resistance to a military occupation — that\'s right, it\'s not "terrorism" — and the right of return for all refugees, but such resolutions are not binding on member states, leaving Israel free to do what it wants. If matters escalate and actually reach the UN Security Council, Israel\'s back is covered by the US veto, and the violence of the Zionist state and its settlers — all of whom are illegal — continues unabated, leading to many more "just another day in occupied Palestine" incidents.\n\nUntil and unless Israel\'s ability to act with impunity is brought to an end, this will remain the case, and many more innocent bystanders will lose their lives at the hands of trigger-happy Israeli police and troops. Remember this the next time you read about "Israeli-Palestinian clashes" and that, "The violence has sparked international fears of conflict, a year since similar unrest led to an 11-day war between Israel and militants in Gaza." If a brutal military occupation isn\'t already enough to be "conflict" enough to have "sparked international fears", then I don\'t know what is.\n\nThat sentence by Agence France-Presse in the Guardian says it all. The international community continues to overlook Israel\'s occupation and the fact that this is a nuclear-armed, belligerent state taking on a largely civilian population; continues to believe that Israel is the victim of "terrorism"; and continues to insist that only bogus "peace negotiations" and further "concessions" by the Palestinians — a euphemism for surrender — will end the cycle of violence. The international community is wrong. The only way to end the violence is to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine.\n\nIsrael\'s founding ideology, Zionism, insists that only "Greater Israel" will suffice, and that means taking ever more Palestinian land with ever fewer Palestinians on it. Successive Israeli governments don\'t want any old peace; they want peace on their terms, which means no Palestinians in the historic land of Palestine. Anyone who believes otherwise is ignoring the reality of the ongoing ethnic cleansing and has clearly bought into the Zionist narrative. Forget Passover and Ramadan, Israel\'s violence is rooted in its heart and soul; it\'s all about the brutal Israeli military occupation and colonisation of Palestine.\n\nREAD: PA warns of Israel violating Islamic, Christian sanctities in Jerusalem\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.', 'image': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1240103209-scaled-e1650461862999.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=85&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:01:12'}

This makes it vulnerable to military harassment, especially on ideological backgrounds. Such harassment can include launching rockets or missiles and stationing on hills near the borders, and we are here talking about Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran itself, and perhaps the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nAt the same time, Israel has a big problem, where it suffers from both strategic and tactical dangers and, therefore, it is the only one that does not have a strategic backbone. This has actually been proven on the border with the Gaza Strip, which lacks any airbases, but has posed a great challenge and threat to Israel.\n\nIsraelis worry about the dangers and shortcomings that their country is suffering from, despite their alleged achievements in the 1967 war, and in targeting the Iraqi and Syrian nuclear reactors by the Israeli Air Force. The Israeli Air Force has been described as one of the best in the world, if not the best. However, it suffers from a state of stammering in some military confrontations and causes disappointment to many who believe that it should be able to provide the state with the strategic depth it is lacking.\n\nIsraeli occupation forces do not hesitate to express their inability to face the various security threats, especially at the Palestinian home front, with the increase in guerrilla attacks and the continuous protests at Al-Aqsa Mosque. This has prompted Israeli security to demand the elimination of the resistance in terms of their military and operational means. However, they ignore the real and core problems threatening Israeli national security, and preparation for the inevitably coming confrontation.\n\nREAD: Time to confront Israel's aggression with Palestinian narratives of the ongoing Nakba\n\nIsraeli calls to deal with the Palestinian resistance using the iron fist are mainly an attempt to respond to the state of panic by the Israelis. This is expressed by the hysterical discourse on television channels, which does not focus on the roots of the resistance, or learning lessons from the extended confrontations with the Palestinians throughout a century.\n\nStrategies followed by the right-wing and left-wing governments since the Oslo Accords have contributed to the deterioration of the Israeli security situation. As a result, the northern West Bank, specifically its capital, Jenin, has become a centre for coordinating armed operations and, thus, settlements adjacent to Jenin have become a preferred target for armed Palestinian organisations.\n\nThe Israeli army, in turn, abandoned protecting settlers in the various areas of the West Bank, which turned their lives into an unbearable hell. Israel is now living with constant threats in a multi-field war, and can no longer anticipate what might happen the next day.\n\nIsraeli military and security officials say that the recent failure in the face of Palestinian resistance attacks may encourage other forces, such as Iran, to launch missiles, or Hezbollah to attack the northern settlements, which would constitute a breach of the Israeli borders. This has been revealed by a number of army generals in recent interviews and talks. They continue to warn of the possibilities of a multi-front war that the Israeli army may face, which may call for evacuating the border lines, and leaving them to the enemy.\n\nInternally, the Israeli occupation expresses its fear of an increase in the security threat from Palestinians of 1948 land, especially in mixed cities and Bedouin communities in the Negev, in anticipation of an Arab and Islamic uprising. In addition, Israel invested in iron fences and manpower in land forces, tens of thousands of whom have been expelled. Perhaps scenes from the Ukrainian war show the Israeli fear of the upcoming confrontation, amid lack of appropriate preparation for it.\n\nThe security risks that the occupying power suffers from do not stop at the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Rather, there are four connected security fronts, that are all anti-occupation, which may require the occupation's security services to start gathering intelligence information and using it to predict all possible operational activities that may require deterrence. It is a difficult challenge that is facing the occupation.\n\nAt the same time, Israeli security and intelligence forces do not discriminate between Palestinians in the various locations where they are, especially when talking about any political-security discussion, because Palestinians are spread all over the four hostile fronts Israel has been facing in recent weeks.\n\nREAD: Palestine, the tragedy of endless procrastination\n\nThe first front is Palestinians of 1948 land, especially those with anti-state opinions, and the fact that they have moved from considering integration to separation, and from coexistence to radicalism. Perhaps the Beersheba and Hadera operations, which were carried out by Palestinians from the Negev and Umm Al-Fahm, mean that we are facing a failure of the idea of Israelisation, and an escalation of idea of \u200b\u200bnationalism which is different from Israeli citizenship, not to mention a religious identity that differs from Judaism.\n\nThe second front is East Jerusalem, with a population of 350 thousand, who reside in a geographical area that does not have a clear sovereign identity, because Israel opposes to the Palestinian Authority's managing the lives of Jerusalemites and, on the other hand, Israel does not treat these Palestinians, through its municipality, as citizens on an equal footing with Jews. As a result, there is a government vacuum, and a growing young generation that is angry, disaffected and unemployed and who are susceptible to Palestinian national incitement. All of this leads, from time to time, to a security escalation in Jerusalem, as we have seen in recent days near Bab Al-Amud, with a growing phenomenon of mimicry and imitation of operations, especially during Ramadan.\n\nThe third front is the Palestinians in the West Bank, and this seems to be the most problematic one for Israel, at the moment, for a number of reasons which include breaches of the wall and the success of illegal workers from Jenin in carrying out operations, in parallel with the traditional incitement in the Palestinian media against Israel. Meanwhile, Israel is hoping that it is not too late and is escalating its security forces' preventive operations within the framework of security coordination with the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe fourth front is the southern one. At the moment, the Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip seems uninterested in the security escalation but, at the same time, it is preoccupied with the reconstruction of the Strip, building its military strength, increasing its operational capabilities and creating deterrence against Israel. Nevertheless, the month of Ramadan and a series of national commemorations ongoing until mid-May, may require Israel and its security services to be more vigilant in order to restore calm to its streets and to the personal security of settlers.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.", 'image': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AA-20220409-27518273-27518267-ISRAELI_SOLDIERS_RAID_IN_WEST_BANK.jpg?resize=1199%2C800&quality=85&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:53'}

After a land operation on the Qandil mountains to destroy PKK hideouts, they retreated.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the operations intensified due to increased PKK attacks and infiltration attempts near border towns that cost hundreds of Turkish soldiers' lives.\n\nIn May 1995, the Turkish army launched Operation Steel with the participation of 35,000 personnel. The operation was followed by Operation Claw, which was launched on May 27, 2019, to entirely eliminate the presence of the terrorist organization in northern Iraq.\n\nBefore launching Operation Claw-Lock, Turkish officials informed Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) officials about the plans.

Some 23 among them were detained in operations in 16 provinces, while a manhunt is underway to capture the others. Wanted and captured suspects include three noncommissioned officers from the Land Forces Command, noncommissioned officers expelled from the Air Forces Command on suspicion of links to FETÖ and former military cadets.\n\nSuspects were identified through a string of evidence against them, including their contacts with fellow FETÖ members through public payphones, a common method employed by the secretive group, and confessions of FETÖ members arrested in earlier operations. Payphones have proven to be the terrorist group\'s undoing since the coup attempt was quashed. Focusing their probe on payphones in busy places, investigators managed to identify a large number of "imams" who phoned the infiltrators to arrange secret meetings.\n\nFETÖ is still active in Turkey years after the coup attempt, in which it employed its military infiltrators. But it faces more exposure nowadays, thanks to an increasing number of members collaborating with authorities to shed light on its secretive network. In the capital Ankara alone, 1,244 people out of the 4,724 detained for links to the terrorist group collaborated with investigators last year. Their confessions, in exchange for a lenient sentence in terrorism cases against them, helped authorities to uncover nearly 20,000 FETÖ suspects previously unknown to the authorities. FETÖ members captured in operations in the years before the coup attempt were less willing to collaborate with authorities, the figures show. But this changed after the coup attempt, where several members of the group had confessed that they have seen “the true face” of the group for the first time. FETÖ, even after two coup attempts in late 2013, managed to keep its followers it exploited under the guise of a charity movement with religious undertones. Collaborators, however, draw the wrath of prominent members of the group who have fled Turkey before and after the 2016 coup attempt, and who can be deciphered on social media. Emre Uslu, a fugitive FETÖ member who currently resides in the United States, where FETÖ leader Fetullah Gülen also lives, had recently uncovered the identity of a former FETÖ member who collaborated with authorities on social media. Uslu had sought to incite fellow FETÖ members against the collaborator, “now living in Cologne, Germany.”\n\nIn the northwestern province of Edirne, security forces captured three FETÖ suspects who were trying to illegally cross the border into Greece.

Nearly two weeks later, on April 5, three Iranian clerics were stabbed by an Afghan extremist at the holy shrine of Imam Reza in Mashhad two of them lost their lives due to severe injuries. On April 23, the convoy of the commander of the IRGC Special Forces in Zahedan came under attack which resulted in the death of the commander’s bodyguard.\n\nMeanwhile, in Afghanistan, which is a stone’s throw from the location of the forgoing incidents, a wave of explosions killed and injured dozens of Shiite and Sunni civilians. Six terrorist attacks hit Afghanistan in a period of four days.\n\nIran sensed danger early and warned about plots to instigate a sectarian war in Afghanistan and direct it to Iran. The Iranian Foreign Minister was quick to denounce the attacks in Afghanistan and reminded the Taliban of its responsibility toward maintaining peace and security.\n\nIn light of the recurrence of numerous explosions in different cities of Afghanistan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh expressed Iran’s concern about these tragic events. He referred to the blind terrorist acts that took place during the holy month of Ramadan, which coincides with the presence of more people in mosques, describing the targeting of fasting worshipers as a repulsive act.\n\nShiite and Sunni mosques were equally targeted by bomb explosions in Afghanistan, something that deeply concerned Iran. Following an explosion at the Mawlawi Sekandar mosque for Sunni Muslims, Khatibzadeh pointed to a series of terrorist attacks in Afghanistan over the past days and described the escalation of violence as a source of deep concern.\n\n“The attack on the Sunni mosque in Kunduz Province, which followed yesterday’s attack on the Shia mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, clearly shows the evil goals of the terrorists serving as mercenaries for foreigners, who are seeking to create a civil war in Afghanistan,” he added.\n\nAlso, Iranian President Ayatollah Seyed Ebrahim Raisi used his capacity as the head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council to warn about threats against the people of Afghanistan and neighboring countries.\n\n“Following the recurrence of criminal terrorist explosions in schools and mosques in different parts of Afghanistan, which have resulted in the martyrdom and injury of a significant number of Afghans, the President sent a message and warned about the spread of threats against the Afghan people and nations in the region,” the official website of the Iranian presidency said in a statement, adding, “The President of the Supreme National Security Council also stressed the responsibility of the Afghan rulers in identifying and punishing the terrorists responsible for the recent attacks, and said that the Islamic Republic of Iran is ready to cooperate and use all its means to counter the threat of Takfiri terrorism and prevent recurrence of these tragedies.”\n\nIran is exercising restraint on Afghanistan and has extended a helping hand to the battle-scarred country, but in the last month there have been several dangerous incidents, each of which has the potential to provoke misunderstanding.\n\n“The situation in Afghanistan, including all ethnic and religious groups, has been important to the Islamic Republic of Iran since day one, and the Afghan government's definite responsibility to all ethnicities and groups has been reminded,” Khatibzadeh said in a Monday presser. “We do not have a minority in Afghanistan, we have tribes that all share the present and the future of Afghanistan.”\n\nUnderlining the Taliban’s definite responsibility to ensure the security of all ethnic groups in Afghanistan, Khatibzadeh said, “The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets that [Afghanistan’s] governing body has not yet been able to establish the necessary security in some areas.”\n\n", 'image': 'https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2022/04/25/4/4130462.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:00:57'}

Why does this matter?\n\nFrom the very beginning of his campaigning, Joe Biden pledged to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), otherwise known as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\n\nHowever, he delayed the talks for two months with the excuse of deciding on his political delegation. Later, he assigned Antony Blinken to “revive” the deal. In this regard, Blinken put Robert Malley, former head of the Crisis Group, a think tank that claims to be “an independent, non-profit, non-governmental organization committed to preventing and resolving deadly conflict,” according to its website.\n\nThe appointment of Malley as the chief negotiator of the United States raised skepticism over the very foundation of the JCPOA revival. The logic behind his appointment was that one of the masterminds behind the JCPOA text would be a perfect choice for the revival of the said text. Yet, over the course of eight intensive rounds of negotiations, Malley turned into an entirely different person.\n\nBeing one of the minds behind the JCPOA text, one would normally expect Malley to adhere and believe in what he has written, and what has become an internationally recognized agreement. However, this diplomat began his tactics step by step by throwing stones in the way of a fruitful negotiation. How? By making excessive, maximalist demands, some of which were entirely out of the JCPOA context.\n\nBaffled by internal conflicts within the administration, Joe Biden’s cabinet has failed to determine a perfect strategy to resuscitate the nuclear deal. Case in point is the new round of talks between the U.S. and the Israeli regime which is set to begin in the current week. This was clear in the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman’s remarks to the Tehran Times on Monday.\n\n“The Biden government has held talks with the regime, which has been trying to damage all diplomatic opportunities since day one, and this is not the first time that the Islamic Republic of Iran has witnessed such talks between the United States and the occupation regime in Jerusalem. We will continue our peaceful nuclear path regardless of any media hypes,” he told the Tehran Times correspondent during his weekly presser.\n\nLet’s explore why these talks are multitudes of steps back from the previously claimed “constructive approach” of the U.S. in the Vienna talks.\n\nThe meetings will take place in the midst of a major deadlock in indirect negotiations between the United States and Iran to resurrect the nuclear accord.\n\nAccording to the Axios report, “The Biden administration has recently started discussing a scenario in which the nuclear deal isn’t revived. Israel is pressing the administration to cooperate on a ‘Plan B’ in case that happens.”\n\nBiden and Bennett held a phone call on Sunday and discussed shared regional and global security challenges, including the threat posed by Iran, the White House reported.\n\nBennett and Biden mentioned Iran's demand that the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) be removed from the United States' list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs), according to the Israeli Prime Minister's office.\n\n“I am sure that President Biden, who is a true friend of Israel and cares about its security, will not allow the IRGC to be removed from the list of terrorist organizations,” Bennett said in a statement after the call.\n\n“Israel has clarified its position on the issue: The IRGC is the largest terrorist organization in the world.”\n\nWhile the Iranian officials repeatedly underline that removing the IRGC from the FTO list is a must, and an agreement cannot be reached in Vienna without removing the IRGC from the said list, Washington keeps moving in the wrong direction by including a terrorist regime in what is discussed in the negotiation rooms in Palais Coburg, Vienna.\n\nIn an interview on March 28, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian stated that one of the outstanding issues in the Vienna nuclear talks is the unilateral sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States, specifically under Donald Trump's presidency after he left the nuclear deal.\n\nAccording to Amir Abdollahian, the IRGC is “the most important security and defense” organization in Iran, and Iran has told the Americans, likely through the EU coordinator that serves as an intermediary, its concern with the IRGC-related sanctions.\n\nWhen the Biden administration knows that the IRGC sanctions are a red line for Tehran, conducting talks with Iran’s arch-enemy in the midst of a make-or-break negotiation could heavily jeopardize the fate of the negotiations as a whole.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry officials have time and again underscored that Tehran will not back down from its red lines. Though the de-listing of IRGC is one of the stalemates in the Vienna talks, it is not all. There are more stalemates that need to be addressed by the White House, and it is crucial not to undermine the remaining issues in Vienna to just one difference of opinion.\n\nIn another part of his press briefing, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Khatibzadeh said that reducing the remaining issues in the Vienna talks to just one issue is the Israelis’ demand.\n\n“Reducing what is left between us and the United States to one issue is the demand of Washington and the Zionist regime. Our topics cannot be reduced or simplified,” the spokesman said.\n\nHe added that what is going on between Iran and the United States is a confrontation of two perspectives.\n\n“One ignores a view of international law and tries to impose its policy on all international issues, and the other one is the perspective of the Islamic Republic, which believes that the signed negotiations which have been sealed and set aside, should be respected,” Khatibzadeh elaborated.\n\nHe then stressed that U.S. elections and domestic politics could not determine the outcome of the Vienna talks.\n\n“The sanctions imposed by Trump must be lifted and Iran's economic benefits must be fully considered.

We condemn the Greek archbishop\'s statement on Easter, which reflects the hatred of the Greek Cypriot Orthodox Church toward the Turkish Cypriot people and Turkey from past to present."\n\nThe statement emphasized that the Greek Orthodox Church was one of the chief culprits behind the atrocities endured by the Turkish Cypriot people for years.\n\nIt was also stated that the archdiocese, which has used its power to influence the Greek political elite in the past and present, left the Turkish Cypriot people to live amid the threat of death and genocide in ghettos that make up only 3% of the island in 1963-1974.\n\nThe ministry underlined that the Greek archbishop does not view the implications of the "Enosis" obsession to expand the Greek state as a source of shame.\n\nIt was underlined that the archbishop did not hide that he views the island as Hellenic property, noting that it came as no surprise that an institution that had been the flag bearer of the Enosis movement declared the island Greek and the Turkish Cypriots a minority.\n\n"If Turkey had not intervened in the island in 1974 following the coup carried out by Greece and the declared Enosis, the genocide would have continued until there was not a single Turkish Cypriot left on the island with the dream of connecting the island to Greece. The 1974 Peace Operation, which took place as a result of the rights arising from the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee and the calls of the Turkish Cypriot people, has no similarity with the situation in Ukraine in legal and moral terms.\n\n"Today, there are two peoples living side by side in two separate states on the island. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is the only state that has the right to have a say in the future of the lands under its sovereignty, including the region of Varosha (Maraş). The only way that will take the two sides forward on the island is through the cooperation of the two states on the island on the basis of good neighborly relations," added the TRNC Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe Enosis movement started by various Greek communities living outside the country seeks to incorporate regions they inhabit into the Greek state. Enosis is related to the "Megali Idea," an irredentist concept of a Greek state that dominated Greek politics following the creation of modern Greece in 1830. A widely known example of Enosis is the Greek Cypriot movement for a union of the island with Greece. The concept in British-ruled Cyprus became associated with the campaign for self-determination, especially among the island\'s Greek Cypriots. Around then, intercommunal violence occurred in response to different objectives, and the continuing desire for Enosis resulted in the 1974 Greek Cypriot coup in an attempt to achieve it. It, however, prompted Turkey into launching an operation, which led to partition.\n\nThe island of Cyprus has been mired in a decadeslong dispute between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, despite a series of diplomatic efforts by the United Nations to achieve a comprehensive settlement.\n\nEthnic attacks starting in the early 1960s forced Turkish Cypriots to withdraw into enclaves for their safety.\n\nIn 1974, a Greek Cypriot coup aiming at Greece\'s annexation led to Turkey\'s military intervention as a guarantor power to protect Turkish Cypriots from persecution and violence.\n\nThe TRNC was founded in 1983.

Whether you’re looking to expand your company’s presence or launch your brand for the first time, if you have a contract in-hand, it has never been a better time to enter and invest in the Saudi market,” he added.\n\nThe new law will grant foreign investors the freedom to manage, sell, and dispose of their economic projects and own any necessary properties, ensuring smoother business operations. It will give both local and foreign investors the full support of all competent government authorities and will ensure that both are subject to the same sectoral approval requirements for registration, licenses, and approvals for permits needed for specific economic activities or zones.\n\nRead more:\n\nSaudi finance minister says int’l cooperation needed for global economic recovery\n\nSaudi Arabia aiming for tenfold increase in air transit traffic by 2030\n\nSaudi Arabia safely welcomes 14 million visitors to Prophet’s Mosque during Ramadan', 'image': 'https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2022/04/25/b40bdc27-1452-492b-960c-cc953090d92f/b40bdc27-1452-492b-960c-cc953090d92f_16x9_600x338.PNG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:01:06'}

إدارة الحرب الجوية. فإذا كانت هذه هي الإجراءات والمعلومات الاستخباراتية التي استندت إليها غارة جوية خُطِّط لها بعناية وخضعت للتدقيق على أعلى المستويات، فكيف يكون الوضع مع المعلومات الاستخباراتية في عشرات الآلاف من الغارات الأخرى التي نُفّذ أغلبها على نحو أسرع من ذلك؟ بدأتُ في تقديم طلبات للحصول على تقارير تقييم المصداقية لآلاف الغارات الأخرى التي قيل إنها تسببت في مقتل مدنيين.\n\n”كنا نحن الضحيّة“\n\nبينما كنت أنتظر البتّ في تلك الطلبات، عدتُ مرةً أخرى إلى العراق. كان رازو وعائلته يعيشون في الجزء الشرقي من الموصل. في مطلع عام 2018، عدتُ للتحقيق في غارات الجزء الغربي من المدينة. أردتُ تفقّد المدينة القديمة غرب الموصل مثلما فعلتُ في شرق المدينة. كانت خطتي أن أتنقل من باب إلى آخر أتحدث مع السكان وأوثق كل منطقة أعثر عليها من المناطق المتأثرة بالغارات، لكني لم أجد أبواباً أطرقها في المدينة القديمة. فأغلب المنطقة أصبح أنقاضاً. ولإفساح الطريق أمام السيارات، استعان السكان بمعدات ثقيلة لرفع الأنقاض وحطام المنازل بل وبعض أشلاء القتلى ووضعها على جانبي الطريق.\n\nوبالقرب من جامع النوري الكبير، صادفتُ مقبرةً مؤقتة. فمع احتدام الحرب، اضطرت العائلات لدفن ذويها بسرعة في هذا المكان وتمييز القبور باستخدام الصخور أملاً في العودة إليهم ودفنهم دفناً لائقاً عندما تهدأ الأوضاع. تجمّع عدد من الرجال، فسألتُهم عن الثمن الذي دفعوه للتحرر من داعش. تقدّم أحدهم، ويُدعى مُضَر عبد القادر، ليشاركني رأيه. عاش مُضَر حياته بالكامل في الموصل وكان ناقماً على ما حدث في مسقط رأسه. قال لي: ”كنا نحن الضحيّة. دفعنا الثمن بأجسادنا“.\n\nوكما هو الحال مع عبد القادر، رفض كثير من السكان الذين التقيتُهم في تلك الجهة من المدينة أن يسمّوا ما حدث تحريراً، فهم يرون أن الحكومة في بغداد وشركاءها الأمريكيين اتخذوا قراراً متعمّداً بمعاقبة الموصل وسكانها. ودليلهم على ذلك أنه في كل هجوم كبير ضد داعش، من الرمادي إلى الفلوجة، كانت قوات التحالف تترك للمقاتلين فرصة الانسحاب، وهو ما يسهّل عملية التمييز بين المدنيين والمقاتلين. ولذا، عندما حاصرت قوات التحالف مواقع داعش غرب الموصل عام 2017، ظنّ الجميع أن هذا ما سيحدث، لكنهم كانوا مخطئين. هذه المرة، لم يكن هناك مهرب ولا ممر للوصول إلى سوريا. إنها نهاية الطريق. أحاطت القوات العراقية والميليشيات بالموصل وأغلقت جميع المخارج وحاصرت المدنيين مع المقاتلين وهم يخوضون آخر معاركهم. ولمّا وجد مقاتلو داعش أنفسهم أمام قوة جوية مهولة وهزيمة مؤكدة، احتجزوا أعداداً كبيرة من الرهائن المدنيين. وعندما انهمرت قذائف التحالف وقنابله، أخذت تحصد الأرواح بلا تمييز.\n\nانتشرت الأنباء بأن الغارات التي شنتها قوات التحالف لطرد داعش من المدينة قد أسفرت عن سقوط قتلى من المدنيين. أراد عبد القادر أن يُريني آثار الدمار الناجم عن إحدى هذه الغارات حيث دمّرت منزل طارق خليل إبراهيم سنجاري وعائلته في شهر أبريل عام 2017. لم يكن المنزل يبعد سوى أمتار قليلة، لكننا استغرقنا 30 دقيقة نتسلق الأنقاض حتى وصلنا إلى موقع الانفجار. كان الحطام يحيط بالمنزل على ارتفاع كبير حتى بدا وكأننا نطلّ على سرداب.\n\nوعلى مدار الشهور القليلة التالية، أجريتُ عدة مقابلات مع السكان الذين عاشوا في هذا البيت وفي المنطقة، ومن خلال هذه المقابلات تكوّنت لديّ صورة مبدئية عما حدث. فقد استأجرت عائلة سنجاري هذا المنزل بعد أن دُمّر منزلهم في الحرب. وفي ليلة الغارة، كان هناك 27 شخصاً نائمين في خمس غرف بالمنزل. بعد الساعة 12:30 صباحاً بقليل، استيقظ الابن عماد طارق خليل إبراهيم عاجزاً عن التنفس وأدرك أن جزءاً من جسده مدفون تحت الحجارة. وبعد أن تمكن من إزاحتها بعيداً، عثر على زوجته وابنيه، ثم سمع صوتاً فبدأ يبحث عن ناجين آخرين. كان النصف السفلي من جسد شقيقه محمود طارق خليل عالقاً أسفل كتلة خرسانية وقضبان فولاذية. قال عماد بنبرة هادئة: ”لا يمكنني أن أصف أصوات أنينه. أخذت أعانقه وأقبّل جبهته. قلت له: ‘لا تقلق، ستكونُ بخير. سوف ننقذك.’ لكنه لم يقل شيئاً. كان يتأوه فحسب“.\n\nجاء الجيران للمساعدة وقضوا أكثر من ثلاث ساعات يحاولون إخراج محمود والآخرين، لكن الكتلة الخرسانية كانت ثقيلة لا تتزحزح من مكانها. شعر عماد بتباطؤ نبض محمود وانخفاض حرارة جسمه، ففهم ما يحدث. قبّل شقيقه ودعا له ثم غادر الغرفة.\n\nاستخدم الجيران مطرقة حَفر وأداة لقطع المعادن ورافعة سيارة وظلوا حتى الساعة الواحدة ظهراً يحاولون إنقاذ الناجين وانتشال الجثث. بعدها توجهوا إلى دفن القتلى البالغ عددهم سبعة. عندما تحدثتُ مع عماد بعد مرور عام على الغارة، لم يكن يستوعب ما حدث. أخبرني أن الأسرة سمعت أزيز الطائرات فوق رؤوسهم لمدة ”24 ساعة في اليوم“. فما الذي كانت تفعله هذه الطائرات إذا لم تكن ترسل المعلومات عن وجود عشرات المدنيين في المنزل؟ قال إن مقاتلي داعش احتلوا المنزل المجاور لمنزلهم فترة قصيرة، لكنهم غادروه قبل الغارة بثلاثة أو أربعة أسابيع. يبدو أن ذلك المنزل لم يُصب في الغارة.\n\nقال عماد: ”أكثر ما يهمّني الآن أن أساعد في ألا يتكرر ما حدث لأسرتي مع شخص آخر. هل يمكنكِ كشف الحقيقة عن سبب استهداف هذا المنزل“.\n\n”تحليل ما بعد الغارة“\n\nكان الكشف عن الحقيقة مهمة شبه مستعصية من دون الوثائق. وبحلول شهر يونيو عام 2018، رفضت القيادة المركزية تسريع الإجراءات لجميع الطلبات التي تقدمتُ بها. وعليه رفعتُ دعوى قضائية بمساعدة محامين من ”لجنة مراسلين من أجل حرية الصحافة“ (RCFP). وفي بداية شهر أكتوبر، استلمتُ أول دفعة من التقارير من بينها وثائق حول 35 غارة في العراق خلُص تقييم البنتاغون لها إلى أنها أسفرت عن سقوط قتلى بين صفوف المدنيين.\n\nطبعتُ أكثر من 300 صفحة من هذه التقارير وبدأت أضع عليها الأسئلة التي سأوجهها للمصادر العسكرية. كانت التقييمات تعجّ باختصارات ولغة الجيش، وازداد غموضها بسبب الحجب المتكرر للمعلومات. لكن مثلما حدث مع الوثيقة الأولى التي حصلتُ عليها حول الغارة على منزل باسم رازو، تضمنت هذه الوثائق الكثير من المعلومات التي تكشف عن طبيعة الحرب الجوية الأمريكية.\n\nفي أحد التقييمات المقلقة بشكل خاص، وجدتُ تسجيلاً لمحادثة بين أفراد الجيش أثناء تنفيذهم إحدى الغارات في الموصل. كانوا يتحدثون عن الغارة وكأنهم يشاركون في لعبة فيديو. قال أحدهم إن المنطقة تعجُّ بالأهداف، ومع انتهاء المحادثة أدركوا أنهم ربما رأوا أطفالاً. وهناك تقرير آخر عن غارة قرّر المسؤولون عن تنفيذها إطلاق قذائف أكبر بكثير من حجم الهدف حتى يحتفظوا بالقذائف الأصغر للاستخدام لاحقاً. وقد أدى الانفجار الناجم عن الضربة إلى تدمير سيارتين مدنيتين إلى جانب سيارة داعش المستهدفة.\n\nزادت الصورة وضوحاً لا سيما عند قراءة هذه الوثائق جنباً إلى جنب مع التحقيق الميداني المستقل الذي غاب عن تقييمات المصداقية. فبينما كنت أتصفح الوثائق، لاحظتُ أن جميع التحقيقات تخلو من أي مقابلات كالتي أجريها مع المدنيين. وأقربُ ما وجدتُه لتلك المقابلات كان وصفاً في إحدى الوثائق لمقابلة أجرتها قوات العمليات الخاصة مع مدنيين فرّوا قبل فترة قصيرة من منطقة تسيطر عليها داعش. كان واضحاً أن الغرض من طرح الأسئلة على المدنيين هو تحديد الأهداف المحتملة لداعش لشن هجوم عليها، وليس جمع المعلومات حول الضحايا المدنيين. رغم ذلك، واغتناماً لهذه الفرصة، تحدّث سكان المخيم عن الغارة الجوية التي تسببت في مقتل جيرانهم.\n\nربما يفسر هذا التباين بين الوثائق والواقع على الأرض انخفاض أعداد الضحايا المدنيين التي أقرتها القيادة المركزية عن الأعداد التي وثقتُها. وأحد الأمثلة على ذلك ما كشفته زيارتي إلى قرية التوخار السورية أواخر عام 2018، وهو المكان الذي قيل إنه شهد أكبر واقعة لسقوط ضحايا مدنيين في الحرب. زعم البنتاغون أن الغارة على قرية التوخار عام 2016 تسببت في مقتل 24 مدنياً، لكن بعض التقديرات تشير إلى ما يزيد عن 200 مدني، وهو ما يجعل حصيلة القتلى الناجمة عن غارة التوخار أكبر من حصيلة القتلى في أي غارة أخرى شنتها قوات التحالف أثناء الحرب.\n\nقضيتُ شهوراً أحاول إقناع الحكومة التركية بمنحي تصريحاً لعبور الحدود حتى أتمكن من الذهاب إلى قرية التوخار في سوريا. وبعد الحصول على التصريح، غادرنا ”غازي عنتاب“ وعبرنا الحدود إلى سوريا ثم انطلقنا بالسيارة جنوباً حتى وصلنا إلى التوخار في الظهيرة. تذكَّر كل من تحدثنا معهم الواقعة. قالوا إنه مع احتدام القتال بين قوات سوريا الديموقراطية وتنظيم داعش، توجه نحو 200 شخص ممن يعيشون بالقرب من خط القتال إلى أطراف القرية واحتموا داخل أربعة منازل في مكان بعيد عن القتال، حيث اعتقدوا أنهم بمأمن في هذا المكان الذي لم تقترب منه قوات داعش.\n\nلكن في يوم التاسع عشر من يوليو، شنّت قوات التحالف سلسلة من الغارات على المنطقة. كتبتُ أسماء الأشخاص الذين لقوا حتفهم في المنازل الأربعة، وتأكدتُ من صحة التفاصيل من خلال المعلومات المتاحة علناً والصحفيين المحليين وغيرهم. ووفقاً للعدد الذي رصدتُه في مقابلاتي مع الناجين، والذي تحققتُ منه على مدار الأشهر التالية، لقي أكثر من 120 شخصاً مصرعهم في غارة التوخار. وكشفت مقابلاتي مع الناجين عن تفاصيل مروعة، إذ أصيب العشرات بإصابات مسببة للعجز. أخبرني بعض الناجين أن الكثير من سكان القرية قُتلوا في تلك الليلة لدرجة أنه لم يكن هناك عدد كاف من الشباب لاستخراج الجثامين من بين الأنقاض. استغرق استخراج الجثامين نحو أسبوعين، ولم يُعثر على بعض القتلى قط.\n\nعندما عدتُ إلى ”غازي عنتاب“ تلك الليلة وتفقدتُ بريدي الإلكتروني، وجدتُ تقييم المصداقية بشأن غارة التوخار بانتظاري. ورغم إجراء تحقيق كامل حول الواقعة، لم تصلني سوى صفحة واحدة إلى جانب صفحة الغلاف التي تضم المعلومات الأساسية. كانت إحدى فرق العمليات الخاصة – عرفتُ لاحقاً من مصدر آخر أنها ”فرقة العمل 9“ – قد دعت إلى تنفيذ غارة سريعة في شمال سوريا، حيث تلقى أفراد الفرقة أنباءً تفيد بأن مقاتلي داعش يتنقلون في مناطق ”خالية من المدنيين“، فاستنتجوا أن المقاتلين يحشدون لهجوم مضاد على قوات سوريا الديموقراطية. دمرت ”فرقة العمل 9“ ثلاث ”مناطق حشد“ وخمس سيارات. كانوا واثقين أن الغارة أودت بحياة 85 مقاتلاً من داعش، لكن فريق التقييم توصل لاحقاً إلى أن نحو 7 إلى 24 مدنياً ”ربما اختلطوا“ بمقاتلي داعش. وبعد عامين عندما وصلتني صفحات أخرى حُجب أغلبها من نفس التقرير، علمتُ أن الأساس الذي استند إليه هذ الحُكم هو ”تحليل ما بعد الغارة“ و ”تقارير مصدرها قوات سوريا الديموقراطية“.\n\nوبسبب هذا التباين بين ما رأيتُه في قرية التوخار وما قرأتُه في التقرير الرسمي للبنتاغون، أدركتُ أنه ينبغي عليّ أن أتعامل بشك مع الوثائق التي أجمعها وأن أستكملها بالتغطية الميدانية قدر المستطاع. وخلال رحلاتي إلى العراق وسوريا وأفغانستان، تقدمتُ بطلبات للحصول على المزيد من التقييمات بينما أحلل الوثائق التي تصلني باستمرار كل شهرين تقريباً. ورغم أني كنت أستطيع نشر هذه الوثائق أثناء انتظار غيرها، فإن تحرّي الإنصاف فرض عليّ أن أتفقد عدداً أكبر من الغارات على أرض الواقع. فالوثيقة العسكرية وحدها تجعلك ترى الصورة كما رآها الجيش من الجو، وقد تعلّمت من تحقيقي في الحرب الجوية الأمريكية على مدار سنوات أنه من الخطر الاكتفاء بهذه الصورة.\n\n”إنّا لله وإنّا إليه راجعون“\n\nمع انتشار الجائحة في ربيع عام 2020، اضطررت إلى وقف التحقيق الذي أجريه في العراق، وقضيت تلك الفترة في تجميع وتحليل الوثائق التي حصلت عليها. استعنتُ بباحثَين مساعدَين هما ليلى حسن وجيف باروت، طلابي السابقين في مادة تغطية النزاعات في كلية كولومبيا للصحافة، وذلك لمساعدتي في بناء قاعدة البيانات. ومعاً وضعنا خطة لاستئناف التحقيقات فور رفع القيود المفروضة على السفر. في ذلك الوقت، كنت أفهم التقييمات التي أقرؤها فهماً أفضل وكان لديّ الكثير من الوثائق. تقدّمتُ بطلبات أخرى بموجب قانون حرية المعلومات، وكانت هذه الطلبات تتحرك في المسار الإجرائي المعتاد. بدأتُ أتلقى آلاف الصفحات من الوثائق، بوتيرة تفوق قدرة أي شخص على التعامل معها.\n\nوبنهاية عام 2020، تلقيتُ معلومة جديدة ستفيد تحقيقاتي في الميدان. فبعد سنوات من المفاوضات، زوّد الجيش الأمريكي أخيراً مجموعة Airwars، وهي منظمة بريطانية غير ربحية، بالإحداثيات العسكرية لمواقع الغارات التي أقرّ بسقوط ضحايا مدنيين فيها. فحتى ذلك الحين، كان من الصعب أن أحدد بدقة مكان غارة مذكورة في البيانات الصحفية للبنتاغون أو في تقييمات المصداقية. عادةً ما تشير تلك البيانات إلى وقوع غارة ”قرب الموصل“ وهي معلومة لا فائدة منها. وحتى بعد أن بدأتُ استلام الوثائق، كان الموقع الدقيق للغارة محجوباً دائماً، وهو ما حدث أيضاً مع معظم الخرائط أو الصور التي يمكن أن تساعدني في تحديد الموقع. والآن بفضل مجموعة Airwars، أصبح لديّ الإحداثيات التي يُفترض أنها دقيقة في نطاق 100 متر. بهذه البيانات، يمكنني أن أذهب إلى مكان أعلم أنه شهد حدوث غارة جوية وأبدأ بطرح الأسئلة.\n\nفي الوقت الذي تلقيتُ فيه الجرعة الثانية من لقاح كوفيد، كنتُ قد وضعتُ منهجية لتنفيذ ذلك. فقبل زيارة أي موقع من المواقع التي أكّد الجيش مقتل المدنيين فيها، كنت أحلّل الوثائق لمعرفة التفاصيل الأساسية عن الادعاء، مثل المعلومات الاستخباراتية، والاستنتاج الذي خلُص إليه الجيش، وكيف تمت الموافقة على الضربة، وما الذي رصده الفيديو، والمحادثات والتقارير، وتقديرات الضحايا وغيرها. بعدها، أبحث عن الإحداثيات التي كشف عنها الجيش، وأحلل الموقع باستخدام صور الأقمار الصناعية قبل تاريخ الغارة وبعدها، لأرصد أي مناطق متأثرة وأحدد ما إذا كان هناك شيء يتطابق مع وصف الهدف في الوثيقة، أو إذا كانت الإحداثيات غير دقيقة.\n\nقررتُ أن أبدأ بالموصل. أردتُ أن أفحص عدداً كبيراً من المواقع وهو ما سيستغرق وقتاً طويلاً. كنتُ قد كونتُ شبكة علاقات في المدينة تجعلني أعمل هناك بأمان لعدة شهور. ولأستعدّ لزيارتي، استعنتُ بطالبين من قسم الترجمة في جامعة الموصل هما مؤمن مهند وزينب الفخري ودرّبتهما على الأدوات الأساسية للصحافة الاستقصائية.\n\nتشير السجلات إلى أن هناك 90 واقعة تأكّد فيها سقوط ضحايا مدنيين في الموصل والمناطق المحيطة بها. كنتُ قد زرتُ بعض هذه المناطق من قبل، لكني لم أزر الكثير منها بعد. بدأنا بدراسة كل منطقة من مناطق الغارات باستخدام أدوات رسم الخرائط المعتمدة على المصادر الجماعية المحلية حتى نتمكن من فهم المنطقة وبنيتها التحتية فهماً أفضل. كما تحققنا من المعلومات المتداولة علناً عن الواقعة، كالمصادر التي وثقتها مجموعة Airwars، وأجرينا بحثنا الخاص للوصول إلى مواد أخرى مثل مقاطع الفيديو الدعائية التي كانت تبثها داعش لتوثيق الوضع عقب الانفجار. (اعتُبرت مقاطع الفيديو التي تبثها داعش موثوقة إلى حد كبير في رصدها لأعداد الضحايا المدنيين، حتى من قبل المجموعات المعارضة لداعش). حققنا كذلك في مقاطع الفيديو التي سجلتها قوات التحالف للتفجيرات للبحث عن أي تطابق محتمل. واستخدمنا موقع الأرشيف الرقمي ”Wayback Machine“ ومواقع أرشفة رقمية أخرى للبحث عن أي مواد لم تعد متاحة في مكان آخر على الإنترنت. وضعتُ كل تلك المواد التي جمّعتها في تطبيق إلكتروني لأتمكن من الوصول إليها عن طريق هاتفي أثناء وجودي في الميدان.\n\nوفي مطلع شهر مايو وصلتُ إلى الموصل وبدأتُ زيارة مواقع الغارات مع مؤمن وأحد خبراء الأمن المحليين. وعلى مدار الشهرين التاليين، تحققت من 50 موقعاً هناك. كنا نبدأ كل مرة بإحداثيات الموقع الرسمية المعلنة من الجيش – حتى وإن دلّ مضمون الوثيقة أو تحليل الصور على احتمالية خطأ هذه الإحداثيات. في بعض الحالات، كنت أستنتج أن الإحداثيات غير دقيقة، لكني كنت أصل إلى الموقع الفعلي للغارة اعتماداً على التفاصيل الأخرى في الوثيقة أو من خلال البحث الميداني. ومن بين 50 موقعاً زرتها في الموصل، استطعتُ تأكيد تفاصيل الواقعة وتحديد الناجين أو شهود العيان في 27 موقعاً.\n\nعند الوصول إلى مكان الإحداثيات، كنت أحاول البحث عن الموقع الذي استهدفته الغارة. كنت أقدّم نفسي للأشخاص القريبين من المكان وأسألهم إذا كانت لديهم أي معلومات عما حدث، وهو ما يتوقف على ما إذا كانوا قد عاشوا في المنطقة خلال الفترة الزمنية المذكورة. أدركتُ أن ما يخبرني به الناس قد لا يكون صحيحاً، إما لأن الأحداث التبست عليهم أو لأنهم لا يقولون الحقيقة، ولذلك بذلت قصارى جهدي لأتفادى المعلومات الخاطئة. وقد فعلتُ ذلك بطرق شتّى. فرغم أني أصل إلى المكان ولديّ صورة واضحة عما حدث وفقاً لرواية الجيش، كنت أحتفظ بتلك الصورة لنفسي وأحاول جاهدةً ألا أطرح أسئلةً توحي بالجواب. كنت أيضاً ألتمس وجهات النظر المختلفة من شهود العيان. لم أكن أصرّح بخبر الزيارة قبل موعدها، حتى لا يرتّب أحد للمقابلات أو يتفقّد المكان قبل الزيارة. في بعض الأحيان، كنت أجد الكثير من المعلومات التي أدلى بها شهود عيان في مواد علنية المصدر فأطلع عليها مسبقاً، لكني حرصتُ على عدم التواصل مع أي شخص عبر فيسبوك أو تويتر قبل وصولي للموقع لأن ذلك قد يتسبب في لفت الأنظار للزيارة وربما التحيز في العمل. كان التلاعب بالأدلة ومواءمة الروايات أمراً وارداً، لذلك فإن مقابلة الناس دون سابق تخطيط سيضمن حصولي على شهادات بالغة المصداقية.\n\nكان وقت وصولي للموقع يختلف باختلاف المنطقة. فإذا كان سكان المنطقة من الطبقة العاملة، يمكنني الذهاب في الصباح والعثور على أشخاص هنا وهناك. أما في المناطق السكنية الأكثر ثراءً، تكون الشوارع خالية من المارة ولا يستجيب أحد لقرع أجراس البيوت. كان أصحاب المحلات والعمال يتذكرون بسهولة التفاصيل الأساسية، لكن دون تذكر التواريخ المحددة للواقعة. كنتُ أحدد النطاق الزمني بحسب الأحداث المعروفة – على سبيل المثال ”عيد الأضحى عام 2017“، أو ”قبل تحرير هذه المنطقة بأسبوعين“، أو ”عقب تدمير داعش لقبر النبي يونس“. وبعد تكوين فكرة عما حدث، أبدأ بتضييق نطاق الاحتمالات. حرصتُ أيضاً على عدم طرح أسئلة محددة وأن أترك التفاصيل تتأكد بشكل تلقائي. على سبيل المثال، بدلاً من أن أسأل: ”هل قُتل هنا رجل كان يدفع عربة“.، كنت أتساءل عن المبنى المجاور وهل تأثر بالانفجار أم لا.\n\nفي بعض الأحيان، كان الأشخاص الذين أحاورهم يصفون بدقة التفاصيل التي ذكر التقرير أن المحللين رصدوها في الفيديو – وهي تفاصيل لم تظهر قط على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي. على سبيل المثال، تذكّر رجل في الموصل مشهداً محدداً للغاية حين سقط صاروخ في الجهة المقابلة في الشارع لكنه أخطأ في إصابة شخص من داعش كان جالساً على كرسي متحرك، فأعقبه صاروخ ثان أصابه مباشرةً وهو يحاول أن يلوذ بالفرار، وأصاب أطفالاً كانوا يركضون خارج منازلهم. لم أكن قد سألته عن الكرسي المتحرك، لكن روايته الدقيقة شجعتني أن أطلب منه الجلوس للحديث عن المزيد عن الواقعة.\n\nلم تكن الموافقة على إجراء الحوار قاصرةً على سؤال الأشخاص عما إذا كانت لديهم الرغبة في إجراء هذا الحوار أو اقتباس كلامهم أم لا، بل كنت أشرح لهم أغراضي من البحث وأخبرهم بالتحديد أين يمكن أن تُنشر كلماتهم أو وجوههم أو أصواتهم. أخبرتهم عن هدفي بأن أُطلع الشعب الأمريكي على تبعات الحروب الأمريكية. وافق الكثيرون منهم على المساعدة، فكانوا يدعونني على الفور إلى بيوتهم حيث يمكن أن تستمر اللقاءات معهم عدة ساعات. كنت أعطي الأولوية لمن هم على معرفة مباشرة بالواقعة مثل شهود العيان أو أفراد العائلة. لكنهم لم يرغبوا بالحديث أحياناً. كانوا يقولون إن النسيان أفضل وتلك مشيئة الله، وكثيراً ما سمعتهم يرددون: ”إنا لله وإنا إليه راجعون“.\n\nسأل بعض الناجين عن التعويضات التي يدفعها الجيش الأمريكي للضحايا وعما إذا كان حديثهم معي سيجدي نفعاً. كنت أوضح لهم بشكل قاطع قبل اللقاءات أني صحافية فحسب ولا أعمل في مجال الإغاثة ولا أمثل أي منظمة غير حكومية. أوضحت لهم أني لا أستطيع الدفاع عنهم، لكن يمكنني نشر رواياتهم وأن أضيف بيانات الاتصال بهم – إذا أرادوا – في مراسلاتي مع الجيش الأمريكي. فعلى حد علمي لم يتصل أي مسؤول عن تقييم الضحايا المدنيين بهم قط.\n\n”جسم ثقيل مجهول الهوية“\n\nبعد أسبوعين من وصولي إلى العراق، قادتني الإحداثيات إلى تقاطع في حي الزنجيلي في الموصل. وبحسب الوثائق، رصد المسؤولون العسكريون في هذا المكان عام 2017 مقاتلين من داعش يطلقون طائرات مراقبة مسيّرة صغيرة من فوق مبنى منخفض. لم ير المسؤولون مدنيين أو أشخاصاً يسيرون في الشارع قبل إطلاق القذيفة، لكن قبل لحظة القصف مباشرةً ”شوهد مدنيّان قادمان من شارع مجاور نحو منطقة الخطر“ كما شوهدت ”شاحنة صغيرة“ تتحرك باتجاه الهدف.\n\nخلُص التقييم إلى مقتل اثنين من المشاة، لكنه لم يشر إلى أي ضحايا آخرين من المدنيين. عندما وصلتُ إلى حي الزنجيلي، سألتُ بعض الأشخاص الواقفين بجوار أحد الجدران إذا كانوا يعرفون شيئاً عن أي غارات جوية وقعت في هذه المنطقة. أشاروا إلى المبنى المقابل لنا وقالوا إن مقاتلي داعش طردوا إحدى العائلات واحتلوا منزلاً من طابقين من المنازل الثلاثة هناك. وعلى مدار ثلاثة أيام، كانوا يأتون إلى المنزل ويطلقون الطائرات المسيّرة كأنها حمامٌ زاجل. انبهر الأطفال بتلك الأجهزة الصغيرة فكانوا يتجمعون لمشاهدتها وهي تحلق في السماء. وفي اليوم الثالث، قُصف المبنى.\n\nأصيب أحد هؤلاء الأشخاص، ويُدعى ماهر محمود، جراء الانفجار. أخبرني أنه كان يسير بجوار المنزل في طريقه لرؤية صديق يبيع السجائر في الخفاء عندما سقطت القذيفة. كان الانفجار كبيراً، وشعر ماهر بشظية تخترق رأسه من الخلف، لكنه أدرك أن انفجاراً ثانياً سيحدث، لذا ركض إلى طريق قريب واختبأ تحت شاحنة صغيرة. كان الانفجار الثاني أكبر بكثير من الأول. في رأيه، لو أن شخصاً نجا من الانفجار الأول، فمن المستحيل أن يكون قد نجا من الثاني.\n\nومع استمراري في طرح الأسئلة، وجدت الكثير من الأشخاص ممن لديهم تفاصيل يودّون مشاركتها عما حدث في تلك الغارة. ذكروا لي أسماء القتلى والمصابين، وبعضهم خلع ملابسه ليريني إصابته. تجمّع الأهالي حول جهاز الكمبيوتر الخاص بي في غرفة الضيوف في أحد المنازل، وشاهدنا الفيديو الذي أعدّه تنظيم داعش عن الدمار الناجم عن القصف – وهو فيديو لم يُذكر قط في تقييم الجيش الأمريكي – وطلبت المساعدة في تأكيد هوية جميع الأشخاص الذين ظهروا فيه. كانت المشاهد مروعة؛ أطفال يحملون حقائب الظهر، وجثث يصعب التعرف عليها، وفتاة صغيرة مذعورة ذات عينين بنّيتين واسعتين في المستشفى. أخبرني أحدهم أن الفتاة اسمها أسيل وأن والدها قُتل في الهجوم وأصيبت ساقها، وأنها تعيش الآن مع أمّها في حي الهرمات في ضواحي المدينة.\n\nعندما وصلنا إلى المنزل، وجدنا عدداً كبيراً من الأطفال في الخارج. كان المنزل مطلياً من الداخل باللون الوردي. تبدو أسيل الآن أكبر عمراً؛ خجولة لكنها تبتسم. أذنت لنا الأم بتصوير الندبة الغائرة في ساقها اليسرى. أخبرتني أنها وجدت نفسها بعد الغارة

The leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) was sworn in as the 23rd prime minister of the country. His new cabinet draws heavily from the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and to a small extent from the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-F. Hina Rabbani Khar is the new Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and it is likely that Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will be Foreign Minister.\n\nThese changes will have an impact on Pakistan's foreign policy, and we can expect careful recalibration in ties with the Gulf countries. During his maiden speech, Sharif mentioned some important countries, which included all Gulf Cooperation Council members, the leaders and officials of which were quick with their congratulatory messages.\n\nThe Sharif family has long-held ties with Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia. When former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (the new prime minister's elder brother) was deposed by the then Army Chief of Staff Pervez Musharraf in 2000, the Sharif family went into exile in the Kingdom. It has significant assets and investments in both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. However, after Nawaz Sharif returned to power in 2013, there was a rift with the GCC when his government refused to send Pakistani troops to join the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen since 2015. The UAE was particularly vocal in its criticism, which prompted Pakistan to shift towards building ties with Turkey and Qatar. Nevertheless, Shehbaz Sharif's first official overseas trip as prime minister will be to Riyadh on 27 April.\n\nImran Khan's government was initially welcomed by all stakeholders in the Gulf, with visits to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. He established a good rapport with Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman in Riyadh, which resulted in Pakistan getting crucial financial support to stabilise the economy. Bin Salman's subsequent visit to Islamabad in 2019 concluded with the announcement of investment projects worth $20 billion.\n\nREAD: Will Khan's ousting be Pakistan's Mosaddegh moment?\n\nRelations with the UAE were also restored somewhat when Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Zayed became the first Emirati leader to visit Pakistan for more than a decade. With Iran, too, there were notable developments; the opening of border markets, for example, aimed at increased economic engagement. During the course of his premiership, Khan also developed cordial ties with Turkey and Qatar. On the economic front, Egypt sent its first business delegation to Islamabad which resulted in a $2 billion investment in a housing estate by billionaire Naguib Sawiris.\n\nHowever, despite this promising start, Khan was unable to maintain the momentum. One factor was his leaning towards Iran, much to Saudi and UAE annoyance. Moreover, the Saudis were visibly perturbed at his attempts to form an alliance with Malaysia, Turkey and Iran as an alternative to the Jeddah-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In 2019, Imran Khan cancelled his scheduled attendance at the Kuala Lumpur Summit after pressure was applied by Riyadh. Furthermore, the Gulf countries were not happy with Khan's criticism of their silence about Indian and Israeli atrocities in Kashmir and Palestine respectively. In 2020, when former Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi called out the OIC for dragging its feet on the Kashmir issue, the Saudis responded by demanding early repayment by Pakistan of a $3 billion loan. Islamabad repaid $1bn after borrowing it from Beijing.\n\nWith Shehbaz Sharif at the helm, there is likely to be some recalibration towards replicating the previous friendly ties. He has taken office at a time when the country is suffering from major financial deficits. Even though the International Monetary Fund yesterday extended the bailout programme for Pakistan by a year and increased the loan from $6 billion to $8 billion, the situation is deteriorating fast. Pakistan is in desperate need of boosting its foreign exchange reserves which can only cover imports for two months at most. It also needs to manage rising fuel costs.\n\nREAD: Erdogan congratulates new Pakistan PM, dropping ousted Imran Khan\n\nThe GCC is home to a large Pakistani diaspora, so its significance cannot be underestimated. Remittances from expat workers account for nearly 86 per cent of the secondary income balance of the Pakistani economy; nearly 60 per cent of these remittances are from Gulf countries. Furthermore, these states are vital for meeting Pakistan's energy needs. It depends on the UAE and Saudi Arabia for oil imports, and on Qatar for Liquid Natural Gas. Hence, the new premier is expected to channel his efforts towards developing close relationships with the GCC and get much needed aid, as well as an upgrade for the existing oil credit facility provided by the Kingdom.\n\nIn addition, Sharif's focus will be on accelerating the completion of the projects under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), particularly the development of its Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Like the previous government, he will likely seek to attract Gulf investment for CPEC projects, specifically those related to food and energy security. Moreover, in 2021 it was said that a masterplan for an oil city which would include a $10 billion Aramco oil facility was underway. While nothing came of it, the project is likely to be taken up by the new government.\n\nIn terms of relations with Iran, Prime Minister Sharif seems to be engaging with cautious neutrality. Under no circumstances can Iran be discounted, primarily because of its geographical congruity with Pakistan and the situation in neighbouring Afghanistan. He is likely to pursue the completion of the 2,775 km Iran-Pakistan pipeline. In 2011, Iran announced that it had completed its part of the $7.5 billion project. Pakistani officials attribute the delay in completion to US pressure as well as financial constraints. The non-completion of the pipeline has caused an element of distrust between Islamabad and Tehran, which Sharif will need to address without delay. He has already invited Iranian President Sayyid Ebrahim Raisi to visit Islamabad while voicing his intentions to strengthen ties between the two neighbours.\n\nPakistan's relations with Turkey are likely to keep the focus on economic cooperation, rather than Khan's Islamic focus.\n\nWith regards to defence ties, despite the current political disorder, military ties with Gulf partners are expected to grow. As evidenced from last year alone, Pakistan engaged with several joint military exercises (both on land and sea) with Gulf nations. Moreover, Pakistani defence equipment exports are also continuing to grow. An example is the Pakistan-Turkey warship deal worth $1.5 billion in May 2021 which to date is the biggest single military export contract of Turkey.\n\nIt is a fact that Imran Khan is dynamic and charismatic, whereas Shehbaz Sharif's reputation as a workaholic dynamo precedes him. He knows that the length of his government's term in office depends upon his performance in the lead up to elections next year.\n\nWhile there is broad goodwill for the new government, the end result will be determined by what foreign policy trajectory Islamabad adopts and how it is reciprocated. However, economics is the mainstay in international relations, especially in a world which is yet to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Pakistan for one is anticipating a turbulent landing.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.", 'image': 'https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Shehbaz-Sharif.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=85&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:01:09'}

The Pakistani parliament ousted Khan in a rare no-confidence vote earlier this month, paving the way for a new cast of political leaders.\n\nPakistan’s lawmakers elected on April 11 Shehbaz Sharif as the country's new prime minister after ousting Imran Khan. The cricket star-turned-politician vehemently opposed the vote and even sought to dissolve the parliament but his efforts got nowhere. Imran Khan and most of his party members resigned their national assembly seats before the vote.\n\nThe resignation of Imran Khan's allies facilitated the rise of Sharif as he was the only candidate for the top executive job after Khan loyalist Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the former foreign minister, withdrew his candidacy.\n\nSharif is the leader of the centrist Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N). He is a businessman and has served as former chief minister of Pakistan's most populous Punjab province.\n\nImran Khan has blamed the United States for his ouster, saying that Washington led a plot to unseat him after he visited Moscow against U.S. advice.\n\nPakistan’s National Security Council, a body of top civil and military leaders, has rejected Khan’s accusations that Washington had conspired to overthrow his government through a parliamentary vote of confidence.\n\nAsad Majeed, the former Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. who had written a cable to Islamabad about Washington’s take on Khan’s Moscow visit, briefed the civil and military leaders on a forum called National Security Committee (NSC), according to Al Jazeera.\n\n“The NSC after reviewing the contents of the communication, the assessment received, and the conclusion presented by the security agencies, concludes that there has been no conspiracy,” a statement from the office of new Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who chaired the NSC meeting, said on Friday.\n\nAside from how Imran Khan was ousted, Pakistan is facing a litany of economic challenges that could tempt other countries to use to affect the nuclear-armed South Asian country’s foreign policy.\n\n\n\nPakistan is over $100 billion (€92 billion) in debt, needing over $14 billion dollars a year to meet debt servicing requirements on repaying loans that it owes to international monetary institutions.\n\nPakistan relies on foreign aid to achieve financial balancing. And Saudi Arabia is the major source of financial aid to Pakistan. But under Khan, Saudi-Pakistan ties were strained over the former prime minister’s foreign policy positions which fell short of Saudi expectations. At times, Saudi Arabia even withdrew its hard currency deposits from Pakistan on short notice, causing uproar in Riyadh-Islamabad relations.\n\nUnder Khan, Pakistan developed good relations with other Islamic powers such as Turkey and Iran, a move that created a silent crisis with Riyadh. Shehbaz Sharif strongly criticized the Khan administration’s foreign policy toward Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn August 2020, when then-Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi made remarks against Saudi Arabia, Sharif was keen to castigate him.\n\n“FM’s statement about brotherly Saudi Arabia is highly unfortunate & irresponsible. It flies in the face of history of our special & trusted relationship with the Kingdom. The cavalier attitude by this govt is undermining Pakistan's core relations with friendly countries!” Sharif tweeted at the time.\n\nAfter Sharif assumed premiership a few weeks ago, Saudi Arabia also was keen to foster good relations with the new leader. The Saudis seem to hope that they would be able to distance Pakistan from Iran and bring it closer to Saudi Arabia.\n\nSharif will pay a visit to Saudi Arabia by the end of this month. This would be his first foreign trip as prime minister.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman called the new prime minister four days after he assumed office to congratulate him on his new job. Saudi media said the call confirmed the strength of relations between the two countries and stressed the need to strengthen them in all fields, noting that Sharif expressed his gratitude for the support provided by the Kingdom to Pakistan.\n\nBut Sharif, while appreciating all the assistance given by Saudi Arabia and other countries, is unlikely to radically change the balanced foreign policy of Pakistan. Because he knows that maintaining good relations with all important players serves the national interests of Pakistan. Some pundits have posited that Sharif needs to be careful in reviewing the demands that some regional powers may present in exchange for providing assistance.\n\n\n\n", 'image': 'https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2022/04/26/4/4131496.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:01:08'}

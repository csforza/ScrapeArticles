        "text": "The leadership of the Transnistrian republic is expected to declare mobilization and join the war against Ukraine after several \"explosions\". This morning, the situation in the unrecognized Russian enclave in Moldova worsened and people began to leave the borders in crowds.\n\nUkrainian intelligence reports that in unrecognized Transnistria a few days ago they began to prepare for \"explosions\" organized by the FSB to justify war with Ukraine or to involve the \"republic\" in hostilities, according to UNIAN.\n\nThe council of the self-proclaimed republic has declared a \"red\" level of terrorist threat due to three registered \"terrorist attacks\".\n\nTerrorist attacks include a strange RPG attack on the Ministry of State Security building in Tiraspol yesterday, a hit on the military barracks in Parcani and the detonation of a radio tower near the village of Mayak.\n\nThe President of Moldova convened a meeting of the Security Council in connection with the situation in occupied Transnistria. All educational institutions there switched to distance learning by the end of the school year. Checkpoints will be set up at the entrances to the cities, and inspections of vehicles and citizens will be carried out selectively during the day. During the night the control measures will be applied to everyone who enters a settlement.\n\nRussian military bases, the army and weapons depots are located on the territory of Transnistria, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Russia's General Rustam Minekayev, deputy commander of Russia's Central Military District, said last week that the population in the separatist republic was oppressed, and the second phase of the \"military operation,\" as the Kremlin calls the war in Ukraine, plans for the take over of Donbas and southern Ukraine by creating a corridor between Russia from to the Crimea to Transnistria.\n\nRussian media claim that Chisinau is putting economic pressure on Tiraspol and predict that the conflict could end with the \u201cliberation\u201d of Transnistria through Ukraine during a special military operation, given that in a referendum not even recognized by Moscow, the citizens of the \"republic\" voted to join the Russian Federation.\n\nAt the start of the war, Russia accused Ukraine of attacking the Russians in Transnistria. Kyiv immediately replied that this was a preparation for staging a Ukrainian attack and inventing an occasion for the Russian army to enter there as well.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko denied yesterday that Russia was seeking a way out of Transnistria and that it was holding a referendum on \"independence\" in Kherson. Vladimir Putin himself and Russian officials have denied, to the last, the US intelligence that Russia will invade Ukraine.\n\nMoscow-backed Transnistrian separatists waged war against the newly independent Moldova in 1992, and a truce led to the de facto separation of the region from Chisinau.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\n\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 - Novinite.bg\n\n/OFFNews",

        "text": "Boris Johnson Urged to Help Free British Fighters Captured in Ukraine\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been urged to help free two British nationals who were captured by Russia when fighting in Mariupol.\n\nThe family of Aiden Aslin told a British TV broadcaster on Monday that they hope Johnson will help and have something \u201csorted out\u201d so the 28-year-old and his fellow Briton, 48-year-old Shaun Pinner, can be returned to their families.\n\nThe UK government said it\u2019s in touch with the two families to support them. It also condemned the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes and called for anyone detained to be treated humanely in accordance with the requirements of international humanitarian law.\n\nAslin, originally from Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, north England, and Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, east England, are both members of the Ukrainian armed forces. The families said they have both been in Ukraine since 2018, long before the Russian invasion of the eastern European country.\n\nThe pair were captured earlier this month after their unit had to surrender after 48 days of defending Mariupol as they were \u201crunning out of ammunition.\u201d\n\nThey later appeared on Russian state TV, asking Johnson to help exchange for them with Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who was arrested by the Ukrainian secret services on April 12. It\u2019s not clear if they were under duress.\n\nBoth appeared to have bruises and Aslin appeared to have been beaten. Their families later said they were in contact with the UK\u2019s Foreign Office to ensure the Russian authorities \u201cmeet their obligations to prisoners of war under international law.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry on April 21 said \u201cthe Russian side [was] taking care of them,\u201d and they were \u201cfed, watered, and given the necessary assistance. Just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained.\u201d\n\nA Russian national flag flies by destroyed buildings in Mariupol, Ukraine, on April 12, 2022. (Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe UK government advises against reporting on specific individuals as this may impact their safety. The International Committee of the Red Cross also recommends not publishing images that identify prisoners of war, or show them in humiliating or degrading situations unless there\u2019s a \u201ccompelling public interest\u201d in doing so in accordance with the Geneva Convention.\n\nBut Aslin\u2019s mother Angela and his brother Nathan spoke to TalkTV on Monday, pleading for Johnson\u2019s help. Pinner\u2019s family also previously released a statement through the FCDO, rebuking Russian media\u2019s characterisation of foreign fighters in the Ukrainian military as \u201cmercenaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope that, at some point, there will be a prisoner swap. However, it\u2019s out of my hands. It is between Ukraine and Russia,\u201d Nathan Aslin told TalkTV.\n\nOutlining his recent phone conversation with his brother, Nathan Aslin told the broadcaster, \u201cIt was obvious that he was with the Russian people that were holding him and he was asking for me to contact Boris [Johnson] to get this prison swap done. And to keep on asking for this swap.\u201d\n\nAsked what he would say to the prime minister, Nathan said: \u201cAct now when you got the time to act. You\u2019ve got two British citizens on the line, being forced to say whatever the Russians are putting in [their] mouths at gunpoint, whether they show it on the camera or not. And it\u2019s a moral obligation to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAngela Aslin added: \u201cI would like to hope that Boris will help. And talk to the Ukraine government [and] embassy. There can be something sorted out so that these two guys can come home.\u201d\n\nAslin moved to Ukraine in 2018 with his Ukrainian fianc\u00e9e and now holds British and Ukrainian citizenship. He previously fought the ISIS terrorist group with Kurdish militia People\u2019s Defense Units in Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nPinner\u2019s family previously said that the former British Army soldier decided to relocate to Ukraine in 2019 \u201cto use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Pinner \u201cenjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country\u201d where he also met his Ukrainian wife.\n\nForeign Office minister James Cleverly on Tuesday confirmed that Aslin and Pinner should be treated as prisoners of war.\n\nAsked about the pair by Aslin\u2019s local MP\u2014former housing minister Robert Jenrick\u2014Cleverly told Parliament he had discussed the issue of foreign volunteer fighters with the Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201cThey are clear, and we are clear, that those fighting under the Ukrainian flag for the Ukrainian armed forces in the defence of Ukraine should be treated as Ukrainian military and as prisoners of war, with all the protections that the international humanitarian law affords to those individuals,\u201d Cleverly said.\n\nThe UK government advises against all travel to Ukraine.",

The UN said Putin made the concession to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting in Moscow.\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN atomic watchdog Rafael Grossi decried as \"very, very dangerous\" Russia's temporary occupation of the Chornobyl nuclear plant. The IAEA offered to help Ukraine repair damage caused to the stricken plant.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says the war in Ukraine has already weakened Russia's military capability. Speaking after meeting allies and partners at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, he said since the invasion started, Russia's land forces have sustained \"pretty substantial'' casualties, as well as lost a lot of equipment and used a lot of precision-guided munitions.\n\nWatch video 25:59 The Day with Phil Gayle: Diplomacy & Dialog\n\nYou can revisit our live updates from April 26 here.\n\nlo/wmr (AP,AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

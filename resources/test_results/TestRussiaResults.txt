It is worth pointing out that liquified natural gas alone supplies the market sufficiently. LNG deliveries in [terminal] Świnoujście are growing – in 2015 there was one, in 2021 it was already 35.

But the Polish government had made a clear move away from dependency by constructing a liquefied natural gas terminal in the Baltic port of Świnoujście, run by Qatari and US companies, which is capable of handling 5 bcm of gas. It is being expanded to 7.5 bcm by 2023.\n\nThe extent to which Polish industry will be able to rely on this flow is yet to be seen, however, and other countries will be worried about the development.\n\nMoscow had warned clients in March that they risked having their gas supplies cut unless they paid in roubles.\n\nThe European Commission had nevertheless said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars.\n\nThe only EU leader who has suggested he would pay Gazprom in roubles is Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, whose rightwing government has pursued a close relationship with Putin’s regime for over a decade.\n\nThe move by the Kremlin comes as EU member states are drawing up a sixth wave of sanctions that could include imposing a ceiling on the price paid for Russian oil.\n\nBut there remains a reluctance in Berlin, in particular, to go hard on gas imports given the German economy’s dependence on Russia in that field.\n\nIn early April, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told the Bundestag that the country’s energy reliance had “grown over decades and cannot be ended from one day to the next”, given that it would lead to the rationing of energy to industry and the potential closure of its largest factories.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gazprom denied that gas flows to Poland had been stopped.

The town boasted few amenities, but chief among them was the yeshiva established in 1909 by Liba Miriam Gavronskii, widowed daughter of the wealthy tea magnate Kalonymus Wissotsky. Rabbi Yitshak Yaakov Rabinovich (known as Reb Itsele Ponevezher, 1854-1919) was its first head, or rosh yeshiva.\n\nThe yeshiva flourished, but it faced an early threat to its existence with the outbreak of World War I. Seeking to undermine the Russian war effort, the Germans directed a Yiddish-language proclamation to the Jews of the Russian Empire, promising them full emancipation and equal rights once the Romanov dynasty was toppled. Already distrustful of his large Jewish population, the notoriously antisemitic Tsar Nicholas II ordered a brutal expulsion of Jews from the borderlands region to the interior of the Russian Empire.\n\nThe Yeshiva of Ponevezh was forced to relocate, first to Ludza in nearby Latvia, and then once again to Mariupol. Before returning to reestablish itself in independent Lithuania in 1919, the yeshiva would spend the remainder of the war years in Mariupol.\n\nWhy Mariupol? The great distance from the front lines certainly factored in the thinking of the rosh yeshiva, but Mariupol had developed a reputation as a haven for Jewish settlement. In 1791, the port city was added to the Pale of Settlement, the region of the Russian Empire designated for Jews. By 1847 just over a hundred Jews had established homes in Mariupol, participating in the Black Sea trade. It became a destination for Jews looking for economic opportunity and those fleeing the overcrowded regions of Lithuania and Belarus. By the end of the 19th century, the city was home to over 5,000 Jews, constituting 16% of the population; the 1926 census records 7,332 Jews in Mariupol, or 18% of the city.\n\nThe expanding, dynamic Jewish community of Mariupol — disturbed only by riots associated with the 1905 revolution — came to an abrupt end with the Nazi invasion. Mariupol’s Jews were rounded up and shot by Einsatzgruppen on a single dark day — Oct. 18, 1941 — as part of the horrific “Holocaust by Bullets.”\n\nRabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, second rosh yeshiva of the Ponevezh Yeshiva. (National Library of Israel)\n\nAs for the Lithuanian yeshiva that was sheltered by Mariupol in World War I, it went on to establish itself as one of the greatest institutions of Talmudic study during the interwar years. In 1939, however, war came to Panevezys again, with both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany invading Lithuania. Under the leadership of Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman (1888-1969), the yeshiva continued to function under Communist rule despite the fact that he was trapped outside the country, with students moving from one synagogue to another until the Nazis took over in June 1941 and murdered them all, together with most of Rabbi Kahaneman’s family.\n\nIn 1944, Rabbi Kahaneman reestablished the Ponevezh Yeshiva once again — this time in B’nai Brak, in what would become Israel — with seven students. Amazingly, it has grown to reclaim its reputation among the most prominent institutions of higher Talmudic education in the world; at 98, its current rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, is regarded by many as the spiritual leader of the “Lithuanian” non-Hasidic stream of haredi Orthodoxy.\n\nAfter the Holocaust, Jews slowly trickled back into Mariupol, which in 1948 was renamed Zhdanov by the Soviets after the sudden death of Andrei Zhdanov (1896-1948), long rumored to be Joseph Stalin’s presumed successor (his son also married the Soviet dictator’s daughter). By 1959 over 2,000 Jews lived in the city, but only constituted about 1% of the total population.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union, the city reclaimed its original name of Mariupol in 1989, and became part of newly independent Ukraine shortly thereafter. The heroic presence of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement in Mariupol, as in many formerly Soviet communities, supported the tiny Jewish population that remained after most of them emigrated to Israel in Operation Exodus — when Jews escaped the crumbling Soviet Union more than three decades ago — and continued to serve even through the Russian invasions of 2014 and 2018. Now, in the midst of the invasion of 2022, Chabad and others are working to evacuate as many of them as possible.', 'image': 'https://vinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vin-logo-2.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:30'}

The students moved from one synagogue to another until the Nazis took over in June 1941 and murdered them all, together with most of Rabbi Kahaneman’s family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1944, Rabbi Kahaneman reestablished the Ponevezh Yeshiva once again — this time in B’nai Brak, in what would become Israel — with seven students. Amazingly, it has grown to reclaim its reputation among the most prominent institutions of higher Talmudic education in the world; at 98, its current rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, is regarded by many as the spiritual leader of the “Lithuanian” non-Hasidic stream of haredi Orthodoxy.\n\nAfter the Holocaust, Jews slowly trickled back into Mariupol, which in 1948 was renamed Zhdanov by the Soviets after the sudden death of Andrei Zhdanov (1896-1948), long rumored to be Joseph Stalin’s presumed successor (his son also married the Soviet dictator’s daughter). By 1959 more than 2,000 Jews lived in the city, but only constituted about 1% of the total population.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union, the city reclaimed its original name of Mariupol in 1989 and became part of newly independent Ukraine shortly thereafter. The heroic presence of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement in Mariupol, as in many formerly Soviet communities, supported the tiny Jewish population that remained after most of them emigrated to Israel in Operation Exodus — when Jews escaped the crumbling Soviet Union more than three decades ago — and continued to serve even through the Russian invasions of 2014 and 2018. Now, in the midst of the invasion of 2022, Chabad and others are working to evacuate as many of them as possible.\n\n––\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of JTA or its parent company, 70 Faces Media.', 'image': 'https://static.timesofisrael.com/blogs/uploads/2022/04/02-25-2022-Mariupol-Synagogue.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:58:57'}

The White House has not confirmed any visit. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\nZelenskyy earlier said he was "expecting specific things and specific weapons" from world leaders who come to the country. He said he would ask Blinken and Austin for more powerful weapons during their talks.\n\nNo humanitarian routes out of Mariupol on Sunday\n\nIryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine\'s Deputy Prime Minister, said that no humanitarian routes were established to bring civilians and the wounded out of Mariupol on Sunday.\n\nVereshchuk blamed Russian forces for continuing their siege on the southern port city that has faced weeks of bombardment.\n\nThe Ukrainian side would try again on Monday, Vereshchuk said. She called on UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to demand a ceasefire "if he is preparing to talk about peace" ahead of his travels to Moscow and then Kyiv next week.\n\nUN: Almost 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees since war started\n\nThe UN refugee agency said 5,186,744 Ukrainians have fled since the start of Russia\'s invasion, an increase of 23,058 on Saturday\'s figures.\n\nIn April so far, more than 1,151,000 Ukrainians have fled their country compared with 3.4 million during the month of March.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi wrote on Twitter that this Orthodox Easter "will be another day of fear, anguish, loss and separation from loved ones, as war continues to rage without mercy."\n\nThe International Organization of Migration (IOM) estimates that more than 7.7 million people are internally displaced within Ukraine.\n\nLuhansk governor says shelling kills civilians\n\nSerhiy Gaidai, the regional governor of Luhansk, said several civilians were killed by Russian shelling on Orthodox Easter Sunday.\n\nIn a video address to mark the holiday, Gaidai said, "Today, once again, civilians have died.

On Saturday, Ukrainian officials issued similar warnings and said Russian forces were laying siege to the plant.\n\nPope Francis appeals for truce again\n\nThe blue and yellow Ukrainian flag flew among those gathered on St. Peter\'s Square in the Vatican this Orthodox Easter weekend as Pope Francis appealed again for a truce in Ukraine.\n\nHe called for an easing of "the suffering of exhausted people."\n\nFrancis added that, "Instead of halting, the war has become worse."\n\nEchoing the calls of senior Ukrainian government officials, Francis said, "I renew the appeal for an Easter truce, the smallest tangible sign of a willingness for peace."\n\nRussia\'s US envoy says consulates\' bank accounts closed\n\nRussian ambassador Anatoly Antonov said Sunday that the work of Russian diplomatic missions in the US was essentially "blockaded" by US government entities.\n\n"Accounts of our two consulates in Houston and New York have been closed by Bank of America," Antonov was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency.\n\nHe also said Russian diplomatic sites were receiving threats via telephone and in the mail.\n\nOSCE says members captured in Donetsk and Luhansk\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said it is "extremely concerned" about the detention of several members of its monitoring mission in the eastern part of the country.\n\nIn a brief tweet, the Vienna-based organization said several of its mission members "have been deprived of their liberty in Donetsk and Luhansk" and that OSCE was "using all available channels to facilitate their release."\n\nAn OSCE spokesperson failed to provide specifics such as how many Ukrainian nationals involved in the monitoring mission had been detained or when or who may be holding them.

Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine also called for a truce as both Russia and Ukraine mark Orthodox Easter this Sunday.\n\nMoscow blocks leading chess site\n\nChess.com, one of the most popular chess websites in the world, is now inaccessible in Russia. According to the Interfax news agency, the country\'s media supervisor Roskomnadzor has blocked two of its pages with information about the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian prosecutors demanded the move on Saturday. As the site uses https network protocol, barring the access to those pages has reportedly caused the entire site to be inaccessible in Russia.\n\nPreviously, Russian grandmaster Sergei Karjakin had called for the pages with information about what Russia calls its "special military operations" in Ukraine to be blocked.\n\nRussia claims it struck arms depots in the Kharkiv region\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense said Sunday that it had struck nine Ukrainian military targets overnight.\n\nIncluded among those targets were four arms depots in the Kharkiv region where artillery is stored and a facility producing military grade explosives in Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nWatch video 02:39 A village in Ukraine marks Good Friday in wartime\n\nUkrainian negotiator calls for a \'real Easter truce\'\n\nMykhailo Podoliak, the senior Ukrainian negotiator and presidential advisor, urged a "real Easter truce" as both Ukraine and Russia mark Orthodox Easter.\n\nOn Twitter, Podoliak also urged a humanitarian corridor out of the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\n"Russia is continuously attacking the Mariupol Azovstal. The place where our civilians and military are located, is shelled with heavy air bombs and artillery."\n\nPodoliak urged Russia to "think of the remnants of its reputation."\n\nUkraine says Russia deployed Iskander-M missile launchers near border\n\nRussia has moved Iskander-M missile launchers to sites within 60 kilometers (40 miles) of Ukraine\'s border, said the General Staff of Ukraine\'s Armed Forces.\n\nThe mobile ballistic Iskander system has a range of up to 500 kilometers and is armed with two guided missiles capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads.\n\n"The enemy has increased the number of troops in (Russia\'s) Belgorod region by transferring and concentrating additional units," Ukraine\'s Armed Forces said in their daily morning update.\n\nWatch video 03:24 Missile attack on Odesa during Orthodox Easter\n\nZelenskyy hopes for \'eternal harmony\' following peace in Ukraine\n\nIn his message for Orthodox Easter, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the holiday is a reminder that "light wins over darkness," therefore "Ukraine must win!"\n\nZelenskyy said Ukrainians were praying for a day of "great peace" in Ukraine which would bring "eternal harmony and prosperity."\n\nThe politician recorded the video message at the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kyiv where "a thousand years ago, on the field of the holy battle, the army of Kievan Rus-Ukraine defeated the [medival Turkic nations of] Pechenegs," Zelenskyy noted.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine trace their countries\' origins to the medieval state of Kievan Rus. The Kremlin has argued that because of this, Ukraine\'s national identity is virtually identical to Russia\'s; Kyiv strongly objects.\n\nMeanwhile, Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world\'s Eastern Orthodox Christians, called from Istanbul for humanitarian corridors to be opened in Ukraine where he said "an indescribable human tragedy is unfolding."\n\n"We call once again for an immediate end to the fratricidal war, which, like any war, undermines human dignity," Bartholomew added.\n\nSwitzerland impedes German arms deliveries: report\n\nSwitzerland has blocked the re-export from Germany to Ukraine of Swiss-produced ammunition used in German-made Marder infantry fighting vehicles, according to the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.\n\nThe move by Switzerland, which maintains a neutral status, has held up arms deliveries by Germany at a time when Berlin is already under fire for failing to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons to help fight off Russia\'s invasion of the country.\n\nSwitzerland has gone against previous practice and adopted EU sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for its invasion, but has insisted its neutrality does not allow it to send arms to conflict zones. Swiss officials have previously rejected Poland\'s request for the Alpine state to send arms to Ukraine.\n\nThe Marder vehicles are made by German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall but use Swiss-manufactured ammunition.\n\nUK says Russian troops suffer from poor morale\n\nRussia has made "some territorial gains" since starting the ongoing offensive in the east of the country, according to UK military intelligence. At the same time, UK officials said that Ukraine provided strong resistance and inflicted significant losses on the Russian forces.\n\n"Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness," they said on Twitter.\n\nUkraine governor says Russian attacks killed 8 in Luhansk\n\nRussian shelling killed eight people and injured two more in Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, according to governor Serhiy Gaidai.

Reuters could not verify the report.The head of Ukraine\'s state rail company said that one railway worker had been killed and four injured by Russian missile strikes on five Ukrainian railway stations on Monday.Ukrainian forces have repelled five Russian attacks and killed just over 200 Russian servicemen, said the Ukrainian military command in the southern and eastern sectors.Five tanks were also destroyed, along with eight armoured vehicles, it said in a statementReuters was not able to immediately verify the reports.Russian forces were continuing on Monday to bomb and shell the vast Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol where fighters are hunkered down in a city ravaged by a siege and bombardment, Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said.Moscow said it was opening a humanitarian corridor to let civilians out of the plant but Kyiv said no agreement had been reached.', 'image': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-91087707,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-135056,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:13'}

This was, in our judgment, an important moment to be there to have face-to-face conversations in detail.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the US is offering “powerful” support to his country. Mr Zelensky added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nHe noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow was also on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nMr Austin said Mr Zelensky’s response to the aid was deep appreciation for what was being given but “he has the mindset that they want to win and we have the mindset that we want to help them win”.\n\nThe talks came as Russia unleashed a string of attacks against Ukrainian rail and fuel facilities on Monday, striking crucial infrastructure far from the front line of its eastern offensive, which Britain said has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, third from left, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, forth from left, meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, fourth from right, in Kyiv (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was a lightning offensive that would quickly take the capital and perhaps even topple the government in Kyiv. But the Ukrainians, aided by Western weapons, bogged down President Vladimir Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its focus is in the eastern region of the Donbas, but one senior military official says it also wants to control southern Ukraine. While both sides said the campaign in the east has begun, it has yet to gather steam.\n\nA small group of Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces, and keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor on Monday for them to leave.\n\nRussian tanks roll along a street in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Mariupol, Ukraine (Alexei Alexandrov/AP)\n\nBut for now, the British Defence Ministry said that Ukrainian forces have repelled numerous assaults in the past week and “inflicted significant cost on Russian forces”. It said, so far, Russia has “yet to achieve a significant breakthrough” since shifting its focus to the Donbas.\n\nInstead, Russian missiles and war planes struck far behind the front line of that offensive on Monday.\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday, including a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nSerhiy Borzov, the governor of Ukraine’s central Vinnytsia region, said there were casualties after rocket strikes targeting “critical infrastructure”. It was not clear if that referred to the attacks on the railways.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries.\n\nA Russian news report said that another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire early Monday.\n\nIn footage later released by the Ukrainian presidency of the meeting with top US officials, Mr Blinken praised the “extraordinary courage and leadership and success that you’ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression”.\n\nMr Austin said at the news conference that “the world has been inspired” by Ukraine in the war and that America will continue its support. “What you’ve done in repelling the Russians in the Battle of Kyiv is extraordinary,” he said.\n\nMr Zelensky had announced on Saturday that he would meet the US officials in Kyiv on Sunday, but Joe Biden’s administration refused to confirm that and declined to discuss details of a possible visit even though planning had been under way for more than a week.\n\nJournalists who travelled to Poland with Mr Austin and Mr Blinken were barred from reporting on the trip until it ended, were not allowed to accompany them on their overland journey into Ukraine, and were prohibited from specifying where in south-east Poland they waited for the Cabinet members to return. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon cited security concerns.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nSuch financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need.\n\nThe new money, along with the sale of 165 million dollars (£128 million) in non-US made ammunition that is compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use, takes the total amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to 3.7 billion dollars (£2.9 billion) since the invasion, officials said.\n\nUS officials said they believed the new assistance would satisfy at least some of the Ukrainians’ urgent pleas for more help. New artillery, including howitzers, continues to be delivered at a rapid pace to Ukraine’s military, which is being trained on its use in neighbouring countries, the officials said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\nMs Brink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the US Senate.\n\nMr Blinken also told Ukraine’s foreign minister that the small staff from the US embassy in Kyiv, which has relocated to Poland from temporary offices in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, will begin making day trips to Lviv in the coming days.\n\nOfficials said the US had accelerated its review of security conditions in the capital and that the State Department will reopen the embassy there as soon as the situation allows.\n\nMr Biden has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of genocide for the destruction and death wrought on Ukraine. On Thursday, the US leader said he would provide a new package of 800 million dollars (£623 million) in military aid to Ukraine that included heavy artillery and drones.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nFrom Poland, Mr Blinken plans to return to Washington while Mr Austin will head to Ramstein in Germany for a meeting Tuesday of Nato defence ministers and other donor countries.\n\nThat discussion will look at battlefield updates from the ground, additional security assistance for Ukraine and longer-term defence needs in Europe, including how to step up military production to fill gaps caused by the war in Ukraine, officials said. More than 20 nations are expected to send representatives to the meeting.', 'image': 'https://jerseyeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25144250/Img33212545-4.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:53'}

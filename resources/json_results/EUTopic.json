        "text": "ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 A Turkish court on Monday sentenced prominent Turkish civil rights activist and philanthropist Osman Kavala to life in prison without parole, finding him guilty of attempting to overthrow the government with mass protests in 2013. Western governments and rights groups strongly criticized the ruling, with one calling it \u201ca travesty of justice of spectacular proportions.\u201d\n\nThe court in Istanbul also sentenced seven other defendants, including 71-year-old architect Mucella Yapici, to 18 years in prison each for \u201caiding\u201d the attempt. It ordered that the activists, who were not in custody, be immediately arrested, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\n\nThe verdict, which is likely to harm Turkey's ties with Western nations, comes as Europe\u2019s top human rights body, the Council of Europe, launched infringement procedures against Turkey for refusing to abide by a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which in 2019 called for Kavala\u2019s release on grounds that his rights had been violated.\n\nKavala, 64, has been jailed in Silivri prison, on the outskirts of Istanbul, since he was detained Oct. 18, 2017, accused of financing the protests. He and other defendants denied all the accusations and are expected to appeal the verdicts.\n\nHuman rights groups say Kavala was prosecuted with flimsy evidence and that the case is politically motivated. Kavala is the founder of a nonprofit organization, Anadolu Kultur, which focuses on cultural and artistic projects promoting peace and dialogue.\n\nSupporters of Kavala and the seven other defendants immediately protested the verdicts Monday, shouting slogans in support of the 2013 protests that morphed from a dispute over building a mall in an Istanbul park into wider demonstrations against the government of then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the verdict \u201cblatantly contradicts the constitutional standards and international obligations that Turkey commits itself to as a member of the Council of Europe and EU accession candidate.\u201d\n\n\"We expect Osman Kavala to be released immediately -- the European Court of Human Rights has bindingly obliged Turkey to do so,\u201c Baerbock said.\n\nThe rights group PEN America called the verdict a \u201cdark moment for Turkey\u201d while Nils Muiznieks, Amnesty International\u2019s director for Europe, said it amounted to a \u201ctravesty of justice of spectacular proportions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision defies all logic. The prosecuting authorities have repeatedly failed to provide any evidence that substantiates the baseless charges of attempting to overthrow the government,\u201d Muiznieks said in a statement. \"We continue to call for Osman Kavala\u2019s and his co-defendants\u2019 immediate release as they appeal these draconian verdicts.\u201d\n\nOzgur Ozel, an opposition legislator whose party frequently questions the independence of Turkey's courts, accused the judiciary of allegedly meeting the wishes of Erdogan, who is now president.\n\n\u201cJustice did not prevail here today \u2014 the will of the person who rules this country was carried out,\u201d he told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\nOzel also denounced the trial as an attempt by Erdogan to \u201cdemonize the protests that were extremely peaceful and were staged out of environmental concerns.\"\n\nAsked for his final words in court on Monday, Kavala said: \u201cThe aggravated life sentence demanded against me is an assassination that cannot be explained through legal reasons,\u201d according to the Media and Law Studies Association group which has been monitoring the trial.\n\nIn his defense statements Friday, Kavala rejected the accusations once again, insisting that he had merely taken pastries and face masks to the protesters. He said allegations that he directed the protests are \u201cnot plausible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that I spent 4.5 years of my life in prison is an irreparable loss for me. My only consolation is the possibility that my experience will contribute to a better understanding of the grave problems of the judiciary,\u201d Kavala told the court by videoconference from Silivri.\n\nKavala was initially acquitted in February 2020 of charges that connected him with the 2013 Gezi Park protests. As supporters awaited his release, Kavala was rearrested on new charges linking him to Turkey's 2016 coup attempt. The acquittal was later overturned and the case was merged with that relating to the coup attempt, which the Turkish government blames on the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies any links to the attempted coup.\n\nThe court on Monday acquitted Kavala of charges linked to the coup attempt, saying there was insufficient evidence, Anadolu reported.\n\nIn October, Kavala\u2019s continued detention sparked a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and 10 Western countries, including the United States, France and Germany, after they called for his release on the fourth anniversary of his imprisonment.\n\nErdogan has accused Kavala, of being the \u201cTurkish branch\u201d of billionaire U.S. philanthropist George Soros, whom the Turkish leader alleges has been behind insurrections in many countries. He has threatened to expel Western envoys for meddling in Turkey\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights\u2019 2019 decision said Kavala\u2019s imprisonment aimed to silence him and other human rights defenders and wasn\u2019t supported by evidence of an offense.\n\nThe lengthy infringement process by the Council of Europe, a 47-member bloc that upholds human rights, could lead to the suspension of Turkey\u2019s voting rights or membership in the organization.\n\nErdogan has dismissed the infringement process, saying Turkey would not \u201crecognize those who do not recognize our courts.\u201d Turkey had argued that Kavala\u2019s detention was linked to the 2016 attempted coup and not the previous charges that were reviewed by the European court.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

        "channel": "dw.com",
        "text": "The German government has listed several reasons why it's been unable to dispatch heavy weapons to Ukraine. Do those claims hold up? Several of its explanations are listed below.\n\nGermany is simply following the lead of its allies\n\nThis has been Chancellor Olaf Scholz's mantra since the outbreak of the war. He has said he's doing everything in close coordination with NATO and EU partners. \"Look at what our allies are doing, for example our friends in the G7,\" he said at a press conference on Tuesday, pointing out that countries like Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States were supplying the same weapons that Germany was sending.\n\nBut on Thursday, the US announced a new military aid package worth $800 million (\u20ac740 million) for Ukraine, including for heavy artillery. That brings the total to more than $3 billion in aid since Russia launched its invasion on February 24.\n\nBy contrast, as of early April, the latest information that has been made available, German spending for Ukraine's military defense stood at around \u20ac186 million, according to the Economic Affairs Ministry. That was mainly used to buy rocket-propelled grenades, anti-aircraft rockets, machine guns, ammunition and protective gear \u2014 but not heavy weapons.\n\nProfessor Carlo Masala, a defense and security expert at the Bundeswehr University Munich, said Scholz is on the one hand delivering a message to the Russians by saying Germany is still holding back on heavy weapons. On the other hand, it's also a signal to the domestic audience and his center-left party, the Social Democrats.\n\n\"This is an issue which is now being debated among various groups in the Social Democratic Party, and he needs them in parliament. He needs all those people who don't want to deliver heavy weapons because they think that this will escalate the conflict and that Germany will become a target of Russian activities,\" he told DW.\n\nWhile that's a justifiable concern, it's difficult to reconcile with the news that several Western countries, including the US, the UK and the Netherlands, have delivered heavy weapons, according to a recent tweet from Ukrainian lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko.\n\nThe Czech Republic has reportedly also signed off on sending several dozen Soviet-made T-72 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles. The US announced last week that it would quickly deliver 11 Russian-built Mi-17 helicopters, 200 M113 armored personnel carriers and 90 155-mm field howitzers with 40,000 artillery shells \u2014 all of which would qualify as heavy weapons.\n\nPer the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, heavy weapons refers to all tanks and armored vehicles, and all artillery 100 mm and above. Combat aircraft and combat helicopters are also classified as heavy weaponry.\n\nBundeswehr is stretched to its limits\n\nGermany has said it is unable to send more military aid to Ukraine, because it would then be unable to fulfill its national and NATO obligations.\n\n\"Here, we now have to recognize that the options we have are reaching their limits,\" Scholz said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Bundeswehr has said it needs its heavy weapons to guarantee national and alliance defense obligations. This applies, for example, to Marder infantry fighting vehicles or the self-propelled howitzer 2000, a heavy artillery gun.\n\nWatch video 03:26 Why is Germany not sending heavy weapons?\n\n\"In order to ensure the operability of our army, we need the weapons systems,\" Deputy Inspector General Markus Laubenthal told public broadcaster ZDF on Wednesday. He said the Marder tank is needed for national and NATO commitments.\n\nThe Marder is a combat system that includes guided missiles, handheld weapons and ammunition and requires extensive training. Although the training time could be shortened, \"it is still a matter of weeks, and the equipment would have to be prepared,\" said Laubenthal.\n\nHis comments came in response to remarks by Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, one of the most vociferous critics of Berlin's approach.\n\n\"The claim that the Bundeswehr would not be able to deliver anything to Ukraine is not comprehensible,\" Melnyk said recently. He said the force has around 400 Marders. Of those about 100 are used for training and could therefore be handed over to Ukraine immediately, he added.\n\nDefense expert Masala said the government is using this excuse as a pretext. \"If the defense of NATO's territory depends on, let's say, 20 German tanks, then we shouldn't even try to defend NATO's territory because this would be disastrous,\" he said.\n\nAvailable arms are of no immediate use to Ukrainians\n\nThe government's argument is that the Ukrainian soldiers can only handle weapons they are familiar with. That includes the logistics of being able to carry out repairs with the corresponding spare parts.\n\nMasala sees this as a valid concern. \"What happens if there is a problem, a technical problem with the Marder? You don't have the spare parts. You don't have the technicians who can repair it,\" he said. \"You need to make sure that there is a logistics line going into Ukraine where they have spare parts, where they have trained technicians.\"\n\nThe question is whether it wouldn't be more effective to put the tanks in Ukrainians hands now and worry about logistics later. On that point, Masala agrees.\n\n\"Train them to use the model, send them over to Ukraine. If they can use the Marder for three weeks, it's better than nothing. If the Marder breaks down, then OK, bad luck,\" he said. \"In the meantime, we can work on the logistic chain for the supply of spare parts. So once again, it looks to me like a pretext not to send them because it's a political decision not to send heavy armor into Ukraine.\"\n\nWatch video 02:00 On the road with Ukraine's territorial defense force\n\nFormer NATO General Hans-Lothar Domr\u00f6se is dismissive of the claims that extensive training would be required to master the Marder combat vehicles.\n\n\"We're talking about seasoned Ukrainian commanders who have been fighting since 2014. They don't need to be told how to use them. Those who have been using the Soviet BMP-1 model can familiarize themselves with the Marder in under a week and operate it,\" he told public broadcaster WDR on Thursday.\n\nBerlin's response: More money, and a creative workaround\n\nScholz has said Berlin is releasing more than \u20ac1 billion to enable Ukraine to finance purchases of military equipment from Germany. He listed anti-tank weapons, air defense equipment and ammunition as examples, but did not mention the tanks and planes Ukraine has been asking for.\n\nBild reported that German defense companies initially offered to supply heavy weapons such as Marders, Boxer armored vehicles, Leopard 2 tanks and self-propelled howitzers. However, according to the daily tabloid, those items now appear to have been crossed off the list.\n\n\"There are some heavy weapons on the list, but definitely not tanks. So, tanks seem to be a red line for the German government right now. Whether we can keep the red line depends, of course, very much on the development of the war in the coming weeks or months,\" said Masala.\n\nThe criticism of Germany's foot-dragging appears to have made an impression. On Thursday, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said at a press conference in Estonia that \"there are no taboos for us with regard to armored vehicles and other weaponry that Ukraine needs,\" a reference to the possible supply of Marder vehicles.\n\nThe workaround for Germany appears to be a plan to backfill the stocks of allied countries that have weaponry to spare with modern German-made gear. As Germany's stocks are reportedly depleted, Eastern European NATO countries that still have Soviet-era weapons in their possession would \"make these weapons available, as has already happened in several cases,\" said retired Bundeswehr Colonel Wolfgang Richter, a senior associate with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.\n\nDefense Minister Christine Lambrecht on Thursday confirmed the planned exchange with NATO and the EU. \"We're talking about tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, it's about different options that individual countries have that they can hand over. We're in talks and it's happening very quickly now,\" Lambrecht told commercial broadcaster RTL/n-tv.\n\nOne option the government is working on is an exchange with Slovenia. The NATO partner would send several of its Soviet-era T-72 battle tanks to Ukraine; to compensate, Germany would then provide Slovenia with Marders from its own supplies.\n\nAnother creative workaround is reportedly being arranged with the Netherlands. \"The Netherlands are going to send the self-propelled howitzer 2000, an extremely modern German weapon, and we're going to provide [the Ukrainians] with ammunition and the training, probably on German soil,\" said Masala.\n\nThis approach could relieve some of the pressure and deflect criticism. However, as Masala pointed out, it won't last long.\n\n\"Our Eastern European partners are running out of old Soviet weaponry. And the Soviet tanks sent by Poland, Slovakia or Slovenia are going to be destroyed during this war,\" he said. \"Ukraine will run out of these weapons too. At a certain point, the question will come back: whether to train Ukrainians and deliver modern Western weapon systems.\"\n\nMichael Trobridge contributed to this article.\n\nEdited by: Martin Kuebler",

        "text": "It is only by deepening political integration, presenting genuinely progressive and realistic solutions and gaining more influence in the European political space that we can deploy our ambitious social and economic agenda, write MEPs from three different groups of the European Parliament and members of the Progressive Caucus.\n\nThis op-ed was written by MEP Dom\u00e8nec Ruiz Devesa (S&D), MEP Ernest Urtasun (Greens/EFA) and Vice-President of the European Parliament Dimitrios Papadimoulis (Left).\n\nWe are living today in the context of an unthinkable war. Putin\u2019s military aggression in Ukraine has demonstrated the need for unity within the EU, now more than ever. The path to this unity is through political integration, primarily the implementation of concrete and lasting proposals stemming from the resolutions of the Conference on the Future of Europe (CoFoE).\n\nThe economic collapse of 2008-2009, the Euro crisis of 2010-2012 and the COVID-19 pandemic shall be viewed as hallmarks of the demise of the neoliberal doctrine that for decades arrogantly touted the benefits of financial deregulation, labour market liberalisation, privatisation of state companies and public services, industrial delocalisation, unbalanced free trade and the minimal state.\n\nAs a result, the economic system as a whole has become unsustainable, fragile and prone to shocks. Economic, social and regional inequalities have increased dramatically, and essential public services \u2013 particularly healthcare and social welfare systems \u2013 came into the pandemic from an already weakened position.\n\nMany of these neoliberal policies were promoted and endorsed by the EU and its member states throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, despite essential instruments of social policy like the European Social Fund, the European Social Chapter, and critical legislative milestones like the Working Time Directive.\n\nThe birth of the Euro in 1992 created both opportunities and challenges. In many cases, it enhanced neoliberal approaches of market-oriented competitiveness, focusing on disinflation, deficit and debt reduction as paramount objectives, based on an unsuccessful EU economic governance framework to the detriment of full employment, social policies and the environment.\n\nTrue to form, the EU led by Merkel and Sarkozy and a right-wing majority in the European institutions responded to the debt crisis of 2010 with extreme austerity policies, thus provoking a second recession, social deprivation and discontent, and the rise of far-right, Eurosceptic, anti-European and anti-immigration political forces.\n\nNevertheless, some EU policies started to change with the expansionary monetary policy of the European Central Bank, and later on with the first Investment Plan for Europe, albeit very limited in scope, and the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPRS), an important declaration but of a non-binding nature. However, other important projects of that era \u2013 also extremely relevant today \u2013 remain uncompleted, like the banking union endowed with a common deposit guarantee.\n\nThe pandemic has already forced the Union to step away from or even abandon old dogmas in favour of a more flexible and progressive approach, trying to rebalance the market-state equation in favour of the latter. The public debt rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) have been suspended to sustain incomes and jobs. The Health Union has been launched, including the common purchasing of vaccines.\n\nA Recovery Plan for Europe, financed by Eurobonds (the same ones blatantly rejected in 2010), is in place to distribute loans and grants, to be paid back by future EU taxes on financial transactions, CO2 and digital platforms. This is tantamount to an embryo of financial and fiscal union, which we welcome, but this also requires continuity and political-strategic planning for concrete results and full democratic legitimation by enhancing accountability and transparency.\n\nIndeed, CoFoE constitutes a significant opportunity to consolidate the pandemic\u2019s progressive openings. The SGP must be thoroughly reformed and converted into a Sustainability Development and Employment Pact to incorporate social justice, full employment and a green economy as key objectives, adopt new realistic debt and deficit rules, set real and upward social, economic and regional convergence targets, while excluding public investment from debt and deficit calculations.\n\nThe Recovery Plan must be converted into a permanent tool for financing social convergence and the green and digital transitions and as an anti-cyclical fiscal capacity. The ECB should be allowed to provide direct financial assistance to the Union during emergencies like the pandemic. The EPSR should be incorporated into the Treaty with the same binding force of the four market freedoms and the climate neutrality goals.\n\nIt is also high time for a reformed and humane migration policy that fully respects human rights and our founding values, based on the shared responsibility of the member states. Europe, facing demographic decline and rural depopulation, can only benefit from the well-managed and orderly arrival of migrants and must at the same time show solidarity with people fleeing tyranny and war. During this crisis provoked by Putin\u2019s aggression, our Union should deliver guarantee peace and safety for all through the implementation of common efforts and initiatives.\n\nIn the long decade between two crises \u2013 the financial crash and the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 the EU has been frozen with a de facto overconcentration of powers in the Council, to the detriment of the Parliament, the only institution directly elected by the citizens. At the same time, the Commission\u2019s role as the guardian of the Treaties is fading away, sliding closer to Council\u2019s positions. This strong intergovernmental bias against the Community method has not only widened the \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d of the Union, but also constrained advances in social policy, among others, due to unanimity requirements. The nascent financial and fiscal union only deepens this democratic dilemma.\n\nTherefore, the Parliament should be empowered to co-decide on EU debt and taxation with the Council, with the right to initiate legislation. The Council should become a true Chamber of States, making decisions with a qualified majority. The EU should show zero tolerance when the rule of law is not respected. Lastly, a pan-European electoral constituency should be established to generate a transnational debate and campaign, make European political parties visible and more powerful, and strengthen the lead candidate system for the election of the President of the Commission.\n\nWe commit ourselves to strive towards these policy and institutional objectives at CoFoE, an innovative forum with the participation of social partners, organised civil society, and randomly selected citizens. We firmly believe that this occasion can pave the way for a more united and progressive Europe, equitably providing the much-needed transnational public goods that citizens need and expect from the Union.\n\nEurope must be capable of establishing itself as a virtuous model in the eyes of its member states and the whole world, as a champion and defender of the values of democracy and peace on which our Union was built.",

        "text": "The Freedom Movement of Robert Golub, which campaigned on a platform of green energy, media freedom and rule of law, has ousted the populist Slovenian Democratic party of erstwhile PM Janez Jan\u0161a.\n\nWith much of the world\u2019s focus this past weekend on events in Ukraine and the French presidential election, a political earthquake in Slovenia went largely unnoticed.\n\nOn April 24, the same day that French voters returned Emmanuel Macron to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace for a second term in office, Slovenians were voting in a parliamentary election that the Slovenian Democratic party of Janez Jan\u0161a, the current populist prime minister, had been expected to win.\n\nInstead, Slovenians turned in large numbers to a new political party, the Freedom Movement (GS) of liberal Robert Golob, which launched only in January.\n\nGS, which campaigned on a platform of transitioning to green energy, an open society and respect for the rule of law, took around 34.5 per cent of the vote compared to 23.5 per cent for Jan\u0161a\u2019s Democrats, although the newcomers \u2013 expected to take 41 seats in the 90-seat parliament \u2013 are unlikely to be able to form a government without looking to Slovenia\u2019s smaller parties for support.\n\nThe Social Democrats and the Left party are Golub\u2019s most likely coalition partners.\n\n\u201cPeople really want change,\u201d Golob, an entrepreneur with little experience in politics, said, declaring victory via video link from his home where he was isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. \u201cToday people are dancing, but tomorrow a new day begins. Tomorrow we\u2019ll start working hard.\u201d\n\nFor Jan\u0161a, who took office in 2018, the result almost certainly ends a colourful and often controversial political career.\n\nJan\u0161a last year survived an impeachment motion filed by four opposition parties, accusing him of mismanaging the Covid-19 pandemic, failing to order enough vaccines, and attacking the media, most notably the state-funded news agency STA.\n\nIn February 2021, the Slovenian government\u2019s communication office suspended payments to STA, which many in the country viewed as an attack on the editorial independence of the agency.\n\nIn its latest Freedom in the World report, Freedom House, an organisation that conducts research and advocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights, said that while political rights and civil liberties are generally respected in Slovenia, the Jan\u0161a government had throughout 2021 continued attempts to undermine the rule of law and democratic institutions, including the media and judiciary, and that corruption remains an issue.\n\nDuring his time in office, Jan\u0161a earnt himself the nickname \u201cMarshall Twito\u201d for the way in which he made use of the social media platform Twitter to attack opponents and make baseless claims, such as a bizarre post congratulating Donald Trump on his reelection as US president when it was already clear that Trump had been defeated by Joe Biden.\n\nAn increasingly isolated Viktor Orb\u00e1n\n\nJan\u0161a\u2019s loss leaves Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n increasingly isolated within the European Union. The pair, both staunch eurosceptics, had been close, with Slovenia\u2019s clampdown on the media often described as \u201cHungary-like\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, unlike Orb\u00e1n, who has been reluctant to offer anything except the most perfunctory support for Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia\u2019s invasion, Jan\u0161a has taken a hardline approach towards Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin \u2013 he was one of the first international leaders to visit Kyiv following Moscow\u2019s invasion on February 24.\n\n\u201cThe results are what they are,\u201d Jan\u0161a said after the first results of the election were published, highlighting his government\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cMany challenges lie ahead for the new government, whatever it may look like, but the foundations are solid.\u201d\n\nSlovenia\u2019s economy is expected to grow 3.7 per cent in 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said last week, lowering its forecast for a 4.6 per cent increase made in October. In 2021, the country\u2019s economy expanded by 8.1 per cent.\n\nThe IMF also expects average consumer price inflation of 6.7 per cent in Slovenia in 2022, accelerating from 1.9 per cent last year.\n\nPhoto: Robert Golub posting his electoral ballot.

For example, the U.A.E. government has authorized a $15.5-billion budget to promote health, social, infrastructure, and cultural initiatives, as well as educational development in the country. Moreover, in 2020, for adding 8 million square meters of parks and green spaces to commercial and residential areas, funding of $544.5 million was approved in Dubai for 29 projects.\n\nGet the sample pages of this report at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/uae-saudi-arabia-property-management-software-market/report-sample\n\nWhereas, in 2021, the Saudi Arabia property management software market size stood at $37.0 million. There are several factors for the market growth, including the advancing construction activities, need for property management to be handled remotely, and rising demand for the SaaS model of property management. Above all, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs of Saudi Arabia has started smart city initiatives under the Saudi Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program 2020.\n\nIn the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia property management software market, the solutions category was predicted to have a revenue share of more than 70% in 2021. This was mostly due to the increasing demand for digital property management operations, the desire to limit the number of meetings as much as feasible, and the need to improve virtual colleague and manager cooperation. Furthermore, solutions assist businesses in methodically managing their clientele and providing simple payment and digital financing.\n\nOne of the main innovations in the software business is the cloud technology, which has drastically changed the way software programs are distributed to clients. As a result of this shift, software engineers may now concentrate on the technological aspects of their work, while outsourcing the administration to cloud service providers. There are many advantages of the SaaS model that will advance the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia property management software market growth in the future, such as reduced infra expenses and remote access.\n\nREACH by RentCafe, a comprehensive digital marketing company for multifamily property management, was established by Yardi in August 2021. REACH provides website creation services for businesses and properties, as well as bespoke design materials, such as logos and email templates. Via search marketing, creative, and strategy analysis, it also assists clients in reaching more tenants, improving marketing success, and reducing unnecessary expenditure.\n\nBrowse detailed report on U.A.E. & Saudi Arabia Property Management Software Market Size and Forecast Report, 2030\n\nSimilarly, RealPage Inc. introduced On-Call Live Tours in March 2021 as part of its new peak performance (P2) virtual leasing package.

This is more than double the share it commanded in 2020 and triple of what it had in 2019.\n\nIn the Middle East, interest in eco-friendly alternatives to the internal combustion engine vehicle is slowly growing as automobile manufacturers race to bring more EV models to the market every year.\n\nSaudi Arabia aims for at least 30 percent of its cars to be electric powered by 2030, following its pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2060. Last year, EV manufacturer Lucid announced a long-term plan to build the first international manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia, targeting 150,000 vehicles per year at the King Abdullah Economic City.\n\nSaudi Arabia is planning new electric vehicles production plants capable of building 150,000 models per year and an EV infrastructure to support them. (Madinah Municipality)\n\nMeanwhile, the UAE is pushing for 42,000 EVs to be on its streets within the next decade. To meet the rise in demand for green mobility, the UAE opened its first electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Dubai Industrial City last month, built at a total cost of $408 million. The facility is expected to produce 55,000 cars per year.\n\nThere is strong competition for a share of the GCC region’s EV market, with brands such as Tesla leading the charge and others including BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz in close pursuit.\n\nNoor Hajir, head of transport planning and mobility at WSP Middle East, says there are positive signals in the Gulf marketplace, with many developers, particularly those in Saudi Arabia, embracing greener alternatives and future mobility solutions such as EVs to help them achieve their future net-zero targets.\n\n“We’re seeing a trend of private developers leveraging EV charging stations as a branding and customer incentivization tool within assets such as major malls and business districts,” she said.\n\nStill, Hajir believes the region has a long way to go before the infrastructure required to make widespread private and public EV adoption a reality is in place.\n\n“The Middle East may be behind the curve compared with more developed economies in providing roadside infrastructure to facilitate and incentivize widespread private EV ownership, which relies heavily on public sector endorsement,” she told Arab News.\n\nBeyond the challenge of having enough charging stations, EVs must also tackle the region's host and arid climate. (AFP)\n\nDr. Hamid Haqparwar, managing director of BMW Group Middle East, said infrastructure development for EVs in the region varies from country to country, resulting in different rates of adoption across markets.\n\nBut like many other experts in the field, he believes the region’s overall direction is clear. Greener modes of transport are a key part of the sustainability visions set by governments, and mass adoption of electrified vehicles per market is “a matter of when, not if.”\n\nHaqparwar says during the current “transition” phase the region is witnessing a wider range of EVs enter its markets, confirming that manufacturers will continue to expand their EV portfolio.\n\n“This growth of supply, along with expansion of the required infrastructure, will gradually increase the demand in the Middle East,” he told Arab News. “I would expect EV sales to see more growth in the next five years.”\n\nAs desirable as the viability of EVs in the Middle East market may be, it is not without its challenges.\n\nIN NUMBERS * 33% Environmental damage caused by an automobile before it is sold and driven. * 3% Hybrid and EVs’ share of total new vehicle sales in KSA. * 8% Saudis who think EVs will be increasingly common in the future.\n\nOne of the main gaps exists in the regulatory framework, both at the base economy and local authority levels, according to Hajir of WSP Middle East.\n\nFor example, in Saudi Arabia, where EV rollout is still in its initial stages, updates to these regulatory frameworks are required to streamline certification processes and encourage uptake, she told Arab News.\n\nAdditionally, she cited global-supply chain issues and the consequent lag time in manufacturing as a major challenge currently facing vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThe delays are likely to have a knock-on effect on some of the immediate EV projects being implemented in the Middle East.\n\n“Average procurement and delivery of EVs can take anywhere between six and 18 months,” said Hajir, pointing out that adequate implementation planning and early engagement of both operators and manufacturers need to be considered by mobility service providers.\n\nThen there is the Middle East’s hot, arid climate, which might adversely affect the longevity of battery life in EVs. Hajir says more Middle East-centric data concerning the full impact of heat on EV batteries is urgently needed.\n\nFor this as well as many other reasons, internal combustion engines are certainly still going to be on our roads, says Haqparwar of BMW Group Middle East.

The facility is expected to produce 55,000 cars per year.\n\nThere is strong competition for a share of the GCC region’s EV market, with brands such as Tesla leading the charge and others including BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz in close pursuit.\n\nNoor Hajir, head of transport planning and mobility at WSP Middle East, says there are positive signals in the Gulf marketplace, with many developers, particularly those in Saudi Arabia, embracing greener alternatives and future mobility solutions such as EVs to help them achieve their future net-zero targets.\n\n“We’re seeing a trend of private developers leveraging EV charging stations as a branding and customer incentivization tool within assets such as major malls and business districts,” she said.\n\nStill, Hajir believes the region has a long way to go before the infrastructure required to make widespread private and public EV adoption a reality is in place.\n\n“The Middle East may be behind the curve compared with more developed economies in providing roadside infrastructure to facilitate and incentivize widespread private EV ownership, which relies heavily on public sector endorsement,” she told Arab News.\n\nBeyond the challenge of having enough charging stations, EVs must also tackle the region's host and arid climate. (AFP)\n\nDr. Hamid Haqparwar, managing director of BMW Group Middle East, said infrastructure development for EVs in the region varies from country to country, resulting in different rates of adoption across markets.\n\nBut like many other experts in the field, he believes the region’s overall direction is clear. Greener modes of transport are a key part of the sustainability visions set by governments, and mass adoption of electrified vehicles per market is “a matter of when, not if.”\n\nHaqparwar says during the current “transition” phase the region is witnessing a wider range of EVs enter its markets, confirming that manufacturers will continue to expand their EV portfolio.\n\n“This growth of supply, along with expansion of the required infrastructure, will gradually increase the demand in the Middle East,” he told Arab News. “I would expect EV sales to see more growth in the next five years.”\n\nAs desirable as the viability of EVs in the Middle East market may be, it is not without its challenges.\n\nIN NUMBERS * 33% Environmental damage caused by an automobile before it is sold and driven. * 3% Hybrid and EVs’ share of total new vehicle sales in KSA. * 8% Saudis who think EVs will be increasingly common in the future.\n\nOne of the main gaps exists in the regulatory framework, both at the base economy and local authority levels, according to Hajir of WSP Middle East.\n\nFor example, in Saudi Arabia, where EV rollout is still in its initial stages, updates to these regulatory frameworks are required to streamline certification processes and encourage uptake, she told Arab News.\n\nAdditionally, she cited global-supply chain issues and the consequent lag time in manufacturing as a major challenge currently facing vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThe delays are likely to have a knock-on effect on some of the immediate EV projects being implemented in the Middle East.\n\n“Average procurement and delivery of EVs can take anywhere between six and 18 months,” said Hajir, pointing out that adequate implementation planning and early engagement of both operators and manufacturers need to be considered by mobility service providers.\n\nThen there is the Middle East’s hot, arid climate, which might adversely affect the longevity of battery life in EVs. Hajir says more Middle East-centric data concerning the full impact of heat on EV batteries is urgently needed.\n\nFor this as well as many other reasons, internal combustion engines are certainly still going to be on our roads, says Haqparwar of BMW Group Middle East.

Every gallon (4.5 liters) of gasoline burned adds some 8,887 grams of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.\n\nSuch numbers raise the question of whether it is even possible for the titans of the automobile industry to significantly reduce their carbon footprints so that they can meet their environmental, social and governance criteria.\n\nFortunately, a surge in the popularity of EVs in the relatively affluent GCC countries is bringing the region closer to trends that characterize Western markets.\n\nGrowing by leaps and bounds over the past decade, the global EV market was valued at $370.86 billion in 2021, and it is expected to reach over $1.2 trillion by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, global sales of EVs have more than doubled to $6.6 million in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency, with green mobility making up 9 percent market share of the global car industry. This is more than double the share it commanded in 2020 and triple of what it had in 2019.\n\nIn the Middle East, interest in eco-friendly alternatives to the internal combustion engine vehicle is slowly growing as automobile manufacturers race to bring more EV models to the market every year.\n\nSaudi Arabia aims for at least 30 percent of its cars to be electric powered by 2030, following its pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2060. Last year, EV manufacturer Lucid announced a long-term plan to build the first international manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia, targeting 150,000 vehicles per year at the King Abdullah Economic City.\n\nSaudi Arabia is planning new electric vehicles production plants capable of building 150,000 models per year and an EV infrastructure to support them. (Madinah Municipality)\n\nMeanwhile, the UAE is pushing for 42,000 EVs to be on its streets within the next decade. To meet the rise in demand for green mobility, the UAE opened its first electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Dubai Industrial City last month, built at a total cost of $408 million.

As a result, the two countries put their forces along the border on high alert, but the next day the situation returned to normal.\n\n“We aren’t unconcerned about our borders. The tensions on Saturday were triggered by a misunderstanding,” said Enayatullah Khawarazmi, a spokesman for the Afghan Defence Ministry.\n\nThis is the second skirmish between the two countries since the Taliban took power in August last year.\n\nThe Iranian government is also very concerned about the security situation in Afghanistan following attacks on a Shia mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif and a Hazara school in Kabul, claimed by the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (IS-K), the local affiliate of the Islamic State group.\n\nA spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Saeed Khatibzadeh, yesterday said that the Taliban are unable to protect Afghan citizens, in particular Shias; for this reason, Tehran offered to lead the fight against terrorist groups and IS-K.\n\nIran President Ebrahim Raisi is quoted as saying that “Iran is ready to cooperate and use all its means to counter the threat of Takfiri terrorism and prevent recurrence of these tragedies.”\n\nThe Iranian embassy in Kabul noted that diplomatic efforts to develop a friendly relationship between the two countries will continue after Ramadan.\n\nAlthough Iran has not yet officially recognised the Taliban regime, it has accepted the appointment of three new Taliban officials at the Afghan embassy in Tehran.', 'image': 'https://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/1650720671195.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:26:59'}

This is because of the issues that are closely intertwined with its own security and stability, such as countering the threats posed by terrorist outfits, stopping the flow of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers, ending drug smuggling, and resolving disputes related to the construction of dams and water sharing between the two countries.\n\nSince the Taliban reassumed power in the country last summer, Iran has intensified its efforts to create a supportive atmosphere in Afghanistan to enable it to maintain its interests in Kabul. At the same time, however, Iran fears that strengthened ties with the Taliban will make Afghanistan the source and center of greater pressure on it. It seems that, overall, Iranian efforts to initiate confidence-building measures with the Taliban and forge closer ties with the group could soon face more challenges and crises.\n\nTensions between the two countries over water resources were heightened when Afghanistan built the Kamal Khan Dam on the Helmand River, located on the border between the two countries. This river, which is considered the most important water source for Afghanistan, is also one of the most crucial tributaries flowing into the Hamun Lake, whose shores are situated in both Iran and Afghanistan. Tehran believes the establishment of this dam will reduce the flow of water into Iranian territories, especially in Sistan and Balochistan Province. As a result of this concern, Tehran has continued to exert pressure on Afghanistan to release the water behind the dam. Increasing tensions over ever more scarce water resources have, in recent times, triggered fierce clashes between Iranian and Afghan forces. These could easily have escalated into a genuine crisis if the two countries had not taken rapid action to contain them.\n\nAnother challenge that could obstruct Tehran’s efforts at promoting greater openness with Afghanistan is the question of Afghan refugees in Iran. This issue has overshadowed relations between the two countries since the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, which prompted millions of Afghans to flee across the border. Due to the relative political and economic stability Afghanistan witnessed in the subsequent years, particularly when compared with the mistreatment and dire economic conditions suffered by Afghan refugees in Iran in the same period, most returned home.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of US forces and the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021, however, the number of Afghan refugees doubled, hitting 5 million, according to the Iranian Foreign Ministry. Iranian officials and the public believe that this enormous number of refugees places a great economic and security burden on the country, especially considering the deteriorating economic and living conditions being experienced due to US sanctions.\n\nThis issue ratcheted up tensions between the two countries after an Afghan refugee was this month accused of killing two Iranian clerics in the city of Mashhad. This incident sparked new waves of violence against Afghans in Iran, with video footage showing several refugees being beaten and insulted, arrested on false charges and sent to live in squalid camps, where they are detained in dreadful conditions and face horrendous mistreatment. Tehran insists, however, that the footage and reports are fabricated and aim to sabotage relations between the two countries.\n\nDespite Iran’s assurances, such incidents prompted the Afghan Foreign Ministry to express its concern about the situation faced by Afghan refugees in Iran and call on Tehran to issue the necessary instructions to its security services to ensure their proper treatment. In Kabul, demonstrations were held in front of the Iranian Embassy in protest at the beatings and brutal persecution faced by Afghan refugees in Iran. In the city of Herat, protesters hurled stones at the Iranian Consulate, set fire to its main gate and destroyed surveillance cameras. Although the Taliban had, in September 2021, banned any unlicensed demonstrations throughout Afghanistan, they turned a blind eye to the protests in Herat and Kabul.\n\nAll these points indicate increased tensions in the relationship between the two countries and suggest that the Taliban are dissatisfied with Iran’s handling of several issues that concern both countries, including the issue of refugees. It also seems that the Taliban are intent on taking steps to counter Iranian influence in Afghanistan. In mid-April, the Afghan security forces arrested and interrogated Yarmohammad Rahmati, the head of the Tebyan cultural center in Kabul. Two days before his arrest, he participated in a gathering in front of the Iranian Embassy to defend what he called the strong and amicable relations between Iran and Afghanistan. While the Taliban did not disclose the reason for Rahmati’s arrest, the move signaled the group’s opposition to that recent gathering, during which flowers were scattered in front of the Iranian Embassy. Some Afghan analysts also suggest that the group is suspicious of the center’s activities, given its Iranian backing.\n\nIn addition to these challenges, Pashtuns, who make up the majority of the Afghan population, strongly distrust Iran and often work to impede its tireless efforts at extending its influence in the country. Even the Hazaras, strongly backed by Iran due to their common cultural, sectarian and linguistic denominators, could resort to changing their policies toward Tehran to stave off disputes with the Taliban and militant groups that recently targeted their educational centers in Kabul. The Hazaras may seek to change the widespread impression among the Afghan public that they are Iran’s proxies, serving its interests and implementing its agenda in Afghanistan.\n\nIran, which is keen to forge stable relations with its eastern neighbor, has thus far resorted to diplomatic channels to contain the crisis. It has already begun blaming enemies for the tensions between the two countries, including accusing the Iranian opposition Mujahedin-e-Khalq movement of posting fabricated videos about the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Iran, as well as blaming regional and Western powers for fueling the tensions between Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, Iran’s insistence on a government in Kabul that includes all Afghan factions as a condition for its recognition of the Taliban — in addition to some Iranian officials ratcheting up hostile rhetoric against the Taliban, accusing the group of being inefficient administrators, especially after the recent bombings that targeted the Hazaras — may further complicate the crisis and create additional divisions and disunity in relations between the two countries.', 'image': 'https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/b-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:53'}

Dr. Mohammed Al-Sulami\n\nIn addition to these challenges, Pashtuns, who make up the majority of the Afghan population, strongly distrust Iran and often work to impede its tireless efforts at extending its influence in the country. Even the Hazaras, strongly backed by Iran due to their common cultural, sectarian and linguistic denominators, could resort to changing their policies toward Tehran to stave off disputes with the Taliban and militant groups that recently targeted their educational centers in Kabul. The Hazaras may seek to change the widespread impression among the Afghan public that they are Iran’s proxies, serving its interests and implementing its agenda in Afghanistan.\n\nIran, which is keen to forge stable relations with its eastern neighbor, has thus far resorted to diplomatic channels to contain the crisis. It has already begun blaming enemies for the tensions between the two countries, including accusing the Iranian opposition Mujahedin-e-Khalq movement of posting fabricated videos about the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Iran, as well as blaming regional and Western powers for fueling the tensions between Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, Iran’s insistence on a government in Kabul that includes all Afghan factions as a condition for its recognition of the Taliban — in addition to some Iranian officials ratcheting up hostile rhetoric against the Taliban, accusing the group of being inefficient administrators, especially after the recent bombings that targeted the Hazaras — may further complicate the crisis and create additional divisions and disunity in relations between the two countries.\n\nDr. Mohammed Al-Sulami is president of the International Institute for Iranian Studies (Rasanah).

Police sources have described Pizzi as a man who appears to have grown in influence among the Montreal Mafia over the past decade. The agreement reached with the new owner is detailed in a decision made on April 14 by the RACJ to suspend the bar’s liquor licence despite the change in ownership. It describes how the previous owner was summoned to appear before the board since November 2019 on a request from the Montreal police.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content “The most troubling aspect in the case (was) the presence and the hold, by certain individuals tied to the highest spheres of organized crime in Montreal, over control of the establishment,” Marc Savard, the president of the RACJ, wrote in his decision approving the agreement. Savard noted that a Montreal police investigator corroborated the new owner’s testimony that he has no connections with Salvatore Infantino, the bar’s previous owner, beyond the sale of the bar, and has no ties to organized crime. Infantino is also among the names of eight people who are not allowed on the premises. During the summer of 2016, Pizzi underwent a bail hearing at the Montreal courthouse following his arrest in Project Clemenza, an RCMP investigation into alleged drug traffickers tied to the Montreal Mafia. Infantino testified during the bail hearing in support of Pizzi’s release. He described himself as a childhood friend of Pizzi’s and told the court he was surprised to learn Pizzi was alleged to have been tied to $2.3 million used to finance five shipments of cocaine that were to be smuggled into Canada.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The charges against Pizzi were dropped a year later when the Crown decided it would no longer prosecute cases related to Project Clemenza. Shortly after he was released on bail, an attempt was made on Pizzi’s life on Aug. 8, 2016, while he was driving along Grande-Allée Ave. in Montreal. A hit man who became an informant and testified during the murder trial of Marie-Josée Viau and Guy Dion last year said that Pizzi was among a list of people that Salvatore Scoppa, the leader of a Calabrian clan in the Montreal Mafia, had sought to have killed. Among a long list of events the Montreal police cited when it asked that Infantino appear before the RACJ, was a dinner held on May 29, 2021, at a restaurant in Rivière-des-Prairies called Prima Luna “where several influential members of organized crime gathered for a soirée.” The gathering was held in the restaurant in contravention of COVID-19 measures. Pizzi was reportedly in attendance that night as well as Montreal Mafia leader Francesco Del Balso and longtime members of the Hells Angels. The owners of Prima Luna are scheduled to have a hearing before the RACJ next month to answer questions about the gathering. Other events mentioned include an arson fire set in the same building on Maurice Duplessis Blvd. in 2016, when the business was known as Café Liana, and an attempted murder on Feb. 4, 2019. pcherry@postmedia.com More On This Topic Man involved in hit on alleged Montreal Mafioso is denied parole Informant says Scoppa brothers wanted to eliminate Sicilians in Montreal Mafia\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nMontreal Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

What they have to understand is if Quebec is bilingual, unfortunately the attraction in North America to English will be so strong it will be a matter of time before we don’t speak French in Quebec and we become Louisiana.” Legault was commenting on news that two new minority language rights parties, one to be called the Canadian Party of Quebec (CaPQ) and the other Mouvement Québec, are getting organized in time to field candidates in the fall general election. Neither have been officially authorized by Élections Quebec, but have applications to obtain official party status. Both plan to run candidates throughout Quebec, but are targeting ridings in Montreal, the Townships and Outaouais because of the pockets of English-speaking Quebecers.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The announcement of the creation of the Canadian Party of Quebec was done via a press release published overnight Monday by Eastern Townships language activist Colin Standish. Former mayoralty candidate Balarama Holness announced last week that he was creating Mouvement Québec. “Yes, the Canadian Party of Quebec/Parti canadien du Québec will be an unapologetically federalist party that tirelessly works for minority rights, socioeconomic justice and linguistic harmony,” Standish said. The party’s platform will be based on six principles. They will be “rights are rights are rights, respecting the integrity of the Canadian constitution, bilingualism, educational choice, prosperity for all Quebecers, and rapprochement and reconciliation.”\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The group says it intends to challenge what it describes as Quebec’s political orthodoxy and offers to “fill the void” felt by minority voters in the wake of overhauls of language legislation at the National Assembly (Bill 96) and in Ottawa and other legislation, such as Bill 21 on state secularism. “The time has come to offer a voice to the voiceless,” especially Quebecers who feel betrayed and abandoned by the Coalition Avenir Québec and the Quebec Liberal Party,” Standish said. The news took the traditional parties by surprise, but mostly risks rocking the boat of the struggling Liberals. With Liberal Leader Dominique Anglade absent from the legislature for a speaking engagement Tuesday, it was up to Liberal house leader André Fortin to field the questions. He rapidly shifted the Liberal line of attack to a warning about vote-splitting.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content “You may well end up with more people elected from the Coalition Avenir Québec,” Fortin told reporters. “If you want people here, in the assembly, who represent your views, if you want people who oppose those bills, then the Liberal Party represents your views.” Reached Tuesday, Holness launched a few arrows at the new party, which will now be competing for similar voters with his party. “It remains to be seen whether Montrealers will be inspired by Colin,” Holness said. “I think their policies are connected to the current political climate, but are they connected to the people? I don’t think so. “He’s from the Eastern Townships, has never lived in Montreal and won’t be campaigning in Montreal because he doesn’t live here. For me, this (other party) is a lot of noise.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content He noted his organization has a track record of being able to organize and debate issues from the last municipal campaign. “Anyone can go and register a party and say we are against Bill 96,” Holness said. “I don’t think they have the bandwidth, the personnel and the credibility to make the kind of impact Mouvement Montréal had.” Later, in an interview with the Montreal Gazette, Standish said he did not want to get into a feud with Holness, but noted his party’s policies are the result of discussions and debates in the community. “We feel they are going to resonate with all Quebecers, French, English-speaking, newcomers and Indigenous. We have our plan. We’re confident. This is not a fly-by-night idea for us. It is intellectually and morally and legally sound principles.” He challenged Legault’s views that French is in decline, noting 80 per cent of Quebecers are mother-tongue-French. “The decline of French in Quebec is a myth,” Standish said. Standish said the Canadian Party of Quebec will be officially launched some time in mid-May. pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/philipauthier More On This Topic Voters will have another option this fall: the Canadian Party of Quebec Montreal needs voice in National Assembly, Holness says in previewing new party\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nMontreal Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Try refreshing your browser, or One of the criticisms of the order establishing the inquiry, though, is that it allows the government to refuse publicly release documents or information based on national security concerns. The order also instructs the inquiry to look into the conduct of the protesters, but not the government. Mendicino responded to that claim by saying that “the judge can look into the conduct of police enforcement.” The conduct of police is a far cry from looking into the actions or the failures of federal, provincial and municipal politicians.

In order to do that, Justice Rouleau needs access to documents covered by cabinet confidence,” Chong said. “Will the Prime Minister, will the government, waive cabinet confidence?” Mendicino, a former Crown prosecutor, reminded the Commons that people were arrested as a result of these protests. What he didn’t say was that no one has faced charges that required the Emergencies Act. He also spoke of working “in co-operation with the judge” leading the inquiry without saying that the government would grant full access to documents.

Try refreshing your browser, or CN says search for francophone, Quebec-based director has begun Back to video Canadian National Railway said Tuesday it’s begun a search for a francophone Quebec-based board member after sparking controversy for failing to nominate a single French-speaking director. The new board member will be appointed “in the coming months” following a “rigorous process,” Canada’s largest railroad said Tuesday in a statement. This will be in addition to CN’s new Canadian-born chief executive, Tracy Robinson, a three-decade industry veteran who recently relocated to Montreal after being hired in late January. As a former crown corporation until its privatization in 1995, Montreal-based CN is subject to Canada’s Official Languages Act — though the legislation doesn’t govern the company’s board.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content “CN, headquartered in Montreal for over 100 years, and its Board of Directors, is very proud of and respects the company’s rich history in Quebec, where the official language is French,” chairman Robert Pace said in the statement. CN’s board slate for 2022, disclosed in a regulatory filing last week, includes several former railroad executives, none of whom are based in Quebec. The move drew scorn from the $420-billion Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, a major CN shareholder, which criticized the company for ignoring qualified francophone candidates based in its home province. Language skills of CEOs at major Quebec-based companies have become a sensitive issue after Air Canada boss — and native English speaker — Michael Rousseau told reporters in November it was a “testament to Montreal” that he could live here without speaking French. Rousseau had earlier delivered an English-only speech to the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Canada’s biggest railroad had planned to have at least one francophone director in 2022, but political events decided otherwise. CN appointed Jean Charest as independent director in January, only for the former Quebec premier to resign April 1 when he decided to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. Board makeup is quickly turning into a political issue. Companies that are subject to the Official Languages Act, such as CN and Air Canada, should be forced by Ottawa to have a minimum proportion of francophone directors, Conservative Party official languages critic Joël Godin said Tuesday. “We must have a tool to force federally chartered companies to have francophones,” said Godin, who is vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages,.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The Conservatives are preparing an amendment to the bill that aims to modernize the Official Languages Act, Godin also said. Lawmakers are currently debating the minimum proportion of francophones and the mechanism to impose this requirement. Godin’s position is consistent with that of the chair of the official languages committee, Liberal MP René Arseneault. Businesses subject to the Official Languages Act, “no matter how independent,” should represent “the linguistic demographics of the country,” said Arseneault, who represents the Madawaska-Restigouche riding. This would mean making it mandatory that “at the very least” a quarter of board of members be francophone. Issues surrounding the use of French at CN go beyond the boardroom.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Officials at the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference wrote to Robinson earlier this month to highlight “multiple problems regarding the use and quality of the French language in the workplace,” La Presse reported last week. Employees who say they’re uncomfortable working in in English “are subject to pressure, threats of disciplinary action and a treatment that could sometimes amount to retaliation,” the union said in its letter. Separately, CN said Tuesday that adjusted diluted profit rose seven per cent in the first quarter to $1.32 a share. Quarterly revenue advanced five per cent to $3.71 billion. Citing “challenging” operating conditions and “worldwide economic uncertainty,” CN also cut its full-year financial outlook. Adjusted diluted profit for 2022 is now expected to rise by 15 per cent to 20 per cent, the company said, down from an earlier target of 20 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Robinson addressed the language situation on a late-afternoon call with financial analysts, her first since taking over — and even spent a couple of minutes reading a statement in heavily accented French. The new CEO said she’s been practicing her French since moving to Montreal two months ago. “It’s a priority for me and for CN,” Robinson said in French. “I want to make sure that anyone can communicate with CN in the official language of their choice. It’s also important for us to have francophone directors.” Robinson concluded her prepared remarks by thanking her predecessor, Quebecer Jean-Jacques Ruest, for his 25 years of service at CN and his “exemplary leadership.” “Merci beaucoup JJ,” she said.

Back to video The leaders of both parties have expressed an interest in working together if Ford wins the most seats, but not a majority, and the Liberals are actively pursuing the NDP as they try to scratch their way back to power from third place. On Monday, NDP leader Andrea Horwath unveiled her party’s platform. It’s filled with promises to hire 30,000 nurses, 20,000 teachers and education workers, 10,000 personal support workers, and planks that will have the government spending until the cows come home on every project imaginable – except highways, roads, and other vital infrastructure. In days past, Liberals of the centrist variety — the people who didn’t want to go too far left or too far right — would’ve looked at the NDP platform in horror. The reckless spending, the promises to tax successful people and businesses into oblivion — or prompt them to leave the province –would have made them think twice about offering any praise.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Not current Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca, who issued a statement effectively, saying his Liberals are just like the NDP. “I see a lot of the ideas Ontario Liberals have already announced as part of our Liberal plan. I can tell you there are also some proposals that we had already decided to include in our platform but not yet released,” Del Duca said, while adding there is a lot in the NDP plan he could work with. It sounded like a love letter to Horwath’s party! We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or If Del Duca isn’t courting NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, he’s definitely courting her voters. Like Kathleen Wynne before him, Del Duca has decided that the path to power lies in being more like the NDP and abandoning the middle ground where the majority of the electorate sits.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content It’s a strange plan for him to follow. Between the 2014 and 2018 elections, the Ontario Liberals lost roughly 740,000 votes. The PC Party picked up 821,000 and the NDP increased by 784,000 votes. Obviously, far more people came out to vote in 2018 when the province saw a 58% voter participation rate compared to just 51% in 2014, but more people also went to Ford’s PCs than Horwath’s NDP. Why not target them? “You don’t understand,” said one top Liberal recently. “We need to own the progressive side and don’t really care what is happening with Tory voters.” That much is evident from their campaign promises. Del Duca isn’t attempting to reach disaffected Ford voters so much as people who voted for Horwath and the NDP and think she’s done a bad job as Opposition leader.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Horwath has certainly failed on that front. If she were a competent Opposition leader, Ford wouldn’t be entering the election leading in the polls. Yet, in focusing on Horwath, Del Duca is, in effect, auditioning for the job of leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition while leaving Ford a lot of room to manoeuvre. He says he’s focused on Doug Ford and replacing him as premier, but Del Duca is aiming squarely at the NDP. The Liberals are hoping that they can steal enough NDP votes to find a way back to power, but barring that, they’ll look for an NDP-Liberal coalition to seal the deal. “I’m prepared to have conversations,” Del Duca said a month ago regarding coalitions talks. When the polls close June 2, we’ll find out if voters want Del Duca to have those conversations or if they’ll side with the stability of a second Ford term rather than put an NDP-Liberal coalition into place on Parliament Hill and at Queen’s Park.

Try refreshing your browser, or HUNTER: $250Gs for info on suspected killer Abilaziz Mohamed Back to video But look, there he is: No. 1 with a bullet on Toronto’s Most Wanted list. Mohamed is wanted for first-degree murder in the Oct. 13, 2021 shooting death of hard-working Scarborough father-of-five Craig MacDonald in the parking lot of a Boston Pizza in the Cinemart Dr.-Milner Ave. area. MacDonald, 43, died later in hospital. He had worked at Providence Health for the previous 25 years and was the manager of maintenance and plant services. Abilaziz Mohamed allegedly put an end to all that. And why did this good man die? He was watching his beloved Toronto Maple Leafs edge the Montreal Canadiens 2-1 and got into a dispute inside the watering hole. According to police, Mohamed apparently decided that such effrontery could not go unpunished, so in a cowardly way, he followed MacDonald to the parking lot, allegedly pulled out his gun, and shot him.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Detectives zeroed in on Mohamed pretty quickly, and now they need your help to put the alleged killer behind bars. And the Bolo Program will pay as much as $250,000 for information that leads to his arrest and conviction. Bolo announced on Tuesday its list of the 25 most wanted criminals in Canada. More than half come from the GTA with our pal Mohamed leading the hit parade. And they’ll pay big bucks if you drop a dime on any of these alleged killers. Most wanted programs have been around since the days when posters were a fixture of post offices and other government buildings. The initiative got a massive boost when the FBI came out with its 10 Most Wanted list on March 14, 1950. The tool proved effective, spilling over the border and resulting in the capture of thousands of killers, conmen, pedophiles and a host of other nefarious villains.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content And they are effective. Too often, cops see the public as a nuisance and a hindrance to their investigations. A lot of police services (particularly in Canada) guard the most pedestrian information like crown jewels, instead of something to be shared with the public. That’s often when investigations hit a brick wall. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or For the public, if some guy pulls the trigger once, it gets a whole lot easier on the second throw to put a bullet in some other innocent. That’s the story with a lot of them. Homicide detectives say they believe Mohamed is still in the GTA. MacDonald’s family described him as an “ordinary guy” doing a “very ordinary thing when his life ended. “It could happen to anyone because my brother was just a regular guy, and I’m telling you, everyone loved him,” his sister, Drema, told Global News last year. The quicker cops get these alleged killers off the street, the safer everyone will be. Abilaziz Mohamed, 32, of Toronto, is described as 5-foot-10, 190 pounds, with a stocky build, black hair, brown eyes, and a full beard and moustache. He is believed to be armed and dangerous.

It has raised food prices and energy costs worldwide and upended the post-Cold War security balance in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the small city of Toretsk in the Donbas, residents are struggling to survive, collecting rainwater for cleaning and washing up and fervently hoping for an end to the fighting.\n\n“It’s bad. Very bad. Hopeless,” said Andriy Cheromushkin. “You feel so helpless that you don’t know what you should do or shouldn’t do. Because if you want to do something, you need some money; and there is no money now.”\n\nIn its latest assessment of the fighting, the British Defense Ministry described Russian advances and heavy fighting in the Donbas, with one town, Kreminna, reportedly falling after days of street-to-street fighting.\n\nIn Mariupol, the besieged city seen as crucial to the fight for the east, authorities said Tuesday that the Russian forces hit the Azovstal steel plant with 35 airstrikes over the past 24 hours. The plant is the last known redoubt of Ukrainian fighters in the city, and some of the civilians sheltering there were wounded in the strikes, officials said.\n\n“Russia has drastically intensified strikes over the past 24 hours and is using heavy bunker bombs,” Petro Andryushchenko, advisor to Mariupol mayor, told The Associated Press by phone. “The number of those wounded will be clear once the rubble is cleared.”\n\nHe also accused Russian forces of shelling a route it had offered as an escape corridor from the steel mill and its warren of tunnels and bunkers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond Mariupol, local officials said at least nine people were killed and several more wounded by Russian attacks on towns and cities in eastern and southern Ukraine. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces “continue to deliberately fire at civilians and to destroy critical infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine’s General Staff also said Russian forces shelled Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city that lies outside the Donbas but has seen significant attacks as Moscow seeks full control of the region. Ukrainian forces struck back in the Kherson region in the south.\n\nWith the potentially pivotal battle for the east underway, the US and its NATO allies are scrambling to get artillery and other heavy weaponry to that area in time to make a difference.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said her government decided on Monday to clear the delivery of Gepard self-propelled armored anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, though she didn’t give details. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced mounting pressure, including from within his governing coalition, to approve sending heavy weapons such as tanks and other armored vehicles to Ukraine.\n\nAustin, the American defense secretary, noted Tuesday that more than 30 allies and partners have joined the US in sending security assistance to Ukraine and more than $5 billion worth of equipment has been committed.\n\nAmid the talk of arms shipments, diplomatic efforts to seek an end to the fighting also continued. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday and called again for a cease-fire. The UN chief is scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin later.\n\nBut Lavrov noted the Western promises of weapons to Ukraine and said that “if this continues, then of course the negotiations will hardly have any kind of result, but I repeat once again that we are committed to a negotiated solution.”\n\nA day earlier, Lavrov warned weapons from Western countries “will be a legitimate target,” and accused NATO of “pouring oil on the fire” with its support for Ukraine, according to a transcript of his televised remarks on the Foreign Ministry’s website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLavrov also warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.”\n\nPutin has cited NATO’s expansion and the risk that Kyiv could join the alliance as reasons for his invasion.\n\nUK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey rejected Lavrov’s accusations of NATO aggression as “utter nonsense,” and Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the Russian minister’s reference to nuclear conflict was not constructive.\n\n“A nuclear war cannot be won and it shouldn’t be fought,” Kirby told CNN during an interview from Germany, where he was traveling with Austin. “That kind of rhetoric is clearly not called for in the current scenario. What is called for is Mr. Putin ending this war.”\n\nRussia’s invasion has worried several countries in eastern Europe that fear they could be next. Those concerns grew in Moldova after a Russian commander said that securing southern Ukraine would open the way to the Moldovan separatist region of Transnistria. On Tuesday, police said explosions knocked down two powerful radio antennas at a facility close to the Ukrainian border, the second series of explosions reported in the region in as many days.\n\nWashington has warned previously that Russian forces could launch “false-flag” operations to create a pretext for invading the territory of other nations. Russian officials have rejected such charges.\n\nElsewhere, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi visited the Chernobyl nuclear plant to deliver equipment, conduct radiological assessments and restore safeguards monitoring systems after tanks and troops churned up highly contaminated soil there in the early hours of Russia’s invasion in February. His visit comes on the anniversary of the disaster at the plant in 1986, the world’s worst nuclear accident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the largest ground conflict since World War II, Britain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began — far above the 1,351 deaths acknowledged by Moscow. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective.”\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nThe West hopes that boosting arms supplies will help the remaining fighters repel Russia’s invasion.\n\nAs he opened the meeting in Germany, Austin sought to reassure Kyiv: “We know, and you should know, that all of us have your back and that’s why we’re here today — to strengthen the arsenal of Ukrainian democracy.”", 'image': 'https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2022/04/AP22115653629167-1-e1650982412109-1024x640.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:46'}

Internationally, the Brazilian leader is now treated as a pariah – as illustrated by last October’s G20 summit in Rome where he was unable to secure a meeting with any leader except for Italy’s Sergio Mattarella, who, as president of the host country, was obliged to meet with all those present.\n\nIn fact, Bolsonaro has looked increasingly isolated on the international stage ever since Donald Trump lost the US elections in 2020. He has diplomatically distanced himself from President Joe Biden, who has criticized the Brazilian president over the preservation of the Amazon, and even threatened Brazil with economic sanctions.\n\nBolsonaro’s aggressive extractivist policies and attitude towards the COVID-19 pandemic, which many believe contributed to making Brazil the country with the world’s second highest death toll, have also led to his ostracization.\n\nHaving lost Trump’s support, Bolsonaro appears to be aiming to fill the void by attempting to create a relationship with Putin. Bolsonaro’s actions were called into question in mid-February, when he made an official visit to Moscow amid rising tensions in the region and in the face of warnings from the Biden administration. His decision drew particular concern as it appeared to jeopardize the country’s expected stance of condemnation.\n\nAlthough Brazil condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine during the United Nations General Assembly vote on March 2, its position appeared inconsistent with that of Bolsonaro, who, only days earlier, had stated that Brazil should remain neutral, citing the importance of Russian fertilizers as a reason for his position.\n\n“We have to be very responsible, because we have special agreements with Russia. Brazil depends on fertilizers”, he told the press, noting that “the fertilizer issue is sacred.” Brazil purchased US$ 3.5bn in fertilizers from Russia in 2021, equivalent to 23% of the total imported, making Russia its main source of fertilizers.\n\nBolsonaro also took advantage of the situation to press for the approval of a bill that would allow “the exploitation of mineral, water and organic resources on Indigenous lands”, arguing that it would solve Brazil’s dependence on Russian potash. It has also been revealed that Bolsonaro used his trip to Russia to ask Putin for support in advancing Brazil’s nuclear submarine project, after the US refused to cooperate following lengthy negotiations.\n\nBut Bolsonaro’s true interest in forging an alliance with Putin probably goes beyond fertilizers and nuclear submarines. For seasoned observers, he is likely to be much more concerned with guaranteeing access to Russian disinformation networks ahead of the October elections.\n\nBolsonaro took one of his sons, Carlos, as part of his presidential entourage on his trip to Moscow. The presence of Carlos, a municipal councilor, caused indignation, leading the federal Supreme Court to examine the matter. His presence also raised concerns due to Carlos’s alleged involvement in the so-called “office of hate”, a digital disinformation network linked to the Brazilian government. This suggests Bolsonaro has cyber-strategic interests in Russia – as former Brazilian congressman Jean Wyllys contended.\n\nBolsonaro has denied the existence of this “digital militia”, which reportedly spreads fake news from the presidential palace, and is currently under investigation by the federal police. Bolsonaro claimed he needed Carlos in Russia to manage his online presence. “He helps me a lot with social media […] He does an exceptional job, hence the witch hunt against him. Hence the fabrication of the ‘office of hate’,” he said in his weekly livestream on February 24.\n\nIn view of Russia’s involvement in the 2016 US elections, it’s not surprising that Bolsonaro is interested in friendly relations with Putin. Russia hacked the campaign of Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, and disseminated propaganda via the internet and social media.\n\nBolsonaro employed similar tactics – possibly aided by the same agents – during his bid for president in 2018. Bolsonaro’s son, Eduardo, a congressman, claimed they had the help of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, whom he met extensively throughout the campaign. Bannon denied involvement, but declared support for Bolsonaro, calling him “brilliant” and “sophisticated”.\n\nRegardless of any formal association, the extensive ties between the Bolsonaros and Bannon show that the man who helped take Trump to the White House provided, at the very least, “informal advice” to the family. Last August, Eduardo met Bannon in the US, a meeting in which they both confirmed a partnership to re-elect Bolsonaro this year.\n\nDespite the historic differences and geographical distance between Russia and Brazil, their current leaders share similar philosophies. Both Putin and Bolsonaro see themselves as ‘strongmen’ and both seem enthralled by what their countries once were. Putin is increasingly obsessed with restoring Russia to former glories. And while Brazil hasn’t reveled in the same grandeur as the Soviet Union or the Russian Empire, Bolsonaro rose to power on promises that he would restore “order” in Brazil, a nod to the repressive military dictatorship that ruled between 1964 and 1985.\n\nBolsonaro just praised Colonel Carlos Brilhante Ustra, a member of the military government who in 2008 was convicted of torture and kidnapping. It wasn’t the first time. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has hailed the bloodthirsty colonel as a personal hero before. This time, he cited Ustra while promoting the notion that he is engaged in a fight of “good against evil”, not of “the Right against the Left”.\n\nPutin has certainly shown interest in strengthening alliances in Latin America – sometimes across ideological lines. Just days before Bolsonaro arrived, the Kremlin hosted Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, a Left-leaning politician and longtime Kirchnerist. Also in February, Russia sent its deputy prime minister to Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, countries whose authoritarian, socialist governments have long aligned with and depended on Moscow’s support.\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether Russia will continue to invest in this rapprochement with Latin America amid its increasing – and unexpected – difficulties in Ukraine.\n\nIt is also unclear whether Putin favors Bolsonaro over frontrunner Lula, who has placed greater emphasis on forging relationships with the global south during his presidency. This includes strengthening ties with fellow BRICS countries – Russia, India, China and South Africa. Lula met with the Russian ambassador, Alexey Labetskiy, as recently as October, to discuss the future of the regional bloc.\n\nIn fact, Lula has avoided expressly denouncing Putin or Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. On March 3, Lula condemned the war, while also seemingly criticizing conflicts started by Western nations. “I am and will be against all wars and any invasion of one country by another country, whether in the Middle East, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, anywhere on the planet. I will always defend peace and the sovereignty of each nation in the face of external aggression”, Lula wrote on Twitter.\n\nLula and Putin are no strangers. While Russia and Brazil do not have strong historical ties, the relationship between the two countries deepened under Lula’s leadership (2003–10).

But the evidence of most wars in history is that they are also too serious to be left to the politicians. This failing is not yet evident in Ukraine only because fighting is still raging on the battlefields of the Donbas and is likely to escalate.\n\nBut it should already be clear that the end of the war, if it comes at all, is more likely to be brought about by politicians – as difficult as that might be – and not by soldiers because the chances of either Russia or Ukraine winning a decisive victory have already disappeared.\n\nThe key question now is how and when the fighting will cease – or have the chances of a compromise peace already been overwhelmed by the sheer momentum of military conflict and the hatred it inspires?\n\nBottomless self-deception\n\nBizarrely, the main points in dispute have probably been decided. Russia is never going to conquer Ukraine because its forces do not have the strength to do so in the face of fierce and united Ukrainian resistance supplied with arms by the Nato states. This should have been self-evident to President Vladimir Putin long before he launched his disastrous invasion on 24 February, but his capacity for self-deception appears bottomless.\n\nBut it is equally unlikely that Ukraine will defeat Russia and drive its forces out of Ukrainian territory, as some politicians are now recommending as a war aim, however many weapons systems it receives from the West.\n\nRussia is unlikely to repeat the same amateurish mistakes it made in the first two months of the war when it fragmented its inadequate forces so none of their attacks were strong enough to succeed.\n\nPutin falsely claimed then that he had only invaded because Russia faced an existential threat. But his gigantic blunder turned this largely imaginary threat into a reality, enabling Putin – with his full control of all Russian media outlets – to persuade Russians that they now have no choice but to fight. Western sanctions are a double-edged sword because, though they do great economic damage, they are a collective punishment inflicted on all 145 million Russians who feel that they are left with no choice but to rally to the flag.\n\nA divided, frozen, fragmented conflict\n\nRussia’s enemies show an understandable reluctance to let Putin off the hook by relaxing the pressure on him or giving him an escape route out of the quagmire into which he has plunged his country. “There is an unfortunate dilemma,” a senior European diplomat is quoted as saying by the Washington Post. “The problem is that if it [the war] ends now, there is a kind of time for Russia to regroup and it will restart, under this or another pretext. Putin is not going to give up his goals.”\n\nEven a military stalemate is not necessarily in the interests of East European states near the conflict zone. “This is a major issue for us,” says a senior diplomat from one of the countries bordering Ukraine. “A divided, frozen, fragmented conflict in Ukraine is a very bad deal for us. An active Ukraine-Nato relationship is crucial for the Black Sea region.” Without Nato backing, he believed that there was every prospect of unchecked Russian aggression in the future.\n\nIt is easy to see why those who want to fight Russia to a finish now feel that their moment has come, but their policies are full of risks because they contain a number of contradictions. They assume that Russia is powerful enough to pose a serious threat to its neighbours, but at the same time so weak that it can be permanently defeated on the battlefield. They portray Russia as being under the total control of an autocrat in the Kremlin cut off from reality and spoon-fed only good news by his servile advisers. But this same half-crazed and ill-advised dictator is expected to behave with sensible restraint when it comes to widening the war or using nuclear weapons.\n\nThis hawkish stance is easy enough for powers outside Ukraine because it is the Ukrainians who will be doing the fighting. Those who glibly call for total victory over Russia are being as unrealistic as Putin was two months ago when he ordered the invasion of Ukraine in expectation of a walkover.\n\nShort of military manpower\n\nThis lack of realism is masked for the moment because Russia is still trying to make at least some territorial gains by taking Mariupol and the half-ruined cities in the Donbas, and the opportunity for a counter-attack has not yet arrived. But there are worrying signs that the Ukrainians and their Western allies are taking their own triumphalist propaganda too literally and acting as if it were all true.\n\nThe Russian army is likely to fight more skilfully in the next few months, if only because it will almost inevitably do better than its initial feeble performance. For instance, Russia has been accused of pursuing the same ruthless tactics as those used by the Syrian government backed by Russian airpower against the armed opposition after the 2011 uprising. These were to blockade rebel-held urban areas, bombard but not assault them, allow much of the surviving civilian population to flee, but seal off hostile areas. This approach worked well, cutting down on Syrian army casualties and confining enemy fighters to small islands of territory where they were effectively incarcerated with little hope of escape.\n\nSurprisingly, the Russians did not use these successful tactics in their abortive invasion of northern Ukraine, probably because they were short of military manpower. But as the second phase of the war opens in Donbas, Russian forces reportedly outnumber the Ukrainians by three to one, allowing Putin to order the blockade of the vast Mariupol steel works.\n\nPutin’s posture\n\nOverall, the war in Ukraine is beginning to look more and more like Syria: a military and political stalemate with limited chances of breaking the deadlock. Too many players with too many different interests are involved to bring the conflict to an end unless Russia and the US are determined to do so – and there is little sign so far of that happening.\n\nLook at Putin’s posture, like some King of Kings in a Persian miniature, as he receives news of the capture of Mariupol from his fawning defence minister. He does not look like a man conscious that earlier this year he made one of the most catastrophic misjudgments in Russian history.\n\nNot that President Joe Biden, feebly trying to get a grip on events, or Boris Johnson, endlessly seeking to divert public attention from his latest domestic scandal, look like the sort of people you want to see in charge of defusing the worst crisis in Europe since 1945.\n\nIn the Middle East these half-frozen wars can go on for decades, but I doubt if this could happen in Ukraine because the crisis is no longer solely or even mainly about that country but has transmuted into a general confrontation between Russia and the West.\n\nFurther thoughts\n\nWhen I read about Boris Johnson’s attack on Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for criticising the government’s plan to deport to Rwanda asylum seekers crossing the Channel, I looked through the window of my house in Canterbury at the medieval church of St Dunstan’s 40 yards away on the other side of the road.\n\nThe reason why Johnson’s self-serving attempt to divert attention from the latest scandal to engulf him made me glance at the church is that it is closely associated with two of the greatest religious martyrs in English history, who were both killed for opposing the secular power. In a crypt in St Dunstan’s is the head of Sir Thomas More, executed in 1535 for refusing to accept Henry VIII as Supreme Head of the Church of England and other acts of opposition to the Reformation.\n\nPresumably a 16th century Johnson would have been cheering on the executioner who beheaded More on Tower Hill for putting a proper end to a man who believed that religious faith could not be separated from political allegiance.\n\nThe reason why More’s severed head is in there is that his daughter Margaret Roper rescued it from a stake on London Bridge and put it in the crypt of the Roper Chapel which was close to the house where she lived.\n\nBut St Dunstan’s has an early link to English prelates who criticised and opposed the political powers-that-be. It was from here that Henry II, barefoot and wearing a hair shirt, began his walk to Canterbury Cathedral on 12 July 1174 in penitence for his role in the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, three and a half years earlier. It was never entirely clear how sorry Henry really was for having precipitated, probably accidentally, the killing of his former friend turned enemy by four of his knights, but he certainly knew how to say sorry.\n\nHe confessed that “his incautious words” had led to the killing, asked to be punished, was whipped by the monks and spent the night praying in the cathedral. This was so successful as a bit of royal theatre that he kept returning to Canterbury in later years to repeat his ritual penitence.\n\nA message here, perhaps, for Johnson the next time he has to make his incoherent apologies for some piece of mendacity or chicanery.\n\nBeneath the Radar\n\nA UK court has formally approved the extradition of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, to the US to face espionage charges. What Assange did was no different from what any investigative journalist does. But once again there has scarcely been a cheep out of the British media, both liberal and conservative.\n\nCockburn’s Picks\n\nCompare the treatment of Assange with that of Katherine Gunn, the GCHQ translator who leaked a classified memo to a newspaper in 2003 exposing a US plot to spy on the UN shortly before the invasion of Iraq in 2003 in the excellent film Official Secrets with Keira Knightley playing Gunn.', 'image': 'https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Reporters_Notebook_-_Confusion_Chaos_as_Russia_Invades_Ukraine_02.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:26:43'}

This may be partly attributable to the not insignificant administrative issues associated with the merger between the Insurance Authority and the UAE Central Bank, as well as the disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNevertheless, it is interesting to monitor the continuing development of the insurance dispute resolution committees. As the number of cases produced by the committees increases, we are getting more and more insight into how these cases are handled and how they interact with the local courts. The year 2022 will likely be one to watch as the many disputes arising out of covid-19 gradually begin to wind down.\n\nAlbeit not specifically insurance related, there have been some significant developments in terms of alternative dispute resolution, which will likely have repercussions for insurance practitioners. For instance, the viability of mediation has certainly been strengthened pursuant to the new Mediation Law.\n\nIn terms of arbitration, 2021 also saw the enactment of Decree No. (34) of 2021 Concerning the Dubai International Arbitration Centre. This Decree abolished two established arbitration centres, namely the Emirates Maritime Arbitration Centre and the Dubai International Financial Centre Arbitration Institute, which is believed to include the DIFC LCIA arbitration centre. Pursuant to the Decree, all rights and obligations of these abolished centres are transferred to the Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC).\n\nInsurers who use DIFC LCIA or EMAC arbitration clauses in their policies may wish to review this drafting policy going forward and consider incorporating DIAC arbitration.\n\nOutlook and conclusions\n\nFirst of all, we anticipate a busy year in terms of insurance regulation.\n\nIn particular, 2022 may well see the introduction of further guidance on consolidation between the Insurance Authority and the Central Bank. The merger of the Insurance Authority into the Central Bank's regulatory ambit will likely see further procedural change, but also increased regulatory efficiency. We await with interest further details on how the merged regulator will function and how the domestic regulatory framework will be impacted and improved.\n\nLike all industries, the insurance market in the UAE is heavily influenced by technological development. For instance, we are seeing established practitioners change their business practices by incorporating more remote and electronic procedures, both in terms of underwriting and claims management.\n\nWe are also seeing a number of disruptors enter the market. For instance, four price comparison websites have secured licences from the Regulator since December 2020. This demonstrates how traditional methods of carrying out insurance business in the UAE may be changing.\n\nThe technological revolution will also affect the types of risk being insured. For instance, we predict a big increase in the nature and number of cyber risks being underwritten in 2022. Political risk cover is also likely to be an area to watch.\n\nAs the world emerges out of the covid-19 pandemic, we expect a dynamic year in the insurance industry, with the UAE being no exception.", 'image': 'https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:26:57'}

Full remarks: https://t.co/Vrebj4JD3h pic.twitter.com/8uw0ZgBgMS — UN Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (@UNDPPA) April 25, 2022\n\nMoreover, all political, religious and community leaders must “do their part to reduce tensions, uphold the status quo at the Holy Sites, and ensure their sanctity is respected”.\n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian leaders have made some commendable efforts to ease tensions, condemn attacks and rein in violence that “should continue,” Mr. Wennesland told the Ambassadors, citing regional and international partners’ help in restoring calm at the Holy Sites and ensuring continued access for Muslim worshippers.\n\nDeadly attacks\n\nDaily violence has escalated sharply in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) and in Israel, the senior UN official stated.\n\n“In the occupied West Bank and Israel, 23 Palestinians, including three women and four children, were killed by Israeli security forces (ISF) during demonstrations, clashes, search-and-arrest operations, attacks and alleged attacks against Israelis, and other incidents, and 541 Palestinians, including 30 women and 80 children, were injured”.\n\nMoreover, Israeli settlers or other civilians perpetrated 66 attacks against Palestinians resulting in nine injuries and/or damage to Palestinian property.\n\n“In all, 12 Israelis, including two women, as well as three foreign nationals, were killed and 82 Israelis, including some six children and four women, as well one foreign national, were injured by Palestinians in shooting, stabbing and ramming attacks, clashes, the throwing of stones and Molotov cocktails, and other incidents,” Mr. Wennesland said.\n\nIn total, Palestinians perpetrated 104 attacks against Israeli civilians resulting in injuries and/or damage to Israeli property. Over two weeks, four terrorist attacks took place inside Israel – the deadliest such attacks in years.\n\nThe Special Coordinator elaborated on a heat-breaking list of casualties on both sides since 22 March, saying, “perpetrators of all acts of violence must be held accountable and brought swiftly to justice.”\n\n‘Deeply troubling’\n\nTurning to Gaza, “the security, humanitarian and economic situation remains deeply troubling,” said the Special Coordinator, shining a light on barriers in accessing health care.\n\n“Palestinians in Gaza continue to suffer as a result of years of severe economic and movement restrictions resulting from the Israeli closure regime, as well as the nature of Hamas rule and the ongoing threat of violence”.\n\nPalestinians in Gaza continue to suffer as a result of years of severe economic and movement restrictions – UN Special Coordinator\n\nAfter several months with no rocket fire, militants in Gaza launched five rockets towards Israel, with one causing property damage in the Israeli town of Sderot. The others were either intercepted by the Iron Dome system, landed short in the Strip, or in open areas inside Israel.\n\nFollowing the launches, Israeli authorities closed the Israeli Erez crossing to Palestinian workers and traders.\n\n“The indiscriminate launching of rockets towards Israeli population centres violates international law and must stop immediately,” Mr. Wennesland underscored.\n\nUpbeat moves\n\nSome positive developments took place as the Israeli Government approved 20,050 permits for Palestinian workers from Gaza to enter Israel, in addition to some existing 2,500 permits for traders and businessmen.\n\nAnd the Government also allocated some $12 million to improving the crossings between Gaza and Israel.\n\nMoreover, following an agreement between both sides, preparations are underway to facilitate into Gaza, dual-use materials and equipment needed to repair and maintain fishing boats as part of revitalizing the fishing sector, which Mr. Wennesland upheld, “should pave the way for a similar easing of restrictions in other sectors”.\n\nUkraine fallout\n\nFollowing the Ukrainian conflict, rising prices and market disruptions across the Middle East vulnerable families in the OPT are under threat of food security.\n\nThe quarterly distribution cost of the UN agency that supports Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has increased by 42 per cent since the end of 2021 in Gaza – where the UN accounts for nearly 60 per cent of food supply.\n\nWithout additional funding, the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNRWA will not be able to meet the Palestinian’s food needs this year, which could lead to destabilization across the OPT, particularly in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHe appealed for urgent support to UNRWA, which faces a critical financial situation and urged the parties, regional partners and international organizations to move the Palestinian Authorities (PA) onto “a firmer fiscal footing”, while addressing broader systemic issues.\n\nUN Photo/Mark Garten Security Council Meets on Situation in Middle East, Including Palestinian Question\n\nSpiralling tensions\n\nViolence over the past month has underscored that managing the conflict is not a substitute towards resolving it.\n\nThe UN official encouraged lowering tensions, maintaining calm and addressing conflict drivers, and added that settlements be halted, the PA’s fiscal stability shored up and Palestinian institutions strengthened to lay the foundations for a political process towards a two-State reality.\n\nLatest offense\n\nAmidst ongoing tensions in Israel and the OPT, Mr. Wennesland raised his concern over rocket fire across the Blue Line into Israel this morning, which Israel responded to with artillery fire into Lebanon.\n\nThere were no casualties reported and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) continues to engage with the Lebanese Armed Forces to increase its counter rocket launching operations to prevent further such incidents and contribute to stability along the Blue Line.', 'image': 'https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production+Library/14-05-2021-Qalandia_checkpoint.jpg/image770x420cropped.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:19'}

Keeping the US Navy Pacific Fleet in place.\n\nRussia is to maybe ‘repatriate’ south and eastern Europe back into ‘the New’ USSR, along with any of the weaker regional European nations, while using military force and weapons ‘testing’ on necessary targets to achieve Russian ambitions. Added to that, the use of mercenaries, Iranian terror proxies, stricter policies on oil and gas distribution as intimidation, and the threat of nuclear war. And, frankly, no one knows exactly what Putin will do, but Putin.\n\nThus, keeping part or most of the USFF, along with NATO, occupied with UK and EU defense, while still having to maintain the US 6th Fleet in protection of the Middle East, basically, for Israel.\n\nWhich is Putin’s ‘secret’ wild card he has yet to play (that I’ll get to shortly) and which could plausibly trigger the famed, World War III.\n\nThe Russians know part of their war is being delayed, and with losses, partially due to ultra-strong and concentrated media coverage.\n\nBecause, let’s be analytically straightforward, besides brutal and horrific Ukrainian human losses, and maybe except for Odessa Port, the country has little strategic value to the West comparable to another region that I will illustrate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue to the Ukraine crisis world dependence on Russian oil and gas has elevated concerns to ensure the oil rich Middle East is of colossal ‘peaceful’ strategic value to the West.\n\nFurthermore, Israel’s strong US lobby abilities (both Christian and Jewish), an ally, a nuclear power triad, the only democracy in the Middle East, an Arab Team partner in defense of Iran, an Israeli Western buffer against Iran, and the historical gateway or highway of the Middle East, makes Israel invaluable and necessary. Hence, a monumental strategic factor.\n\nSo, if the news were to change or focus on a Middle East regional war, Ukraine would probably fall in days if not in hours. Or reduced to sections of foreign armies, groups and mafia-clans, ruling each of ‘their territory’ in Ukraine.\n\nAfterwards, Ukraine would unfortunately be forgotten as the once highly publicized, 11 year long and continuous, Syrian Civil War. Remember that? The world’s leaderships and news putting ‘red lines’, threats, and enormous media coverage’s on Syria, later eventually, nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, all Russia would need to do is, to clandestinely, ignite the Middle East war through any variety of means; Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Russia and Israeli combat aircraft, radar/anti-aircraft, and soldiers in too close proximity in Syria, Iran, and some elements of Iraq, Jordan and Arab Israelis against Israel.\n\nThen, the entire world dynamics would alter, particularly for USA, in order to salvage Israel, and the Arab Oil States, while trying to prevent WWIII.\n\nHowever, Russia may not even have to act; as the Middle East Region is already highly unstable and expectations and intel of more violent confrontations along with persistent threats, terror, attacks and retaliations abound.\n\nDon’t be fooled by Russia’s, and for that matter China’s, apparent inaction or lack of strong reactions despite their military buildups. They are constantly monitoring and evaluating, mainly USA, on what or how to proceed. They know the power of USA from World War Two, and USA’s present abilities. Which is why they progress cautiously.\n\nBoth Russia’s and China’s tremendously brilliant and highly talented, formidable, and productive intelligence agencies are many times exceedingly underestimated. For at times, evidently and reportedly, they combine and centrally coordinate with the terrifying Russian underworld’s, and equally chilling Chinese underworld triad’s, computer geniuses who utilize the very best, advanced computer equipment money can buy, apparently working in tandem for parallel objectives, without respect to western laws, codes of behavior, morals, or fear of criminal courts, (as anyone or any court trying to arrest foreign mafias or triads would have to have a torture or death wish, specifically, in relation with the Russians and Chinese). Both of which are stoutly devoted and patriotic to their culture and countries; there is no Woke Culture in their worlds. That would be considered traitorous or heretical.\n\nMany times, it feels as if we western analysts are a step behind, playing catch-up, or working with ‘restrictions’ or boundaries we cannot cross, while competing against those without as such (I am not saying, suggesting or supporting breaking laws, merely pointing out the reality and challenges).\n\nEffectively, Russia and China can analyze the UK and EU weaknesses and fears, as well as concentrate on the number one Superpower; USA’s weaknesses, internal divisions, and plausible tactics to keep USA’s military forces divided globally.\n\nThen move accordingly.\n\nReturning to the Middle East as the reports of a failing USA/Iran Treaty continue to mount and vibrate; I have spoken, written and published much on this subject but will repeat in the slim chance the enemies of Israel are willing to listen and ponder to save their own lives, religion, culture, territories and countries.\n\nNow I know many of you think I’m this crazy, stupid ‘infidel’ gentile in the Middle East, however, I do highly care about life, religion, culture, traditions and the survival of the Middle East.\n\nEnemies of Israel; who are currently attacking (including localized terror attacks), planning to attack, and planning to attack as a coordinated, massive assault.\n\nYou, do not know Israel and what they are capable of.\n\nIsrael may be a tiny country, hard to defend borders, greatly outnumber, and surrounded by hostiles.\n\nBut your intel is flawed, your spies and paid local informers are lying or embellishing information, because of their hatred for Israel, and the need and want for your help in attacks or revenge against Israel.\n\nRemember the country of Jordan’s huge mistake in the 1967 Six-Day War? Despite being warned by Israel not to get involved, Jordan instead hearkened to Egypt. Immediately and forthwith the Jordan Air Force was crushed by the Israeli Air Force, and soon Jordan lost the Holy Sites in Jerusalem, and Judea and Samaria (known as the West Bank).\n\nFurthermore, if the combined Arab League of skilled, trained armies from seven countries, with all their collective fighter aircraft, bombers, tanks, artillery and fully armed soldiers could not defeat Israel in 1948; Israel with only light weapons and mortars, jeeps, and light-armored vehicles, four fighters and three bombers, and soldiers with little or no professional training, how can you possibly conceive of beating Israel now as an experienced nation of war, of both male and female, fully equipped in every venue, and a Superpower?\n\nDon’t believe me? Look up military facts and the history yourselves.\n\nMoreover, Jewish Israeli infighting is not a weakness, and your recent terror attacks have immediately dissolved that as nearly all civilian gun-licensed Israelis are rearming, as they were prior 1995, and are ready to fight and kill terrorists and enemies, from their homes and on the streets, as you’ve witnessed on the news.\n\nIsrael has been in perpetual wars and conflicts for more than 70 years, extremely experienced in all forms of warfare, including their women, most Israelis have served in some capacity in the military, and still do in the Reserves. They have the number two jet ace of the world, and many ace aviators, passing that valuable combat flight knowledge on, plus in simulators, and computer software. Their military can fight either conventional warfare, tech wars, and they are a Nuclear Triad. A real, superpower that can instantaneously reduce any city or nation inoperable, to say the least.\n\nI also repeat, none of the threatening peoples, territories or nations against Israel have the military years, combined operations, and continuous past 70 years battle experience that Israel has. Not even Russia, as part of her forces are in Syria waiting for orders.\n\nThat is a statistic, a major, substantial factor, that needs to be heavily calculated and weighted before going to war against Israel.\n\nAnd, as an analyst that evaluates and tracks human behavior, as well as military, don’t let Israeli value of life or morals confuse you into thinking that is weakness.\n\nJewish Israelis are taught from birth about the Holocaust, world prejudice, and the concrete need to survive and protect Israel as the Jewish State.\n\nConsequently, Israel will stop at NOTHING and by NO-ONE to protect Israel, and Israel will strike by any means, and with any means necessary, if Israel or their main cities are attacked by armies, guided missiles, bio/chemical weapons, or the THREAT of nuclear weapons or dirty bombs. Leaving the aggressors, their territories and aggressor countries in total ruins, dead, and humiliated to history as fools attacking Israel – a highly superior military, with decades of combat experience, and with active nuclear weapons.\n\nTo my analyst and related friends and peers; I fully expect comments and opinions, but please remember to be kind.\n\nAll of us, one time or another has had a ranking officer or official ‘yell’ at us, and/or been insulted and humiliated online.\n\nPlus, remember that articles and reports as this, are a brief compilation, of volumes of info gathered that never makes it into final print or publish, and the work is also scrutinized, maybe altered, and then approved by editors who are responsible for what ends up on their media venue.', 'image': 'https://static.timesofisrael.com/blogs/uploads/users/Don-Davis-1530953485-400x400.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:28:13'}

The situation in Jerusalem, however, remains relatively calm despite inflammatory rhetoric and violent clashes between Palestinians and the Israeli security forces at the holy sites.\n\nAll sides must do their part to reduce tensions, uphold the status quo at the holy sites, and ensure their sanctity is respected by all, he said, welcoming statements by senior Israeli officials reiterating Israel\'s commitment to upholding the status quo and ensuring that only Muslims would be allowed to pray on the Holy Esplanade.\n\n"At this sensitive and volatile moment, Israeli and Palestinian leaders have made some commendable efforts to ease tensions, condemn attacks and rein in violence," he said. Regional and international partners, such as the United Nations, Egypt and Jordan, have engaged to help restore calm and ensure continued access for Muslim worshippers, he said, stressing that "these efforts should continue".\n\nThe violence and spiralling tensions of the past month have underscored that efforts to manage the conflict are not a substitute for real progress towards resolving it, he said, stressing that a serious escalation is avoidable and sustained calm can open the space for more serious discussions about further improvements.\n\nHe then urged the parties to maintain calm so the final week of Ramadan can take place and be celebrated without interruption. "Having said that, we must not lose sight of the imperative to end the occupation and advance towards a two-State reality," he said, expressing the United Nations\' determination to support Israelis and Palestinians in moving towards that future.\n\nIn the ensuing discussion, Israel and Palestine traded accusations about the incidents at the site, which is referred to by Muslims as "Haram al-Sharif" and as "Temple Mount" by Jews.\n\nThe Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine said that a few days ago, Israeli occupying forces stormed the Aqsa Mosque compound/Haram al-Sharif, shooting at worshippers and desecrating the mosque with military boots and violence. He pointed out that 200 Palestinians, including women and children were wounded and 400 arrested, yet Israel claims it is upholding the historic status quo.\n\nNot only does Israel use security to justify killing Palestinian children on their way to school, it labels Palestinian worshippers as terrorists, he continued. Jewish extremists and settlers are not merely visiting Haram al‑Sharif, but are seeking a takeover. Israel has no authority over Haram al‑Sharif where the historic and legal status quo must be upheld, he said, adding that the occupying Power is also targeting the Palestinian identity of the city.\n\nIsrael\'s representative, noting the convergence of Passover, Easter and Ramadan in 2022, said that what could have been an opportunity for peaceful coexistence was instead used by Palestinian extremists to incite violence. Hundreds of Palestinian terrorists on the Temple Mount posed a threat to both Muslim and Jewish worshippers, and Israeli police had to intervene.\n\nIt is ludicrous to place mobs of violent rioters on the same moral scale as a law-abiding democracy making every effort to keep the peace, and such a comparison plays directly into the web of lies spun by terror groups, he said. Israel always ensures the freedom of worship for all religions and is committed to protecting holy sites and the status quo. The only ones breaking the status quo on the Temple Mount are Palestinian terror groups.\n\nCouncil members and non-members alike called for the status quo of the holy sites to be maintained, expressing alarm about the violent clashes and urging both sides to exercise restraint and pursue peace through dialogue. France\'s delegate said respect for the status quo of holy sites is essential and any allegations of the disproportionate use of force must be investigated. He added, however, that the root causes of conflict, such as the resumption of settlement activities and evictions, must end.\n\nMexico\'s representative urged Israel to refrain from altering the demographic composition, institutional structure and the physical, cultural and historical characters of Jerusalem.\n\nThe speaker for the United Arab Emirates acknowledged recent steps taken by the Israeli Government to reduce tensions and urged similar steps be taken to create a stable, sustainable political environment and revive the Middle East peace process.\n\nThe representative of the United States condemned the rocket launches from Gaza and Lebanon by militant groups that are seeking to exploit the situation in Jerusalem to advance their narrow interests, adding that his country is engaged diplomatically with all sides and remains firmly committed to a two-State solution.\n\nJordan\'s delegate called for international coordination to prevent alterations to the historic character of Jerusalem, adding that the Jordanian Administration is the only entity authorized to manage the affairs of the Aqsa Mosque compound in its entirety. His country has engaged with Palestinians and various international actors, such as Israel and the United States, within the framework of Jordan\'s continued role in protecting holy sites, he said, demanding that Israel allow free access to the Aqsa Mosque compound and lift the restrictive barriers.\n\nThe speaker for Lebanon commended the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for its role in de-escalating and reducing tensions and in preventing any miscalculation or escalation along the Blue Line, which remains indispensable in the context of the daily Israeli violations of Lebanon\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He asked the Security Council to consider extending UNIFIL\'s provision of additional non-lethal material and logistical support to the Lebanese Armed Forces for one more year.\n\nSyria\'s delegate reiterated the call to grant Palestine full membership in the United Nations, also noting the threat posed by Israel\'s actions to the security of his country and the region. Calling on the Security Council to enforce the 1974 Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria, he pointed to a series of repeated Israeli attacks on Syrian territory, the last of which occurred on 14 April, around Damascus. Israeli measures aimed at changing the legal and demographic nature of the Golan, seizing land and property, looting natural resources and wealth, and implementing settlement plans are aimed at perpetuating the occupation and obliterating the Syrian identity of the occupied Syrian Golan, he added.\n\nThe Permanent Observer of the League of Arab States, echoing other speakers, said that, while the Council devotes attention to recent developments in Europe, it must neglect the protracted conflict in the Middle East. He urged the Council to preserve the legal status quo of East Jerusalem, calling for the Council to organize a field visit to the city, intensify efforts to help revive direct dialogue between the two parties and support Palestinian refugees and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).\n\nEgypt\'s representative, noting that continued attempts to "Judaize" East Jerusalem portend a dangerous escalation, called for an end to all unilateral measures in the West Bank. For its part, his country has invested $500 million in the Gaza Strip and continues to work with international and regional partners to ensure the resumption of negotiations towards a two-State solution.\n\nAlso speaking today were the representatives of Norway, Ghana, Kenya, Russian Federation, Ireland, Brazil, India, Gabon, China, Albania, United Kingdom, Algeria, Turkey, Morocco, Iran, Tunisia, Malaysia, Peru, South Africa, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Maldives, Bahrain, Pakistan, Qatar, Venezuela, Kuwait, Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Oman and Cuba, as well as the Deputy Head of the European Union delegation.

Among them: promoting “healthy conversation” on the platform.\n\nAfter years of criticism for Twitter’s apparent failures to prevent its platform from turning toxic, Dorsey acknowledged the scourge of “abuse, harassment, troll armies,” as well as bots, misinformation campaigns and “increasingly divisive echo chambers” on the social network, and he called on researchers to help improve the situation.\n\n“We think it is a growth vector over the long term, and it’s the right thing to do for the people on Twitter, and also for the world,” Dorsey said on the company’s earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2018 of the focus on the “health” of the platform.\n\nIn the years since, Twitter (TWTR) has made significant progress toward that goal, including banning many accounts promoting abuse and spam, adding labels for false or misleading information, banning the misgendering of transgender people and launching a team dedicated to studying and increasing transparency around the technology that determines what content is promoted on the site. Just last week, Twitter said it would embrace third-party tools for users to help prevent harassment.\n\nBut some who’ve been following the work Twitter has done in recent years worry it could be unraveled now that billionaire Elon Musk has succeeded in his bid to acquire Twitter in a deal worth about $44 billion.\n\nMusk, a controversial Twitter user with a history of erratic behavior on and off the platform, has called for freer speech on the social network and policies that would favor leaving up most tweets and accounts.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech exist,” Musk said in an on-stage interview at the TED conference earlier this month. “If it’s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.”\n\nUnder his ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken in recent years to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nBeyond potentially alienating employees who have worked on or support efforts to improve content moderation on the platform, undoing Twitter’s progress on “healthy conversations” also risks losing users at a time when the company has been fighting to reverse sluggish growth. It could also turn off advertisers wary of having their ads run next to harmful content. While Musk has said his bid for Twitter is “not a way to make money,” it is still a business and advertising remains its central revenue driver.\n\nThough smaller than some rival platforms, Twitter also has an outsized influence in the online (and offline) world because it is popular among influential figures in media, politics and entertainment, and because it has often acted as a model for other platforms on how to address thorny harmful content issues. Thus, changes to Twitter’s policies could have broader ripple effects on politics and society.\n\nTwitter has certainly not been perfect on content moderation issues, but as Kirsten Martin, professor of technology ethics at Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, put it: “Twitter has consistently strived to be a responsible social media company through not only their content moderation but also their hires in the area of machine learning ethics.”\n\n“I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter’s values,” Martin added.\n\nTwitter and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA billionaire with a history of trolling\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era, but he is also someone who has courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has 83 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand is a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and he has compared Twitter’s new CEO Parag Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nMusk and others have pointed out that most of Twitter’s board has little experience actually using the platform. The same cannot be said of Musk, an avid Twitter user with a rabid following who well understands the dynamics of the platform. Still, Musk’s experience of using Twitter as an ultra-rich, White man, is inherently different than that of most users, and especially those who are women or from other marginalized communities Twitter has tried to protect and who now may be at risk if its moderation policies are rolled back.\n\n“Any time somebody says free speech, it always means free speech for the powerful. It does not mean free speech for the less powerful,” said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter engineering manager who started its product safety and security team and left the company in 2015. “[Musk] says he wants to make it a free speech platform. What he wants is a platform to say what he wants — and wants other people like him to say what they want — without any accountability.”\n\nFor his part, Musk said on Twitter Monday: “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nProminent users like game developer Brianna Wu have for years spoken out about how online Twitter mobs can spiral from online hate speech to real-world harm. She now worries the progress she and other users have pushed for on Twitter will be reversed.\n\n“There have been so many hard fought battles over these [safety] policies behind the scenes,” Wu, who now serves as executive director of a PAC for progressives, told CNN Business. “I am extremely concerned Musk is going to roll back all the hard work that’s been done to combat hate speech on the platform.”\n\nMusk’s plan for Twitter\n\nAt the TED conference earlier this month, Musk presented his broad strokes vision for Twitter, including making its algorithm public to increase transparency around its decisions about content enforcement and promotion — a move that experts say it is far from a silver bullet. Moreover, Musk said Twitter would be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.”\n\n“My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” Musk said.\n\nMany followers of the company have speculated that if his takeover bid succeeds, Musk could restore the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned early last year following the insurrection at the US Capitol. Such a move could have huge implications for the upcoming 2024 presidential election as Twitter was a key tool for Trump to rally his base, promote political allies and deride critics and spread false and misleading claims.\n\n“If Musk buys Twitter, then he will surely return Trump to the platform, opening the door for a viable 2024 run,” Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said on Twitter Monday before the deal was announced.\n\nTrump, for his part, told Fox News Monday that he is not planning to rejoin Twitter, if invited, and will instead start using his own app Truth Social (Trump has only posted on the site once, back in February). “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH,” Trump told Fox.\n\nDonovan also noted that under Musk’s leadership, Twitter could “further become a terrain of culture wars. With a mandate for ‘free speech,’ the kind of harassment that content moderation tampers will go into overdrive targeting lgbtq groups, women, BIPOC, and anyone else fighting for civil rights.”\n\nMusk said in a statement Monday that he also wants “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nA platform with more work to do\n\nEach of the major social media platforms have faced pressure from lawmakers, researchers and the public to do more to crack down on abuse, harassment and misinformation, and have taken different approaches with varying degrees of success. Twitter has in many cases been seen as a leader in the industry in terms of how it handles problematic content, and in being transparent about its approach and the success of its efforts. Most notably, Twitter was the first of the major platforms to ban Trump for violating its policy on inciting violence, pushing other platforms to follow suit.\n\n“It’s not great today, but it’s better,” Wu said. “I think people don’t understand how much we have to lose.”\n\nTwitter’s board is said to be nearing an agreement to sell the social media company to Elon Musk.\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said he’s hopeful that Twitter remains a place where people can speak freely while also feeling safe. “When I say safe and secure, I mean from bigotry, and the kind of terrible trolling that makes it too toxic for so many of us,” he added.\n\nOthers, however, are less optimistic. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said that Musk has a “fairly unsophisticated view” of the factors a platform must consider when it “provides access for bad actors to normal people.”\n\nHarmful content can have real-world consequences — the Myanmar Genocide and the Capitol Riot are two of the most egregious examples, but a deluge of harassment and veiled threats of offline harm can severely impact users on an individual basis, as well — and social media platforms face a difficult balancing act in considering how to allow users to speak as freely as possible while also protecting them from such harms.\n\nWhile Musk has said he wants to allow “all legal speech on Twitter,” the lines for what is legal can be blurry and vary from country to country — and may also be soon to change, as regulators home in on the harms social media platforms can have on users, especially young people, and civic processes.\n\n“[Twitter has] started to talk about the morality of what they do, in a way that implies that they get it,” Ahmed said. But with Musk, “it feels like … we have to go and re-educate another kind of billionaire, libertarian, man-child that [Twitter] is the real world … I would hope he can see the difference between you know, being a douche and being dangerous.”\n\nSome experts also question whether a less-moderated platform would be a sustainable business. Several new platforms launched in recent years have promised to take a less restrictive approach to content moderation, often in hopes of attracting right-leaning users frustrated with the Big Tech giants, but have largely failed to gain significant adoption. The most recent example: Trump’s Truth Social. Online advertisers are also hesitant to have their ads run alongside dangerous or controversial content.\n\n“The general public doesn’t want to see more conspiracy theories and more harassment and more hate speech,” said Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow and director of the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative at the German Marshall Fund. “There’s this [disconnect] between what he’s saying he wants to do [to loosen content restrictions], which sounds like a culture war initiative, versus saying that he wants to increase their profits. It doesn’t seem to add up.”', 'image': 'https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2022/04/220425115235-restricted-elon-musk-twitter-profile-exlarge-169.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:25'}

Among them: promoting “healthy conversation” on the platform.\n\nAfter years of criticism for Twitter’s apparent failures to prevent its platform from turning toxic, Dorsey acknowledged the scourge of “abuse, harassment, troll armies,” as well as bots, misinformation campaigns and “increasingly divisive echo chambers” on the social network, and he called on researchers to help improve the situation.\n\n“We think it is a growth vector over the long term, and it’s the right thing to do for the people on Twitter, and also for the world,” Dorsey said on the company’s earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2018 of the focus on the “health” of the platform.\n\nIn the years since, Twitter (TWTR) has made significant progress toward that goal, including banning many accounts promoting abuse and spam, adding labels for false or misleading information, banning the misgendering of transgender people and launching a team dedicated to studying and increasing transparency around the technology that determines what content is promoted on the site. Just last week, Twitter said it would embrace third-party tools for users to help prevent harassment.\n\nBut some who’ve been following the work Twitter has done in recent years worry it could be unraveled now that billionaire Elon Musk has succeeded in his bid to acquire Twitter in a deal worth about $44 billion.\n\nMusk, a controversial Twitter user with a history of erratic behavior on and off the platform, has called for freer speech on the social network and policies that would favor leaving up most tweets and accounts.\n\n“If in doubt, let the speech exist,” Musk said in an on-stage interview at the TED conference earlier this month. “If it’s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.”\n\nUnder his ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken in recent years to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nBeyond potentially alienating employees who have worked on or support efforts to improve content moderation on the platform, undoing Twitter’s progress on “healthy conversations” also risks losing users at a time when the company has been fighting to reverse sluggish growth. It could also turn off advertisers wary of having their ads run next to harmful content. While Musk has said his bid for Twitter is “not a way to make money,” it is still a business and advertising remains its central revenue driver.\n\nThough smaller than some rival platforms, Twitter also has an outsized influence in the online (and offline) world because it is popular among influential figures in media, politics and entertainment, and because it has often acted as a model for other platforms on how to address thorny harmful content issues. Thus, changes to Twitter’s policies could have broader ripple effects on politics and society.\n\nTwitter has certainly not been perfect on content moderation issues, but as Kirsten Martin, professor of technology ethics at Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, put it: “Twitter has consistently strived to be a responsible social media company through not only their content moderation but also their hires in the area of machine learning ethics.”\n\n“I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter’s values,” Martin added.\n\nTwitter and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA billionaire with a history of trolling\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era, but he is also someone who has courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has 83 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand is a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and he has compared Twitter’s new CEO Parag Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nMusk and others have pointed out that most of Twitter’s board has little experience actually using the platform. The same cannot be said of Musk, an avid Twitter user with a rabid following who well understands the dynamics of the platform. Still, Musk’s experience of using Twitter as an ultra-rich, White man, is inherently different than that of most users, and especially those who are women or from other marginalized communities Twitter has tried to protect and who now may be at risk if its moderation policies are rolled back.\n\n“Any time somebody says free speech, it always means free speech for the powerful. It does not mean free speech for the less powerful,” said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter engineering manager who started its product safety and security team and left the company in 2015. “[Musk] says he wants to make it a free speech platform. What he wants is a platform to say what he wants — and wants other people like him to say what they want — without any accountability.”\n\nFor his part, Musk said on Twitter Monday: “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nProminent users like game developer Brianna Wu have for years spoken out about how online Twitter mobs can spiral from online hate speech to real-world harm. She now worries the progress she and other users have pushed for on Twitter will be reversed.\n\n“There have been so many hard fought battles over these [safety] policies behind the scenes,” Wu, who now serves as executive director of a PAC for progressives, told CNN Business. “I am extremely concerned Musk is going to roll back all the hard work that’s been done to combat hate speech on the platform.”\n\nMusk’s plan for Twitter\n\nAt the TED conference earlier this month, Musk presented his broad strokes vision for Twitter, including making its algorithm public to increase transparency around its decisions about content enforcement and promotion — a move that experts say it is far from a silver bullet. Moreover, Musk said Twitter would be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.”\n\n“My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” Musk said.\n\nMany followers of the company have speculated that if his takeover bid succeeds, Musk could restore the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned early last year following the insurrection at the US Capitol. Such a move could have huge implications for the upcoming 2024 presidential election as Twitter was a key tool for Trump to rally his base, promote political allies and deride critics and spread false and misleading claims.\n\n“If Musk buys Twitter, then he will surely return Trump to the platform, opening the door for a viable 2024 run,” Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said on Twitter Monday before the deal was announced.\n\nTrump, for his part, told Fox News Monday that he is not planning to rejoin Twitter, if invited, and will instead start using his own app Truth Social (Trump has only posted on the site once, back in February). “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH,” Trump told Fox.\n\nDonovan also noted that under Musk’s leadership, Twitter could “further become a terrain of culture wars. With a mandate for ‘free speech,’ the kind of harassment that content moderation tampers will go into overdrive targeting lgbtq groups, women, BIPOC, and anyone else fighting for civil rights.”\n\nMusk said in a statement Monday that he also wants “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”\n\nA platform with more work to do\n\nEach of the major social media platforms have faced pressure from lawmakers, researchers and the public to do more to crack down on abuse, harassment and misinformation, and have taken different approaches with varying degrees of success. Twitter has in many cases been seen as a leader in the industry in terms of how it handles problematic content, and in being transparent about its approach and the success of its efforts. Most notably, Twitter was the first of the major platforms to ban Trump for violating its policy on inciting violence, pushing other platforms to follow suit.\n\n“It’s not great today, but it’s better,” Wu said. “I think people don’t understand how much we have to lose.”\n\nTwitter’s board is said to be nearing an agreement to sell the social media company to Elon Musk.\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said he’s hopeful that Twitter remains a place where people can speak freely while also feeling safe. “When I say safe and secure, I mean from bigotry, and the kind of terrible trolling that makes it too toxic for so many of us,” he added.\n\nOthers, however, are less optimistic. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said that Musk has a “fairly unsophisticated view” of the factors a platform must consider when it “provides access for bad actors to normal people.”\n\nHarmful content can have real-world consequences — the Myanmar Genocide and the Capitol Riot are two of the most egregious examples, but a deluge of harassment and veiled threats of offline harm can severely impact users on an individual basis, as well — and social media platforms face a difficult balancing act in considering how to allow users to speak as freely as possible while also protecting them from such harms.\n\nWhile Musk has said he wants to allow “all legal speech on Twitter,” the lines for what is legal can be blurry and vary from country to country — and may also be soon to change, as regulators home in on the harms social media platforms can have on users, especially young people, and civic processes.\n\n“[Twitter has] started to talk about the morality of what they do, in a way that implies that they get it,” Ahmed said. But with Musk, “it feels like … we have to go and re-educate another kind of billionaire, libertarian, man-child that [Twitter] is the real world … I would hope he can see the difference between you know, being a douche and being dangerous.”\n\nSome experts also question whether a less-moderated platform would be a sustainable business. Several new platforms launched in recent years have promised to take a less restrictive approach to content moderation, often in hopes of attracting right-leaning users frustrated with the Big Tech giants, but have largely failed to gain significant adoption. The most recent example: Trump’s Truth Social. Online advertisers are also hesitant to have their ads run alongside dangerous or controversial content.\n\n“The general public doesn’t want to see more conspiracy theories and more harassment and more hate speech,” said Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow and director of the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative at the German Marshall Fund. “There’s this [disconnect] between what he’s saying he wants to do [to loosen content restrictions], which sounds like a culture war initiative, versus saying that he wants to increase their profits. It doesn’t seem to add up.”', 'image': 'https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2022/04/220425115235-restricted-elon-musk-twitter-profile-exlarge-169.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:25'}

This would represent a significant legal threat to any elected politicians who lose their seats, they would lose legal protections such as the right to be tried only in the supreme court.\n\nThe list of possible allegations against the Bolsonaro administration include collusion with armed militias in Rio de Janeiro, spreading fake news, corruption and embezzlement of public funds and, in the president’s case, his catastrophic handling of the public health crisis of COVID-19, which has already been part of a public inquiry.\n\nThroughout his political career, Bolsonaro, like Trump, has repeatedly revealed his contempt for democratic institutions and playing by the rules. He praised the military coup of 1964 (calling it “the second Independence Day”), and the practices of that military regime, which tortured and murdered political opponents.\n\nAs a federal legislator for Rio de Janeiro, he claimed that the dictatorship should have killed “at least 30,000” citizens, among them the then president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. One of Bolsanaro’s pledges, while campaigning in 2018, was to reward police officers for killing criminal suspects.\n\nOnce elected president, he praised Rio de Janeiro’s police for shooting dead 28 people during a raid on a favela. As head of state he has also consistently resisted any limitations imposed on him, whether by the provisions of the constitution, the actions of the opposition, the checks and balances built into the federal separation of powers, or critical press coverage.\n\nLike Trump, Bolsonaro started this process of undermining confidence in the democratic process some time ago by claiming that elections were fraudulent.\n\nHe has repeatedly questioned both the electronic voting and vote-counting process, and the impartiality of the electoral courts which organize and regulate elections in Brazil.\n\nHis attacks on the reliability of the electoral system have been reinforced by the mass distribution of digital misinformation through social media.\n\nHis fake news strategy, targeting his electoral rivals, was unleashed first by his campaign team and supporters.\n\nIn October 2018, elections for state and federal deputies were held concurrently with the presidential ballot, and some legislative candidates on the same party ticket as Bolsonaro spread rumors about the soundness of the electoral process. Fernando Francischini, a Bolsonaro supporter, who was elected state deputy in Paraná, in the south of Brazil, alleged, without any evidence, that some electronic ballot boxes had prevented people from voting for Bolsonaro and had been seized.\n\nJudges at the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) ruled in October 2021 that this had not occurred, and Francischini was stripped of his seat for disseminating digital disinformation in 2018.\n\nSince then the lie has been repeated over and over by Bolsonaro, who even tried to jettison Brazil’s well-regarded electronic voting system, introduced in the late 1990s, with a paper-based one, which had proven more susceptible to fraud and abuse in the past.\n\nWhile there have been no cases of proven electronic manipulation of electoral results in Brazil, all electronic systems have potential vulnerabilities and a lack of information contributes to high levels of public distrust that can be exploited.\n\nIn any case, the constitutional amendment failed to get the necessary votes in congress to pass and the TSE, noted that, while the court would not act on the misconduct in 2018, it would punish any repetition in 2022: “the registration of candidacies will be canceled and those who engage in this activity will go to jail”.\n\nAccording to the Bolsonaro’s faithful supporters, a plot has been hatched between the polling institutes, opposition parties, corrupt elites in the judiciary, the press, and even social media companies, to prevent his re-election and put his nemesis, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, back in power. The 2021 decision by the supreme court to overturn Lula’s convictions for corruption, which had kept him out of the political picture in 2018, is seen as part of this ruse.\n\nBolsonaro’s attacks on the political system are escalating ahead of the elections. Some of his staunchest supporters are military police officers and security personnel and firearms registrations have surged under Bolsonaro’s deregulation of gun ownership, raising fears of a situation like the invasion on the US Capitol. Brazil’s democratic institutions will have to work hard to maintain the legitimacy of the system and ensure a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nFiona Macaulay is professor of Gender, Peace and Development at University of Bradford\n\nCláudio Gonçalves Couto is Associate professor at Brazilian School of Public and Business Administration (EBAPE/FGV)\n\nThis article was originally published in The Conversation.

As of April 25, the death toll was six; 45 people were rescued, and the search continued, said the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nCol. Haitham Dinnaoui, commander of the Lebanese army’s naval forces, told media April 24 that the boat had “a maximum permissible load of only 10 persons.” There were no life jackets or life rafts on the boat, he said.\n\nThe passengers were mostly Syrian refugees and Lebanese.\n\nAt a Mass April 24 on the feast of Divine Mercy, Lebanese Cardinal Bechara Rai, patriarch of Maronite Catholics, conveyed his sorrow over the boat tragedy, noting that the passengers “were trying to escape illegally from the bitter reality of their lives.”\n\nCardinal Rai expressed his hope for the rescue of those who were still missing and offered “deepest condolences to the families of the victims who died in this terrible accident, asking the Lord Almighty to rest their souls in peace and grant their families solace and comfort to endure their loss.”\n\nLocal media reported survivors accused the army of deliberately ramming a naval vessel into the boat. Dinnaoui said the captain of the migrant boat tried to outmaneuver the naval vessel, leading to the crash.\n\nA Lebanese citizen was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the smuggling operation.\n\nLebanon’s deteriorating living conditions in the once middle-income country have propelled the population into taking desperate measures to seek a better future.\n\nSince late 2019, Lebanon’s currency has devalued by more than 90%. Poverty has now become a reality for more than 80% of the population amid an economic meltdown marked by severe electricity, medicine, fuel and food shortages.\n\n“People usually run away from two kinds of death, either death from war, or death from hunger. What happened in Tripoli was people trying to escape famine and searching for a place where they feel safe, a place where they can find a future for themselves and for their children,” Father Abboud told Catholic News Service April 25.\n\n“What we have seen is a confirmation that the situation is getting worse,” he said.\n\n“Caritas has been doing its best to stand next to the needy from all nationalities and provide the basic needs from hospitalization, food, financial and health support, and much more,” he said. “But it is surely obvious that the need has become huge, and we cannot continue alone. We need the support of the international communities and all the generous donors and supporters.”\n\nWhile such illegal departures from Lebanon typically were Syrian refugees, of whom there are some 1.5 million in the Land of the Cedars, increasingly Lebanese also are risking such desperate measures to flee their crisis-stricken homeland.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency said Lebanon has been witnessing an increase in sea departures since 2020, when 38 boats with more than 1,500 passengers attempted dangerous journeys. Over 75% of the vessels were intercepted or returned to Lebanon.\n\nThe main destination is Cyprus, a member of the European Union 100 miles across the Mediterranean Sea. The migrants flee with the hopes of eventual passage to Europe.\n\nLebanon’s economic crisis — labeled as one of the world’s worst since the 1850s — has been blamed on decades of political mismanagement and corruption.\n\nThe tragedy sparked protests in Tripoli and around Lebanon, including in front of the Tripoli home of Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, a billionaire.

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n— Article continues below Petition — PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite\'s Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 0 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021.

The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square. Thank you for SIGNING and SHARING this petition to Elon Musk, urging him to now reinstate LifeSiteNews\' suspended Twitter accounts.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular amongst Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end, but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even amongst his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nPresently we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remember that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment after years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared to Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://www.lifesitenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1354093065.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:26:41'}

Or, at least that’s the story told from a steady stream of commentary bemoaning supposed U.S. neglect of its Middle East partners.\n\nFiras Maksad of the Middle East Institute, for example, dubbed the rift a “crisis” in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in March calling on Biden to renew the U.S.’s “commitment to regional defense by publicly affirming a strategic alliance” with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, or both countries will continue to cozy up to Beijing and Moscow.\n\nOn CNN Maksad argued the United States was shirking its role as “underwriter of regional security,” which, “sends alarm bells ringing both in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi and has them thinking about how to diversify away from the United States even further.”\n\nMaksad’s MEI colleagues, Bilal Saab and Karen Young, kept up the drumbeat in early April with a Foreign Policy article arguing for a new U.S. “strategic defense framework with the Gulf Arab states.” The article followed an MEI policy memo accusing the United States of being supportive of Iran’s expansionism which, amongst other issues, purportedly pushed Saudi Arabia and the UAE closer to China and Russia.\n\nNoticeably absent from these documents and media appearances clamoring for more U.S. military entanglements with Saudi Arabia and the UAE is any acknowledgement that MEI’s biggest funders are the UAE and Saudi Arabia. In fact, in 2017, leaked emails revealed a $20 million “secret” grant from the UAE to MEI.\n\nMaksad also has personal ties to Saudi and Emirati money as Responsible Statecraft has previouslypointed out. Maksad is the Managing Director of Global Policy Associates which, prior to RS’s reporting, listed Teneo as one of the firms’ clients. Teneo, incidentally, is registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to represent multiple Saudi and Emirati interests.\n\nThe Middle East Institute did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMEI isn’t alone — Saudi Arabia and the UAE have funded a number of think tanks in Washington, D.C. In fact, the UAE is one of the top foreign funders of think tanks in the United States. While none of these think tanks acts like a “lobbying firm” — as Saab himself explained to the UAE’s Ambassador to the U.S., Yousef Otaiba, in a leaked email — these think tanks often spread pro-Saudi and UAE messaging and silence critiques of these Gulf dictatorships. All while masquerading as objective without disclosing their conflicts of interest.\n\nAs Eli Clifton and I argue in a Quincy Institute report highlighting the perils of think tanks’ donor secrecy, it’s not enough for think tanks to just provide a list of donors on their website — as MEI does — they must also “publicize conflict-of-interest policies and proactively identify the appearance of conflicts of interest between institutional funders, or staff conducting outside political work, and a think tank’s institutional research products.” Claims of “intellectual independence” ring hollow when used to defend work products that serve the interests of top funders.\n\nMedia outlets also have an obligation to acknowledge these potential conflicts of interest. By failing to disclose these funding ties, Foreign Policy, The Wall Street Journal, and CNN are omitting critical information that could put these experts’ comments into better perspective. If, for example, consumers of these analyses knew that MEI’s top funder was the UAE, they wouldn’t be surprised when none of them mentions the multiple times top UAE officials have been accused of illegally meddling in U.S. politics and elections as a possible cause of tensions between the UAE and the United States\n\nAt a time when the public’s trust in government and media is near record lows, it’s incumbent upon think tanks and media outlets to be as transparent as possible with the consumers of their work.\n\nEditor’s note: This article has been updated for clarity.', 'image': 'https://responsiblestatecraft.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-07-05T000000Z_1781789242_RC2GEO98BC6D_RTRMADP_3_SAUDI-EMIRATES-scaled.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:42'}

On April 4, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released the final instalment of its Sixth Assessment Report, an epic synthesis of science exploring the causes and consequences of climate change. This latest document focused on the causes — chiefly, the rampant emission of greenhouse gases — and how to reduce them, fast. As one of the lead authors of the new report, I and more than 230 scientists from around the world collectively reviewed over 18,000 scientific articles and responded to around 60,000 reviewer comments over the course of more than three years. Our goal was to compile the most accurate and nuanced picture of current climate science and social science and to use this to inform international climate change treaty-making and policy design. The result was a nearly 3,000-page document that details a stark, urgent threat — but that also gives us reason for optimism. Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. First, the grim news: Average annual greenhouse gas emissions were the highest during the past decade than they have been in human history. This, despite escalating social movements, high profile declarations, and splashy vows from political and business leaders to integrate climate into investment and business decisions. Without immediate, deep, and accelerating emissions reductions in all sectors and in all regions of the world, the goal of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 C — the threshold for avoiding the worst, but not all, impacts of climate change — will be out of reach. The human and environmental toll of such a scenario is unfathomable. But glimmers of hope also emerge from this report. For the first time, we’re seeing evidence of real, sustained decreases in greenhouse gas emissions from some countries. These reductions aren’t blips that can be attributed to the economic recession of 2008 and 2009 or to the hardships inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather, they are the result of effective and, in some cases, targeted efforts to scale up renewable energy, electrify transport, enhance building efficiency, foster compact, sustainable communities, and otherwise reduce society’s carbon footprint. In some countries, these reductions are deep and comprehensive enough to be consistent with limiting global warming to 2 C, the overarching target set in the Paris Agreement of 2015.\n\nThese signs of progress also point to a path forward. The solutions to climate change now exist; we just have to adopt them. In the energy supply sector, which is responsible for around a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, a particularly major transition is required. Limiting warming to 2 C will require us to prematurely shut down oil and gas infrastructure by mid-century. In other words, we will have to leave fossil fuels in the ground, and the new infrastructure that continues to be announced in countries like Canada may end up as stranded assets by 2050. Coal, of course, will have to go. Absent effective carbon capture and storage, neither of which is currently used widely or well enough to measurably impact our climate goals, coal use will need to decline by up to 92 percent by 2030. Trans Mountain pipeline insurers dropping like flies There are promising indications, however, that a transition in the energy sector is already underway. As we watch the volatility of gas prices, we’ve also seen the price of renewable energy fall. The costs of photovoltaics used to harvest solar energy plummeted by around 85 per cent over the last 10 years, surpassing even the most optimistic projections. Likewise, the price of wind has come down around 55 per cent over the same time span, and the price of lithium-ion batteries — crucial for when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow — has come down by 85 per cent as well. Fuels like hydrogen and biofuels will fill in the gaps to support a transition in aviation and heavy shipping.", 'image': 'https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/img/2022/04/21/bruno-aguirre-_sftv3a-gsc-unsplash.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:39'}

The U.S. Left needs to support the resistance against national and colonial oppression.\n\nDuring the past two months the Israeli state has undertaken severe repression. On April 15, militarized police stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during Ramadan, arresting 450 Palestinians. Israel said its police were defending themselves from stone-throwing.\n\nThis was the latest episode in a wave of occupation violence. In the first half of March, Israeli soldiers shot and killed more than a dozen Palestinians in the West Bank, including children. In the first half of April, Israeli forces killed 17 more Palestinians. On April 10, soldiers at a concrete army post shot and killed Ghada Sabateen, a 44-year-old partially blind woman walking back to her home along the main street in the West Bank town of Husan. Three days later, soldiers at the same position shot and killed 14-year-old Qusai Fuad Hamamra. The Israeli military said Hamamra had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the army emplacement.\n\nThe Israeli government declares that it is combatting terrorists. In late March and early April, there were four deadly attacks by individual Palestinians in public places in Israel. Three of the attacks killed 11 civilians. The other killed two Israeli Border Police. Two attacks were carried out by Palestinian Israeli citizens, two by West Bank residents.\n\nThe New York Times called the arrest of 450 Palestinians and takeover of Al-Aqsa “clashes,” but said that “calm had returned” to the mosque after the mass arrest. The Times also said that violence had “escalated” after the four attacks against Israelis and suggested that killings by Israeli troops in the West Bank were “prompted” by those attacks.\n\nIn defiance of the occupation forces, 150,000 Palestinians gathered again at Al-Aqsa on the next Friday, April 22. Israeli police invaded again, injuring 31 Palestinians, including three journalists.\n\nIsrael is an officially discriminatory state. Its border regime and citizenship law violate minimal liberal norms of equal rights. Israel annexed East Jerusalem after 1967, but the vast majority of the 350,000 Palestinian residents there do not have Israeli citizenship, only residency, which can be revoked. On the other hand, the 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza, 141 square miles in area, are physically prevented from leaving that territory. Half a million Jewish Israelis live in settlements in the occupied West Bank, retaining citizenship and voting rights, but West Bank Palestinians can enter Israel only with military permission.\n\nOn March 10, the Knesset (parliament) renewed the Citizenship and Entry Law (CEL) by a 45-to-15 majority. Since 2003 the CEL has blocked Israeli citizens, namely the one-fifth of citizens who are Palestinian, from obtaining Israeli citizenship for their spouse if they marry a Palestinian person from the West Bank. Spouses from Gaza have been banned from living in Israel since 2007.\n\nPalestinian Israeli citizens or East Jerusalem residents who marry or wish to marry “foreign” Palestinian partners do not even have the right to extend permanent or guaranteed residency to them. Under an amendment to the law, such spouses may apply for government permission to live in Israel with their partners if, and only if, they are above the age of 25 for wives and 35 for husbands (treating all young adults as terrorism suspects). In 2011, the Israeli Interior Ministry granted 1 percent of such requests. About 9,000 of 13,000 such married couples currently living in Israel have only one- to two-year “stay permits” for the noncitizen spouse, which must be frequently reapplied for. Most of the others have temporary residency visas. Often, the noncitizen spouses are ineligible for national health insurance, and many do not have legal permission to work.\n\nAccess to citizenship for foreign spouses of citizens, while restricted and policed, is legally provided for in almost every state in the world. The CEL also applies to Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, or Iranian spouses. In contrast, Jews from any country are offered immediate Israeli citizenship under the settler-colonial Law of Return. Non-Jews immigrating to Israel together with their Jewish spouse also receive immediate citizenship. Most non-Jewish foreigners who marry Israelis can immediately reside in Israel and easily apply for naturalization after five years. Jewish settlers in enclaves inside the West Bank hold citizenship and can freely marry citizens within the main territory of Israel. Reuters reports that the CEL “forc[es] thousands of Palestinian families to either emigrate or live apart.” Obviously, this threatens to separate children from one of their parents. Shockingly, because the Israeli state does not offer civil marriage and recognizes only marriages performed by the Orthodox rabbinate or the Muslim, Druze, or several Christian clergy bodies, all interreligious and all gay couples wishing to legally marry must travel to another country and register their marriage when they return.\n\nWhen the CEL was enacted in 2003 during the Second Intifada (uprising), Gideon Sa’ar, who is today minister of justice, argued in the Knesset, “We are at war with our neighbors, the Palestinians.” Another MP, Yuval Steinitz, called cross-border Palestinian marriages “a deliberate strategy … to change the demographic balance in Israel in order to destroy us.” The Israeli government claimed that the CEL was a temporary measure for self-defense against terrorism, and the Israeli Supreme Court later narrowly upheld it as compatible with civil rights. It was renewed annually until Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party, which had lost office, temporarily blocked renewal in July 2021 (although it supports the law and wishes to make it permanent) in a stunt to embarrass the new government of Prime Minister Neftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid.\n\nLapid tweeted that the law’s “essence” is that it will “ensure a Jewish majority in the state of Israel.” Nine of 11 cabinet members supported the CEL and got it through the Knesset in March.\n\nThe CEL makes utterly clear the ethno-nationalist and discriminatory nature of the Israeli state. President Joe Biden has maintained the enormous U.S. imperialist support for this regime. And even one of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Democratic congresspeople, Jamaal Bowman, met amiably with Bennett and Lapid in November 2021 — at the very same time that they were working to renew the CEL.\n\nThe Zionist state must be overthrown by the Palestinian masses, with help from the working classes of neighboring Arab countries and support from the international Left. It must be replaced with a democratic, secular, socialist state in which Arabs and Jews can live together and both have full civil rights. This includes abolishing the Zionist borders partitioning Palestine and establishing the full Right of Return for the millions of Palestinian exiles.\n\nThe U.S. Left will never succeed if we sell out Palestinians while striving to form a pressure group within the Democratic Party and the U.S. government. Socialism can only be created by what Trotsky called “an awakening of human personality in the masses — who were supposed to possess no personality.” Publicizing the dignity and resistance of oppressed people and the facts of their oppression, rather than making political accommodations with oppressors, is indispensable for international working-class action.\n\nLeft-wing workers organizing to push back against our exploitation by Amazon, Starbucks, and the rest of the U.S. capitalist class need to call out everything happening in Palestine in solidarity with the Palestinian masses, not accept “Left” politicians seeking serviceable apologetic things to say while participating in government meetings maintaining imperialist alliances. Congressional offices do not have the magical power to change society. Real power comes from radical honesty about social relations. Only if we have that can increasing numbers of workers develop the conviction to fight capitalism and oppression where we live and internationally. It is no coincidence that Palestine has shown more strikingly than any other issue the debilitating effect of Democratic Party electoralism.', 'image': 'https://www.leftvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/al-aqsa-israeli-forces-aim-baton-15apr2022-afp-edit.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:37'}

The soldiers responded with riot dispersal means and live ammunition.”\n\nClashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians are common in the West Bank, a territory occupied by Israel since 1967, but recent weeks have seen a surge in unrest.\n\nAttacks by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs in Israel have killed 14 people since late March, while Oweidat is among 25 Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, among them assailants, killed by Israeli forces over the same period.\n\nHis body, wrapped in the Palestinian flag and that of the president Mahmud Abbas’s Fatah movement, was driven from a Ramallah hospital to Jericho for his burial, where hundreds of mourners enduring 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat surrounded the Oweidat family home. As the body left the family home, Oweidat’s mother wailed as she gave her son a final embrace.\n\nViolent clashes have also recently rocked the compound of the Al-Aqsa mosque in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, sparking fears of another armed conflict after an 11-day war last year between Israel and armed groups in the Gaza Strip, triggered by similar unrest.\n\nFollowing the Al-Aqsa clashes, isolated rocket fire toward Israel from Gaza resumed, prompting Israeli reprisals on targets linked to Hamas, the Islamist group which controls the coastal Palestinian enclave. No injuries have been reported on either side as a result of the rocket fire or retaliatory air strikes.\n\nIsrael on Saturday had closed the Erez crossing with Gaza in retaliation for the rocket fire, blocking the 12,000 Palestinians with permits to enter the Jewish state from going to work.\n\nBut Erez re-opened Monday “following a security assessment,” Israel’s defense ministry said, warning that a sustained opening was conditioned on “the continued preservation of a stable security situation.”\n\nNo rockets have been fired from Gaza since Saturday morning.\n\nConcerns of fresh Al-Aqsa clashes are building, though, ahead of Friday prayers at the compound, with the end of Ramadan also approaching in early May.\n\nPalestinian Muslims have been angered by an uptick in Jewish visits to the Al-Aqsa compound, Islam’s third-holiest site. It is also Judaism’s holiest place and known to Jews as the Temple Mount.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to ease tensions, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told reporters Sunday that Israel was committed to the “status quo” at Al-Aqsa, meaning an adherence to long-standing convention allowing Jews to visit the compound but not pray there.', 'image': 'https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/main-image/2022/04/26/3197181-1342594130.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:28:11'}

In recent years, Israel has performed hundreds of air attacks on shipments of Iranian-made systems that Israel says were on their way to Lebanon via Syria.\n\nThis development, the Israeli sources add, is believed to be a direct result of Russia looking to pull forces from Syria to help reinforce and reinvigorate its military in Ukraine, which has been heavily depleted by the surprisingly effective Ukrainian defense.\n\nEarlier this month, a top advisor to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad told the BBC that Iranian forces are welcome inside the country’s borders.\n\n“We are in a state of war and we have the right to receive assistance and expertise from whoever we see fit,” the advisor, Luna Chebel, said. “Yes, there are Iranian military experts in Syria, and they provide expertise to the Syrian Arab army. They come and they go. The state of Syria is at war and has the right to ask for help from its ally.”\n\nIsraeli sources say that this shift in control is especially seen in strategic areas, like the city of Aleppo and in the Mohin warehouse area, located in the eastern rural area of Homs. It was not clear exactly how many forces are moving into the region from Iran, though sources indicated the number is in the hundreds. In late March The New York Times reported some Russian forces, including mercenaries with the infamous Wagner group, had been pulled from Syria and Libya to deploy to Ukraine.\n\nSimultaneously with the withdrawals, Iranian militias, under the supervision of IRGC members, began building new headquarters and warehouses, Israeli intelligence sources said. This in addition to setting up a new training camp on the outskirts of Aleppo to train members of the Lebanese Hezbollah militia. The sources say that Iran is “determined” to have greater sway in Syria. Local sources on the ground in Syria also spoke of Iranian militias transporting weapons and ammunition from the Homs and Hama countryside to the Aleppo countryside to secure them at recently prepared sites, while they’ve emptied the old ones at the request of the senior military leadership of the IRGC, according to Israeli sources.\n\nIran’s expansion plan was not limited to the establishment of headquarters or an increase in military deployment, but was extended to the establishment of a new militia, which is closest to the elite forces model, to carry out the tasks previously carried out by the retreating Russian forces. Last week the Saudi Al-Hadath channel reported that an underground Iranian facility in Syria dubbed “Project 99” is developing ballistic missiles, chemical weapons and UAVs, and is under the control of Hezbollah and the IRGC.\n\nThe departure of Russian forces is not expected to change Israel’s calculus in Syria, as the Russian S-400 air defense systems remain in place. Israel maintains a careful political balance between the US, it’s closest partner, and Russia, whom it needs to work with to ensure limited access to Syria for strikes against Iranian-backed targets and weapons convoys.\n\nThe increased presence of IRGC forces in Syria could prompt Israel to strike more directly at the Iranian forces, as it reportedly did last month killing two IRGC members, in what could be the next potential test for its relationship with Moscow.', 'image': 'https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220425_syrian_forces_lebanon_GettyImages-52698006-scaled-e1650915098573-1024x576.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:28:02'}

It includes new American battlefield aerial drones and the most modern U.S. and Canadian artillery, anti-tank weapons from Norway and others, armoured vehicles and anti-ship missiles from Britain and Stinger counter-air missiles from the U.S., Denmark and other countries.\n\nIf Ukraine can hold off the Russians, its accumulating arsenal of Western weapons could have a transformative effect in a country that has, like other former Soviet republics, relied mainly on arms and equipment from the Soviet era.\n\nBut sustaining that military aid won\'t be easy. It is costly and, for some supplier nations, politically risky. It also is being taken out of Western stockpiles that at some point will need to be replenished. That is why U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin convened a meeting Tuesday at Germany\'s Ramstein air base to work out ways to keep it going, now and for the long run. Defense ministers and top military leaders from approximately 40 countries participated.\n\nAfter the meeting, Austin told a news conference at Ramstein that Germany had agreed to send 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine and that the meeting had served to unify the West\'s efforts to help Ukraine "win today and build strength for tomorrow." He said the participating nations had agreed to continue similar consultations through monthly meetings, either in person or virtually.\n\n"We\'ve got to move at the speed of war," Austin said.\n\nThe goal, Austin said ahead of the conference, is not just to support Ukrainian defenses but to help them prevail against a larger invading force. In opening remarks to the meeting, he said Ukraine\'s allies will "keep moving heaven and earth" to meet Ukraine\'s near-term security requirements.\n\n"We believe they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support," Austin said on Monday in Poland after returning from a visit to Kyiv with Secretary of State Antony Blinken that included discussion of Ukraine\'s military needs. He also said the goal is to "see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things it has done in invading Ukraine."\n\nDespite its early failings, the Russian military still holds some advantages that will be put to the test in the eastern Donbas region, where they are assembling more combat troops and firepower even as the U.S. and its NATO allies scramble to get artillery and other heavy weaponry to that area in time to make a difference.\n\nWith the war\'s outcome in doubt after two months of fighting, the Pentagon is providing 90 of the U.S. Army\'s most modern howitzers, along with 183,000 rounds of artillery -- and other sophisticated weaponry that could give the Ukrainians an important edge in looming battles. The U.S. also is arranging more training for Ukrainians on key weaponry, including howitzers and at least two kinds of armed drone aircraft.\n\nOn Monday, Austin and Blinken announced $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries in Europe; some $322 million is earmarked for Kyiv, in part to help Ukraine transition to more advanced weapons and air defense systems. The remainder will be split among NATO members and other nations that have provided Ukraine with critical military supplies since the war with Russia began, officials said.\n\nSuch financing is different from previous U.S. military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of weapons and equipment from Pentagon stockpiles but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need.\n\nThe Ukrainians say they need even more, including long-range air defense systems, fighter jets, tanks and multiple-launch rocket systems.\n\n"It will be true to say that the United States now leads the effort in ensuring this transition of Ukraine to Western-style weapons, in arranging training for Ukrainian soldiers," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said, adding, "and I only regret that it didn\'t happen a month or two months ago from the very beginning of the war."\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. general who led NATO in Europe from 2013 to 2016, says his shorthand summary of what Putin wants in Ukraine and elsewhere on the Russian periphery is, "Weapons out, NATO back, and no America."\n\n"What has happened is, Mr. Putin is getting exactly what he did not want. He\'s getting more weapons forward, he\'s getting more NATO forward, and he\'s getting more America in Europe," Breedlove said in an interview.\n\nThe complexities of keeping up Western military aid to Ukraine, even as its troops are fully occupied with a brutal war, are a reminder of what is at stake. Putin said before launching the invasion that Moscow could not tolerate what he saw as a Western effort to make Ukraine a de facto member of NATO. He argued that Ukraine\'s interest in westernizing and in remaining outside of Russia\'s orbit was due to "external forces" such as U.S. pressure.\n\nPutin has demanded that Ukraine forswear membership in the NATO alliance, and beyond that he has insisted on turning back the clock to 1997, before NATO had begun adding former Soviet and Soviet-allied nations to its ranks.\n\nThere is little prospect of Ukraine joining NATO, but Russia\'s war has in fact brought NATO closer to Ukraine. The result has been a boost to Ukraine\'s prospects for mounting a successful defense, even in the eastern Donbas region where the Russians hold certain advantages and where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014.\n\n------\n\nAP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2022/4/26/putin-1-5876684-1650988870257.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:44'}

This and the pacing threat of China are necessary for planning the production of weapons and services by our military industry. But they are not nearly enough for the new era ushered in by\u200b Vladimir Putin’s war.\n\nTrue, the supplying of two particular weapon systems so far has put a significant dent in our stockpiles. We have sent Ukraine 33 percent of our Javelins — a portable anti-tank missile — and around 25 percent of our Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. The Pentagon has quite rightly said these must be replenished — or better still, replaced by more capable newer models. And as there is no indication that the war will end any time soon, we must assume the requirement for resupply will continue and even increase.\n\nThe mix of weapons will likely also change over time. Already, the Ukrainian president is asking for HIMRAS (rocket launchers), helicopters and drones. For effective use of these weapons, the Ukrainians will need training and sustainment assistance. The United States and/or NATO will need to organize quickly for this mission, perhaps by establishing a Military Assistance Command to train and sustain the Ukrainian forces. Such a step will also assist with the coordination of resupply operations among allies.\n\nBut the message to our defense industrial complex must be to go beyond replenishment of what we are sending to Ukraine. We are in an unfortunate and stark global era after the Russian invasion. The unprovoked aggression represents a sea change in the international security environment. This change requires a major expansion of our defense industrial base that addresses four urgent needs:\n\nFirst, resupply allies and partners. They too have expended significant percentages of their own weapon stockpiles and face the same exigent need to backfill those readiness depots. The Russian invasion has educated Europeans about their continent’s security environment and collective security. Astonishingly, Finland and Sweden are now leaning toward joining NATO, and many others — Germany, in particular — are willing to spend significantly more on defense. This is very positive. The willingness to upgrade defense spending will also mean purchasing new and more powerful weapons to replace old and ineffective systems. Our defense industrial base should prepare to help them meet this important goal.\n\nSecond, the poor performance of Russian armed forces in Ukraine will cause those who have been relying on Russian systems, such as India, to reconsider those investments and future purchases. Additionally, the G-7 sanctions on Russia will undermine its ability to provide weapons in the numbers that Moscow had anticipated or provide the spare parts needed for systems already provided. This presents an opportunity to decrease Indian dependence on Russian weapons in key areas. India’s dependence on Russia for fighter jets, missiles and air defense systems has precipitated its ambivalent response to Russia’s naked aggression. Reducing key countries’ — especially India’s — dependence on Russia should guide both our strategy and how we map the path our military industry policy follows.\n\nThird, the conflict has substantially increased the importance of Saudi Arabia’s capacity for increased oil production. The Biden administration has had frosty relations with Riyadh. Unlike the previous administration, the White House has kept Riyadh at arm’s length diplomatically and even denied or delayed the sale of several weapon systems. Now the administration is in the process of urgently attempting to reset these relations. A key component of this reset will be the increase in arms sales to help Saudi Arabia deal with the threat from Iran and its proxies, especially the Houthis, who have launched more than 800 attacks against Saudi Arabia, including some attacks against its major cities.\n\nFourth, this war has impacted geopolitical and security calculations beyond Europe. Indo-Pacific countries are now faced with potential conflict in their region involving China or North Korea that could start with little notice. The result would be catastrophic. This illuminates an urgent need to pre-position appropriate weapons in Taiwan for its defense in case of Chinese aggression. Unlike Ukraine, Taiwan’s island disposition makes resupply immensely complex once hostilities are initiated. The administration has been lukewarm in its attitude towards the sale of U.S. arms to Taiwan. This must change. The supply of naval helicopters to Taiwan would \u200bbe an important first step.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine requires a significant change in the tone, tenor and tempo of our foreign military sales. Ukraine demonstrates that our allies and partners need the military capability to defend themselves against aggression with little or no notice. This would act as a deterrent.\n\nThe U.S. military-industrial base is an essential instrument and bulwark against the multiple security threats that we and our allies and our partners face. Steadily rebuilding and upgrading the supply chain demands that we stay at the forefront of innovation and redouble our commitment and investment in research and development.\n\nCreating new financing and contracting options, including public-private partnerships, will also support deeper investment in the manufacturing facilities of our key producers. Surging production must be accompanied by reducing foreign supplier dependence, which, unless addressed, can be an unintended problem for the global supply chain in a significant and prolonged regional crisis and conflict. These steps are fundamental components of preserving both our national security and our role as global leaders.\n\nThe expansion of our defense industrial base must also include addressing as soon as possible important shortages in capabilities for the current security environment. For example, we have a critical shortage of Patriot Missile defense systems, and Saudi Arabia’s security depends upon that air-defense coverage. We have not yet provided Riyadh with a Patriot battery since we withdrew the one we had provided for servicing. As a result, the Houthis were emboldened and our relations with the kingdom suffered. Iraqi Kurdistan is rocketed frequently by Iran and its proxies as well; it, too, needs Patriot missiles, or it may have no choice but to accommodate Iran.\n\nOur military/industry base must be revitalized and expanded in order to deal with the geopolitical challenges we face in the years and decades ahead. This is an essential problem but can be overcome. Addressing it requires national commitment and resources, public-private partnership and bold leadership from the White House, the Pentagon and Congress. We cannot afford not to rise to this challenge.\n\nZalmay Khalilzad was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

The nine detainees were able to reunite with their loved ones again and share with them the participation in the rites of Easter, celebrated by the Coptic Churches on Sunday, April 24. All of them were accused of attempting against public safety by participating in illegal meetings, and also of distributing a video on the Internet criticizing the authorities for the delays in the reconstruction of the destroyed church, which had been authorized for more than a year. On March 30, Amnesty International called on the Egyptian government to release the nine Christians who had been "arbitrarily" detained for two months. The question of the construction and rebuilding of Christian places of worship has always been a source of tension and regular conflict between the Christian communities in Egypt and the local authorities. Until 2016, the construction of new Christian places of worship was still conditioned and, in fact, hampered by the so-called "10 rules" added in 1934 to the Ottoman legislation by the Ministry of the Interior, which prohibited, among other things, the construction of new churches near schools, canals, government buildings, railways, and residential areas. In many cases, the strict application of these regulations had prevented the construction of churches in cities and towns inhabited by Christians, especially in rural areas of Upper Egypt. In the decades following the imposition of the "ten rules", many churches and chapels were built all over Egypt spontaneously, without the necessary permits. Even today, these buildings, erected by local Christian communities without legal permission, are still used from time to time as a pretext by mob groups to foment sectarian violence. The new law on places of worship, ratified by the Egyptian Parliament in August 2016, also made it possible to start a methodical process of "legalizing" Christian places of worship built in the past without the necessary permits. The government commission created for this purpose has met on 20 occasions and on each of them has given its approval to the legal regularization of churches and buildings that were previously considered totally or partially not authorized by law. Recently, illustrating the guiding criteria for the massive urbanization plans applied by Egyptian political leaders (see Fides, 7/3/2022), Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi reiterated that newly built cities must include the construction of a church in its urban and regulatory plans, although this place of Christian worship is attended and used by a small number of baptized people.

This piece reflects the views of the author and does not necessarily represent those of Religion Unplugged, its staff and contributors.\n\n(OPINION) The various Christian denominations in Egypt celebrate Easter on different dates during April. For each of them, it is a season of sober reflection and joyful celebration. It is a time for prayer, worship and praise — albeit in distinctly different styles — as they commemorate the life-giving death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nThis year, Egyptian Christians attended their churches and cathedrals boldly, in spite of the looming threat posed to such a basic exercise of religious freedom. Many of the most prominent churches and cathedrals had armed guards in case of an attack by Islamic extremists. This line of defense is not new, and when there have been attacks, it only goes so far in mitigating the loss of life.\n\nEgyptian Christians are courageous, determined, resilient and faithful in the face of threats of repression, hatred and persecution. They not only have Christ as their greatest example but also a founder in St. Mark the Evangelist, who according to the traditions of the church was brutally martyred by pagans at Easter in April of 68 A.D. After the gospel writer’s martyrdom, scores have followed him down that path in the almost 2,000 years since. It is with good reason that the Egyptian church is known as the “Church of the Martyrs.”\n\nHowever, along with that spirit of boldness and culture of faith, it would be understandable if there was some apprehension as Egyptian Christians contemplated their gatherings as congregations this past Easter. It marked the fifth anniversary of the twin suicide bombings that targeted St. George’s Coptic Orthodox Church in Tanta and St. Mark’s Coptic Cathedral in Cairo on Palm Sunday 2017. More than 70 were killed in those attacks.\n\nDuring this month alone, a Coptic priest, Father Arsanios Wadeed, was stabbed to death in Alexandria while taking his youth group on an outing. Father Wadeed had endured violent threats at various points in his ministry. Also this month, a Christian woman was kidnapped and forced by her abductors to change her religion to Islam and to make public her forced conversion on social media. Amid public outrage, authorities were able to secure her release and return to her family just over a week after her kidnapping, a welcome but far too infrequent outcome for incidents such as this.\n\nEgypt is a country of contrasts when it comes to all kinds of human rights, including religious freedom. In spite of the recent acts of savage inhumanity, many Christians would argue that it’s the most free and peaceful time they’ve known. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi presents himself as a defender of the Christian community, which represents about 10% of the population. He has made some surprising statements under no apparent pressure to do so. In October last year, he said, “If someone tells me they are neither Muslim nor Christian nor a Jew or that he or she does not believe in religion, I will tell them, ‘You are free to choose.’” It’s hard to overemphasize the power and controversy of such a statement.\n\nIn March el-Sissi gave a speech at the opening of a housing development with another comment likely to stir feelings of anger from hardliners and hope from the less skeptical Christians. In relation to his urbanization program, el-Sissi commanded, “Where there is a mosque … there must also be a church.” Since the passage of a 2016 law on the building and restoration of churches, more than 2,400 approvals have been granted out of the 3,730 that have applied.\n\nDespite these positive developments, there remain problematic laws, such as Article 98/f of the criminal code, which outlaws the “defamation of religions.” It’s another example of the region’s amorphous blasphemy laws — vague enough to be used at will as a stick to beat minority religious groups. Another example is a ban on Baha’i, which has no place in a civilized society. Peaceful religions should be permitted and enabled to exercise their beliefs with freedom.\n\nHowever, many of the most acute challenges and most deplorable violations of religious freedom do not emanate from the national government but from local authorities and communities. There is only limited value in even the most progressive proclamations from the top of government if these sentiments are not filtering down to those tasked with implementing policy and enforcing the law.\n\nIf the president is serious about advancing human rights in Egypt, intelligent programs focused on education and influence must be rolled out. Ensuring robust religious freedom, or free exercise equality, isn’t just a humane way of treating one’s citizens — it contributes to flourishing societies with greater stability and security.\n\nCivil servants, law enforcement agents and other key actors throughout every governorate of Egypt must be trained to understand the benefits for all citizens. Imams and ministers with oversight of all Egypt’s religious communities should be supported so that they’re well-equipped to dispel anxieties about the religious implications of liberty. And schools should be provided with curricula that will secure more peaceful and civil communities in future generations. This is not a small undertaking, but these are the actions required if there’s a genuine desire to achieve change. Egypt is one of the world’s great nations, and it is at a point in its history when it can grasp a more dignified, righteous and secure future for all its citizens.\n\nAs Egyptian Christians made their way to their Easter services, they continued to walk in the footprints of their forebears — and their savior. They trust God. They are not afraid. They endure with dignity through all hardship and suffering, and through faith and in God-given strength, they will prevail. But Egypt must work harder to defend its children. It can seize a brighter future of peace and justice for all if the will is there.\n\nMiles P.J.

There are no more documents left to produce by President Trump.”\n\nShe also derided the James probe as a “political crusade” and “truly a fishing expedition,” saying Trump and his companies had turned over more than 6 million documents and paperwork related to 103 Trump entities for an eight-year period.\n\n“We’ve turned over everything as fast as possible. This is a waste of judicial resources,” Habba added.\n\nShe also defended Trump’s character, saying: “My client is an honest person much to the dismay of certain people in this room.”\n\nTrump spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nInvestigators for James have said in court filings that they uncovered evidence that Trump may have misstated the value of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers on his financial statements for more than a decade.\n\nAt the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Amer said the investigation was being hampered “because we don’t have evidence from the person at the top of this organization.”\n\nAnd he said the failure to turn documents over in response to the subpoena was “effectively Mr. Trump thumbing his nose at this court’s order.”\n\nStill, Assistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace signaled the probe was about to move to a new phase, saying: “We plan to bring enforcement action in the near future.”\n\nA parallel criminal investigation is being conducted by the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, also a Democrat.\n\nMonday’s contempt finding was not the first for someone who has held the nation’s highest office.\n\nWhile in the White House, then-President Bill Clinton was found in civil contempt of court in April 1999 in connection to his deposition in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him in Arkansas by Paula Jones.\n\nJudge Susan Webber Wright held him in contempt for his testimony, where he falsely said he hadn’t had a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

the attempt to topple the government.\n\nThe judgement is almost certain to attract a chorus of condemnation from Turkey’s main allies in the NATO defense alliance.\n\nThe court’s ruling drew boos from a packed audience that included Western diplomats who have been trying to stress the importance of rights issues and judicial independence in their relations with Ankara.\n\nEmma Sinclair-Webb of Human Rights Watch called it “the worst possible outcome to this show trial”.\n\n“Today, we have witnessed a travesty of justice of spectacular proportions,” Amnesty International’s Europe director Nils Muiznieks added.\n\nKavala’s attorneys immediately vowed to appeal.\n\n‘Conspiracy theories’\n\nThe Paris-born philanthropist told the court by video link form his high-security prison near Istanbul that he viewed the entire process as a “judicial assassination”.\n\n“These are conspiracy theories drafted on political and ideological grounds,” Kavala told the court moments before the sentence.\n\nThe three judges took less than hour to issue their sentence in one of Turkey’s most high-profile trials in years.\n\nThe marathon hearing has been gnawing on Turkey’s strategic but tempestuous ties with its main Western allies since Kavala’s unexpected arrest in October 2017.\n\nThe 64-year-old was then best known as a soft-spoken businessman who was using a part of his wealth to promote culture and projects aimed at reconciling Turkey and its arch-nemesis Armenia.\n\nBut President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan portrayed him as a leftist agent of the Hungarian-born US billionaire George Soros who was accused of using foreign money to try and topple the state.\n\n“We can never be together with people like Kavala,” Erdoğan declared in 2020.\n\nAlternating charges\n\nTens of thousands of people ended up being jailed or stripped of their government jobs in the purges that followed the coup attempt.\n\nBut the seemingly arbitrary nature of the alternating charges filed against Kavala made him into a symbol for international rights groups — as well as Western governments — of Erdoğan’s increasing authoritarian streak in the second decade of his rule.\n\nKavala was first charged with funding a wave of 2013 protests that some analysts view as the genesis of Erdoğan’s more authoritarian streak in the latter half of his 20-year rule.\n\nThat count did not stick.\n\nA court acquitted and released him in February 2020 — only for the police to arrest him before he had a chance to return home to his wife.\n\nAnother court then accused him of being involved in the failed but bloody 2016 coup attempt that unleashed a years-long crackdown in which tens of thousands were either jailed or stripped of their government jobs.\n\nKavala ultimately ended up being charged with both counts.\n\nHis treatment prompted the Council of Europe to launch rare disciplinary proceedings that could ultimately see Turkey’s membership suspended in the continent’s main human rights grouping.\n\nMuted by Ukraine war\n\nYet the case’s importance to Turkey’s broader diplomatic standing has been somewhat muted by Russia’s two-month war in Ukraine.\n\nErdoğan has been leveraging his relatively good ties with both Moscow and Kyiv to try and mediate an end to the war.\n\nHis efforts have already seen a marked improvement in Ankara’s relations with Washington that could soon see Turkey supplied with US military jets.\n\nMonday’s hearing was held in İstanbul at the same time as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres met Erdoğan in Ankara before travelling to Moscow and Kyiv later in the week.\n\n“The Secretary-General expressed his support for Turkey’s on-going diplomatic efforts in relation to the war in Ukraine,” Guterres’s office said after the talks.\n\nErdoğan did not mention Kavala in a national television address that began moments after the verdict’s release.\n\nHis office instead said that the Turkish leader planned to discuss Ukraine with Russia President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.\n\nTake a second to support Stockholm Center for Freedom on Patreon!', 'image':

Bahrain, a small Persian Gulf island state, immediately joined the Accords; Sudan and Morocco also normalized relations with Israel later in the year. Other Arab nations, most notably Saudi Arabia, are known to maintain furtive political and economic ties with Israel, although they have not yet formally normalized their relations. Other Middle Eastern countries, most notably Iran, have definitively ruled out such normalizations.\n\nThe proposed legislation appears to have come in response to a conference that took place in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, in September. At that conference, around 300 Iraqi political and economic leaders discussed Baghdad’s entry into the Abraham Accords, which they suggested would lead to economic benefits for the country. Sadr harshly criticized that meeting, insisting that the country’s leadership “must forbid such terrorist Zionist meetings” and calling for the attendees to be arrested.\n\nSadr’s ties to Iran are a matter of continued controversy. During the U.S. occupation of Iraq from 2003 until 2010, the cleric fought against American troops and sought sanctuary within Iran from 2007 until 2011. However, his supporters also played a significant role in the October 2019 protest movement against the government of Iraqi prime minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi, whose foreign policy was closely aligned with Tehran’s. Sadr’s victory in Iraq’s October 2021 parliamentary elections largely came at the expense of pro-Iranian political parties and militia groups, who initially insisted that the results had been fraudulent and vowed not to accept them.\n\nTrevor Filseth is a current and foreign affairs writer for the National Interest.\n\nImage: Reuters.', 'image': 'https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/sadr_0.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:21'}

These talks were suspended seven months ago. Meanwhile Iraq along with Israel, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab Gulf Oil states are angry with the Americans because the U.S. is not only offering Iran a revival of the 2015 sanctions treaty, but also a modification of the terms to make it easier for Iran to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. While those talks are currently stalled, the U.S. quietly agreed to allow South Korea to release several billion dollars to Iran while Britain released half a billion to Iran for a payment dispute from the 1970s. A primary Iranian demand in the negotiations is that billions of dollars in frozen accounts be returned to Iran. Iran saw the 2015 treaty suspended by the Americans in 2018 because of Iranian cheating. Then came the 2020 American presidential elections, which put into power a new president who adopted more favorable policies towards Iran and reduced support for Arab resistance to Iranian violence. This caused many Gulf oil states to join an economic alliance with Russia to drive up the price of oil. This policy makes it easier for Iran to smuggle more of its heavily discounted oil to customers. That plan survived the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine and even more economic sanctions. Opposition in the United States to reviving the 2015 treaty, especially from senior military and political officials, is making a difference but the official policy is still to give the Iranians what they want in return for promises Iran has broken before. That has recently been modified to include U.S. assurances that sanctions on Iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons organizations and key individuals will not be expanded. Iraq, Israel and its Arab allies are not impressed.\n\nBecause of this new American attitude, Israel has carried out several major attacks on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. Some earlier attacks were in cooperation with the United States but the most recent ones were done with only the help of Iranians who also oppose the nuclear weapons and the current Iranian religious dictatorship. Israel makes it clear it will launch a major air and missile strike against the Iranian nuclear program if Iran gets close to creating a working nuclear weapon. Israel’s new allies among the Arab Persian Gulf oil states will cooperate with such an attack, as they are already being hit by Iranian missiles, cruise missiles and guided rockets.\n\nIsrael has had locally developed nuclear weapons since 1970 and portrays these weapons as the ultimate deterrent to any serious effort to destroy Israel. The Israeli nukes can be delivered deliver several ways. This first method was aircraft-delivered gravity bombs and later air-to ground missiles. Then came ballistic missiles plus cruise missiles that can be launched via torpedo tubes from a submerged Israeli sub. Israel never acknowledged it has nukes and continues to maintain them and several delivery systems. This has deterred everyone except Iran, which since the 1980s has been ruled by a religious dictatorship that was obsessed with destroying Israel.\n\nIran Paralyzes New Government\n\nIraqi efforts to form a new government after the presidential elections in late 2021 have been blocked by a pro-Iran coalition of various Shia and Kurdish groups, plus a few Sunni factions that oppose a government dominated by powerful Iraqi Shia cleric Muqtada al Sadr. This opposition prevents a two- thirds quorum of parliament members from forming and voting on who gets what post in a new government. Israel has a similar form of government and often faces a stalemate in forming a new government coalition. Often a few small, often radical, Israeli factions make a quorum possible and then force the new government to meet their demands or see the government collapse. Iraq seems headed in the same direction and that is progress for Iraq, one of the few functioning democracies in the Middle East.\n\nThe election was won by pro-Sadr parties that regard Iran and Iraqi government corruption as the most serious problem facing Iraq. Most Iraqi voters agreed with Sadr, who demanded that all militias be disarmed and disbanded. This demand was aimed at Iran, which has used the militias to create a legal Iran-backed armed force in Iraq. Calls for disbanding these militias have been gaining a lot more support since 2017. The 2021 elections mean an even more anti-Iran government and, sensing what that would mean for militias in general, most militias have announced plans to disband. Disarming is another matter. Despite that, Sadr’s efforts to clean up some of the corruption has made visible progress. Less corruption is often measured by international organizations. For example. in 2021 Iraq showed continued progress in reducing corruption. The pro-Iran groups see Sadr’s efforts as devastating to Iranian influence in Iraq if Sadr succeeds. Some Kurdish and Sunni Arab factions see Sadr as a greater threat to them than Iran. The anti-Sadr coalition isn’t large enough to form their own government but so far, the anti-Sadr coalition has prevented the formation of a government dominated by Sadr. Iraqi allies like the United States and Gulf Arab countries fear Iran more than Sadr and are trying to come up with a compromise.\n\nApril 25, 2022: In the north (Nineveh province) most of the Iraqi 9th division has been deployed around Sinjar as part of an effort to reduce violence between the Turks and PKK and YBS (Sinjar Resistance Unit). There is also one brigade from the 20th division nearby. For years the Turks have been trying to keep PKK from establishing themselves in northern Iraq, especially the town of Sinjar, which has long been dominated by the Kurdish Yazidi faction. The Yazidi were particularly hated by ISIL which tried to wipe them out. ISIL failed, in large part because support for the Yazidi from Kurds Iraqi, Turkish and Syrian Kurds as well as the American military. For that reason, the Yazidi tolerate the continued presence of the PKK. This angered Turkey which, since early 2021, has threatened to send in troops and use lots of airpower to occupy Sinjar if the Iraqi government does not remove PKK from Sinjar and northern Iraq in general. Turkey keeps reminding the Iraqi government that this invasion would occur without warning. Iraq has already sent two Iran-backed PMF (Popular Mobilization Forces) militia brigades to Sinjar as well as an army brigade. That did not impress the PKK, which is still there. This is why most of the 9th division is now arriving.\n\nIraqis don’t want to fight the Kurds or Turks. YBS is a Yazidi Kurd militia aligned with the PKK. Despite YBS activity in northern Syria and Iraq, most Yazidis want nothing to do with the PKK aligned YBS. Separatist Kurds have been a growing problem in Turkey. Syria. Iran and Iran for over a century. The Yazidi are Kurds who practice a pre-Christian religion related to the pre-Islamic Zoroastrian religion once common in Iran before Islam and now only found in India. The Yazidis are considered pagans by ISIL and to Moslems pagans must either renounce their beliefs or die. The Kurds have always gotten along better with Yazidis, Christians and other minorities and many of those people fled to the Kurdish north. In 2015 it was the Kurds who recaptured Yazidi territory from ISIL.\n\nApril 24, 2022: In the northwest (Muthanna province) Iran-backed militia attacked an American supply convoy with a roadside bomb. There were no injuries and the convoy continued. These convoy attacks are increasingly frequent but rarely use a powerful enough or effectively placed bomb to do any real damage. This reflects the loss of competent bomb makers by most terror groups in Iraq because of increased counter-terrorism efforts.\n\nApril 23, 2022: In central Iraq (Saladin, or Salahuddin, Province) two policemen were killed and two wounded by an ISIL (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) bomb during a major sweep of the area for ISIL personnel or bases. This operation also involves Diyala, Samarra, Kirkuk provinces further north. Last month there was a similar operation in Nineveh, Saladin, and Anbar provinces.\n\nApril 22, 2022: The World Bank predicted that Iraq, despite a larger population (41 million), would enjoy the highest GDP growth (8.9 percent) in the region because of higher oil prices and improved administration of the economy despite the political deadlock over forming a new government. The 2021 elections made it clear that most voters wanted less corruption and more effective government policies.\n\nApril 17, 2022: In the Kurdish north (Metina province, near the Turkish border) Turkish troops, with artillery and air support, launched a major operation against PKK (Turkish Kurd separatists) that lasted several days and left 45 PKK men dead or captured. Three Turkish soldiers were killed and several wounded. Several PKK bases and weapons storage sites were found and destroyed. Such Turkish incursions against the PKK in northern Iraq have been going on for years.\n\nApril 11, 2022: Iran-backed Shia militias sold RPG anti-tank launchers and warheads along with two Iraqi army MRLS (multiple rocket launcher systems) and the unguided rockets it uses to Iran, which smuggled them to Russia via Iran across the Caspian Sea, a landlocked body of water bordering Iran and Russia. Russia has been more cooperative with Iranian forces in Syria because of this while seeking not to anger the Israelis. China has refused to supply Russia with weapons but Iran is already suffering many sanctions and Russia is one of the few allies it has. Iraq is one of the most corrupt nations in the Middle East and anything is available if you have the cash or enough gunmen to obtain what you want. Most Iraqis consider the corruption a flaw to be corrected while Iran considers the Iraqi corruption something Iran can make use of.\n\nMarch 27, 2022: In the north (Nineveh province) work began on a border wall on the Syrian border. The first stage will be 10 kilometers long and 3.5 meters (11 feet) high. Iraq has a 600-kilometer-long border with Syria and the areas most often used by Islamic terrorists and smugglers will be the first to get a wall with new construction covering the new routes the illegal border crossers use. At the very least this makes it more difficult for those crossing the border illegally. Iraq first built a fence along the Syrian border but this was insufficient. Iraq is now joining a growing number of Middle Eastern nations (like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Kuwait) and following the example of Israel by building high-tech security fences or walls along their borders to keep out Islamic terrorists, illegal migrants, criminals and smugglers. The United States covered most of the half billion-dollar cost of the Jordan barrier along its 442 kilometers of borders with Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have done this along their Iraqi borders. Jordan has been the most successful of the Arab countries at protecting itself from Islamic terrorism. But the civil war in Syria and the growing ISIL and Iranian presence in Iraq led Israel, in late 2015 to begin building a security fence on its last unfenced border, the 307-kilometer Jordanian frontier. This project took several years and cost $1.6 billion, plus millions a year to maintain. Israel and Jordan have long cooperated closely on counter-terrorism issues so the Israeli fence also assists Jordan since any Islamic terrorists inside Jordan who are seeking to get into Israel are more likely to be detected and caught.', 'image': 'https://www.strategypage.com/images/ico/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:48'}

Russia still met 44% of Turkey\'s gas demands last year.\n\nNow, even with energy prices soaring, few in Turkey are aware that the country\'s second biggest gas supplier over the past winter was the United States, which shipped it in to meet Turkey\'s high winter gas demand.\n\nThe latest data released at the end of March by Turkey\'s energy market regulator EPDK confirms that for the four months from October through January, the United States supplied 17.4% of Turkey\'s gas imports, well ahead of near neighbors and longtime suppliers Iran (11.9%) and Azerbaijan (12.9%) and second only to Russia (38%).\n\nThe bulk of Turkey\'s gas imports are brought in by state gas importer Botas, and given Turkey\'s often fractious relations with Washington, it would be easy to assume both that there is a political motive behind Ankara\'s recent thirst for US gas and that US gas producers have been earning huge profits from Turkey amid the recent spike in gas prices. This is far from the case.\n\nSince the discovery a decade or so ago that the United States holds the world\'s third largest reserves of shale gas, production has soared, with the bulk being exported as LNG to buyers in Europe, including Turkey.\n\n"There has been a major redivision of the global LNG market. Europe as a whole is getting much more gas from the US, and Turkey is part of that," explained David Tonge, head of Istanbul-based consultancy IBS.\n\nThat redivision has seen Qatar, formerly a major LNG supplier to Turkey, now shipping most of its gas to south Asia and the far east.\n\nTonge explained that it is also far from true that US LNG producers are enjoying astronomical profits as gas prices soared through last winter and in the wake of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHe pointed out that Botas buys LNG mainly through tenders for multiple cargoes from LNG wholesale companies like BP, Shell, Vitol and Total, who in turn have long-term contracts with LNG producers in the United States and other LNG-exporting countries.\n\n"It\'s these wholesale companies that are making the huge profits more than the US producers," he said, pointing out that gas prices on the Netherlands-based TTF market, used by many companies including BOTAS as a basis for pricing, are five to six times what they were only a year ago.\n\nHistorically high prices aside, Turkey\'s thirst for US LNG is likely to be short lived.\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine has forced the European Union to look for alternatives to the 155 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Russian gas it imported last year.\n\nOn March 25, US President Joe Biden announced an agreement for the United States to supply Europe with an additional 15 bcm of LNG a year. Whether he can actually deliver is unclear, as LNG is exported by wholesalers buying from producers and not by the US government. And even if it happens, the supply would replace less than 10% of Russian imports, meaning Europe will look to other LNG exporters to supply increased volumes.\n\nHowever, it is clear that increased European LNG demand means that Turkey will face increased competition for what is effectively a limited resource.\n\n"Global LNG production is pretty much at full capacity and no major new production trains will come on stream before 2025," explained Tonge, pointing out that if demand increases, prices can only rise further.\n\nAlternatives needed\n\nWith LNG imports from the United States and Turkey\'s other suppliers including Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria meeting close to 40% of Turkish gas demands last winter, Ankara, which is already heavily subsidizing gas sales to consumers, must quickly find alternatives to LNG.\n\nTurkey\'s own Sakarya gas field in the Black Sea, slated to start producing next year, will help, but initial production will be only around 3.5 bcm a year and isn\'t scheduled to reach the planned 15 bcm per year until 2030.\n\nOther short-term options exist but may require delicate negotiation with Turkey\'s eastern neighbors.\n\n"There are a number of options for bringing more gas to Turkey through existing pipelines in place of LNG," explained John Roberts, energy analyst and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, pointing to significant spare capacity in the existing pipelines carrying gas to Turkey from both Azerbaijan and Iran and the vast gas reserves in Turkmenistan on the far side of the Caspian Sea.\n\nKey to unlocking this potential, he explained, is a landmark three-way swap agreement signed last December between Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkmenistan, designed to help Azerbaijan meet growing domestic gas demand without reducing its existing exports to Turkey and Europe.\n\nUnder the swap deal, Turkmenistan exports up to 2 bcm a year of gas to northeast Iran, and the same amount is exported from northwest Iran to Azerbaijan.\n\n"That deal could be ramped up to between 5-6 bcm/year to provide extra gas for Turkey, " said Roberts, explaining that the Turkmen gas could reach Turkey either via Azerbaijan and the existing South Caucasus gas pipeline to Turkey, which has 4-5 bcm/year of spare capacity, or via the existing Iran-Turkey pipeline, which also has significant spare capacity.\n\nAlternatively, he suggested, Turkmenistan could export gas to Turkey directly via Iran in an arrangement that would require Tehran and Ashgabat to conclude a separate transit agreement.\n\nSuch an arrangement would not be new. "When Iran started exporting gas to Turkey 21 years ago, Botas tested the gas and found it had originated in Turkmenistan," he said, explaining that Iran had signed a deal to export its own gas to Turkey and was supplying cheap Turkmen gas instead.\n\n"As a transit route it worked before, so it can work again," he said.', 'image': 'https://www.al-monitor.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/2022-04/GettyImages-1010204462.jpg?h=a5ae579a&itok=XkyAmci9', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:28:12'}

The Russian energy sector has still not been directly impacted by the sanctions. But the repercussions are apparent, even as the world is finding it hard to replace Russian oil, gas and coal.\n\nMajor energy industry players are avoiding Russian energy companies as much as they can. This has forced a tightness in the markets and gasoline prices are rising. At the gas station near my Ontario home, the price has hovered around $1.80 a litre over the past few days. This has added to inflationary pressures already created by supply chain issues caused by the pandemic-related chaos.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies are trying to counter by releasing an unprecedented volume of crude from their strategic reserves. And the U.S. is promoting itself as the energy supplier of last resort. Last week, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. is exporting the most oil and petroleum products in history as countries worldwide try to replace Russian supplies. Exports of U.S. crude and petroleum products surged to a weekly record of 10.6 million barrels per day (bpd) during the week ending April 15, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.\n\nYet, the U.S. Administration’s hands are tied. Its efforts to force the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to open their taps don’t seem to be working. It’s been reported recently that leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have refused calls from U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nNow, Fox News and other media outlets are reporting that the U.S. has stopped asking Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to combat the market disruptions. The relationship between the U.S. and the oil-rich kingdom is said to have hit a new low.\n\nBiden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan reportedly brought up the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This angered the prince to the point where he told Sullivan never to mention it again and to forget about Saudi Arabia increasing its oil production, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.\n\nBut during a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the prince agreed to continue maintaining the OPEC+ oil production pact. This was apparently their second such call since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSo OPEC is in a defiant mood. It told the International Monetary Fund’s steering committee on Thursday that the surge in oil prices was largely due to the Ukraine crisis, signalling that the producer group wouldn’t take much further action to add supply.\n\n“Oil prices have been on the rise, particularly in March this year … mainly due to the escalating geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and concerns this might result in large oil supply shortages, amid trade dislocations,” Reuters said, quoting OPEC sources.\n\nAnd all this has made the U.S. realize that it may be impossible for Europe, the main Russian market, to get rid of Russian oil and gas. A full European Union ban on Russian crude oil and gas imports could have unintended economic consequences for the United States and its Western allies, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters in Washington on Thursday. She added that such a ban could do more harm than good.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, is diversifying its customer base. Rather than focusing on Europe to sell crude oil and gas, Russia is now making serious efforts to sell much larger volumes in Asia.\n\nChina has always been a major trading partner of Russia and continues to be so. India is another customer buying from Moscow in greater volumes. According to Reuters, it has bought nearly as much in the first months of 2022 as it did in the whole of 2021. And it is refraining from criticizing Russia for its Ukraine invasion.\n\nPakistan was also offered Russian crude at 30 per cent less than the market price. The previous government in Islamabad appeared keen. The United States was unhappy and some people in Pakistan now think the U.S. orchestrated a regime change there as a result.\n\nNew alliances are emerging.

Berkley said with 2.7 billion people unvaccinated around the world COVID-19 has ample space to mutate into new variants, including the recent Omicron strain, which is sickening triple-vaccinated people in the developed world.\n\n"Even though many countries with high coverage have now relaxed restrictions and reopened their societies, we are still in a state of global crisis," said Berkley. "So far, a new variant has emerged roughly every four to five months, and globally, nothing has changed to give us reason to believe that this pattern won\'t continue." Lily Caprani, the head of global health, vaccines and pandemic response for UNICEF, said it is in the "enlightened self-interest" of countries such as Canada to increase vaccination rates everywhere, otherwise there will be a continuing cycle of new variants emerging. Trans Mountain pipeline insurers dropping like flies "As we know, a new variant continues to emerge every four months or so and the threat is not over, either to those vulnerable populations, or to any country — even with high vaccine coverage," Caprani said.\n\nWhat\'s more, said Caprani, while COVID-19 might not have posed the greatest risk to children compared to other groups, the pandemic has caused them a generation\'s worth of harm in other ways. School closures, lack of access to maternal and newborn health care and a decline in immunizations of other preventable diseases has led to a re-emergence of measles and polio, she added. "Children are a kind of hidden victims of the pandemic," she said. New #variants will fuel COVID pandemic unless global vaccine rate rises: #Gavi, #UNICEF. #Covid19 #CDNPoli Caprani and Berkley told the committee that the problem of vaccine supply — which led to widespread criticism last year that Canada and other countries were vaccine hoarders — is no longer the prevailing problem. There are now plenty of manufactured vaccine doses available, but less-developed countries lack the capacity to actually get people vaccinated. They cited a range of factors from damaged or inadequate health-care systems to vaccine hesitancy, to a lack of health-care workers and basic supplies, such as syringes, to inject vaccines into willing arms. International Development Minister Harjit Sajjan noted the capacity shortcomings on a recent trip to western Africa and said he planned to look for ways to target Canada\'s aid spending to areas where it could be most useful.\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada was increasing its contribution to COVAX, the international vaccine sharing alliance that Gavi is leading, to $700 million to help purchase, deliver and distribute COVID-19 vaccines to lower-income countries. NDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson told the committee she did not want to see rich countries cut back on their overall international development spending as they roll out fourth doses for their own populations. "There\'s this sort of feeling that COVID-19 is over, that we can change the channel that we can turn the page. And I think both our witnesses today have made it very, very clear that we are not out of this pandemic."', 'image': 'https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/img/2022/04/26/9fa3c04317b45bc3d9a9229d2d587605423c6e795d4c2a4131bd78aad9b7ee0e.jpg_newsroom_base.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:18'}

(Mark Pathy)\n\nThe U.S. space agency furnished the launch site at its Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and assumed responsibility for the Axiom crew while they were aboard the space station. NASA\'s ISS crew members also pitched in to assist the private astronauts when needed.\n\nThe multinational Axiom team was led by Spanish-born retired NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria, 63, the company\'s vice president for business development. His second-in-command was Larry Connor, 72, a technology entrepreneur and aerobatics aviator from Ohio designated the mission pilot.\n\nCanadian joins historic private mission to the International Space Station Duration 2:03 Entrepreneur and philanthropist Mark Pathy is part of a four-person crew who made history Friday on board the first civilian mission to the International Space Station. The mission isn’t solely about space tourism — crew members plan to conduct several science experiments during their visit. 2:03\n\nJoining them as mission specialists were investor-philanthropist and former Israeli fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe, 64, and Canadian businessman and philanthropist Mark Pathy, 52.\n\n"This is really a dream come true," Pathy told CBC News on April 14, while in orbit. "Once we do have a chance to look out the window, it just is magical. It\'s just indescribable. The feeling you have looking out at Earth … and seeing the thin atmosphere around it and the complete darkness everywhere else, it\'s really mesmerizing."\n\nHere\'s part of my interview with Mark Pathy today for CBC News. <a href="https://twitter.com/Axiom_Space?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Axiom_Space</a> <a href="https://t.co/NErtYe5YtJ">pic.twitter.com/NErtYe5YtJ</a> —@NebulousNikki\n\nConnor, Stibbe and Pathy flew as customers of Axiom, which charges $50 million to $60 million USD per seat for such flights, according to Mo Islam, head of research for the investment firm Republic Capital, which holds stakes in both Axiom and SpaceX.\n\nLaunched on April 8, they spent 15 days aboard the space station with the seven regular, government-paid ISS crew members: three American astronauts, a German astronaut and three Russian cosmonauts.\n\nThe ISS has hosted several wealthy space tourists from time to time over the years.\n\nBut the Axiom quartet was the first all-commercial team ever welcomed to the space station as working astronauts, bringing with them 25 science and biomedical experiments to conduct in orbit. The package included research on brain health, cardiac stem cells, cancer and aging, as well as a technology demonstration to produce optics using the surface tension of fluids in microgravity.\n\nIt was the sixth human spaceflight for SpaceX in nearly two years, following four NASA astronaut missions to the ISS and the "Inspiration 4" flight in September that sent an all-private crew into Earth orbit for the first time, though not to the space station.\n\nSpaceX has been hired to fly three more Axiom astronaut missions to ISS over the next two years.', 'image': 'https://i.cbc.ca/1.6430293.1650912943!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/axiom-1-splashdown-mark-pathy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:07'}

More information is available at https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/about/partners.\n\nOn March 30, the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University hosted a conversation among Senior Research Scholars Dr. Mauricio Cardenas and Dr. Luisa Palacios, and Distinguished Visiting Fellow Juan Carlos Jobet, about the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine on Latin America’s energy sector. The discussion covered a range of issues, including the war’s influence on the region’s macroeconomic trends and energy transition. What follows are the main takeaways from the conversation:\n\nThe impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Latin America has to be seen from the point of view of the economic, political, and social consequences the war is creating. This event has already led to what has been called the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two. The war has also caused further disruption in already-strained supply chains and put more pressure on very tight global energy markets, Palacios said, given Russia’s key role in commodity markets. Russia is the world’s second largest crude exporter, after Saudi Arabia, the second largest petroleum product exporter, the largest natural gas exporter, and the third largest coal exporter. Russia is also a major producer of critical minerals and some agricultural commodities.\n\nPalacios said, given Russia’s key role in commodity markets. Russia is the world’s second largest crude exporter, after Saudi Arabia, the second largest petroleum product exporter, the largest natural gas exporter, and the third largest coal exporter. Russia is also a major producer of critical minerals and some agricultural commodities. The Russia-Ukraine war is leading to uneven and divergent macroeconomic trends in Latin America, Cardenas argued. The impact of the invasion on global commodity prices is putting pressure on inflation, not only because of the rise in energy prices but also because of the increase in agricultural prices, which is leading to food inflation. However, Latin American oil exporters, such as Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, stand to benefit from the point of view of their external accounts. The same can be said of large agricultural exporters, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, which are also seeing improvements in their terms of trade. The net food and fuel importers, mostly in Central America and the Caribbean, already vulnerable before this crisis, stand to lose the most. The region’s currencies have not yet been negatively impacted by the war. However, the risk premium has increased in some countries. Still, the foreign investment outlook remains a huge question mark in the context of rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe impact of the invasion on global commodity prices is putting pressure on inflation, not only because of the rise in energy prices but also because of the increase in agricultural prices, which is leading to food inflation.

Still, the foreign investment outlook remains a huge question mark in the context of rising geopolitical tensions. It is too soon to say whether the conflict will accelerate or delay the energy transition in the region, stated Jobet. On the one hand, the conflict highlights the need to increase supply from renewable energy, not only from an environmental point of view but also from an economic and energy security perspective—both in Latin America and worldwide. Also, high fuel prices make investments in renewable energy much more price competitive, which will help to increase and fund the supply of renewable energy. The Russia-Ukraine war and its impact on global energy prices are also making more evident the benefits of investments in energy efficiency (given the cost savings), which should help reduce demand for fossil fuels. On the other hand, this war also underscores that the world does need fossil fuels in the short term. This reality means that increasing investments in energy infrastructure to secure supplies could lock economies into fossil fuels for longer. The biggest challenge is how to navigate the current high prices and improve energy security while avoiding investments that may hurt the energy transition.\n\nOn the one hand, the conflict highlights the need to increase supply from renewable energy, not only from an environmental point of view but also from an economic and energy security perspective—both in Latin America and worldwide.

The biggest challenge is how to navigate the current high prices and improve energy security while avoiding investments that may hurt the energy transition. The speakers discussed how shielding consumers from fuel price increases could delay the energy transition. Cardenas argued that fuel pricing policy is a sensitive topic in Latin America, especially because of political events in the region, including upcoming elections in Colombia and Brazil, recent elections in Chile, and heightened political risks in Peru. Policy responses to the war and its impact on high energy prices have included subsidies and/or tax reductions on fossil fuels. Jobet cautioned that if these subsidies become permanent, they could delay the energy transition not only in Latin America but also in the rest of the world. This is why it is important to design fuel pricing policies that target the most vulnerable groups, Jobet suggested. Determining who pays the bill for these subsidies is also a key policy decision. Fiscal accounts and public debt in Latin America were already hard hit because of the pandemic, said Cardenas, who gave the example of Colombia, where fuel subsidies are expected to cost 2.5 percent of the country’s GDP this year. If governments use public resources to subsidize high energy prices, policy makers should have a clear understanding of how much subsidies cost, who benefits, and how long they will be in place.\n\nCardenas argued that fuel pricing policy is a sensitive topic in Latin America, especially because of political events in the region, including upcoming elections in Colombia and Brazil, recent elections in Chile, and heightened political risks in Peru.

If governments use public resources to subsidize high energy prices, policy makers should have a clear understanding of how much subsidies cost, who benefits, and how long they will be in place. Latin America will be negatively impacted by the increasing competition for US liquefied natural gas (LNG) coming from Europe’s drive to diversify away from Russian gas supply, Palacios argued. She noted that the region would need to increase gas production domestically for natural gas to be an affordable transition fuel in the context of increasing competition for LNG. Representing the bulk of electricity generated in the region, hydroelectricity has been the backbone and baseload of Latin America’s grid, but recurrent droughts due to climate change might be compromising this role, Palacios said. While non-hydro renewables have become the cheapest source of electricity at the moment, they remain an intermittent source of energy. This reality has pushed Latin American countries to rely on natural gas-fired power plants for the grid’s reliability. Latin America is both a producer and consumer of natural gas. Some Latin American countries have been increasing their LNG import capacity because domestic supply of natural gas has not been keeping up with rising demand. But, as indicated, LNG imports are becoming too costly. Palacios said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is occurring at a time of significantly widening price differentials between natural gas that is imported via pipelines, with pre-crisis Henry Hub prices around $5/MMbtu, and LNG spot prices of $30-35/MMbtu due to very tight global balances. The shift in European energy policy away from Russian piped natural gas and toward US LNG is making Latin America’s seasonal reliance on US LNG imports, which help the region cope with droughts, increasingly difficult. Cardenas said the situation illustrates how “Latin America is oil rich but gas poor.” Jobet presented a caveat to this discussion using Chile’s LNG supply contracts: most gas supplied to Chile is through Henry Hub-indexed LNG imports from the US and Trinidad and Tobago, which have capped the impact of high LNG prices on Chile’s energy markets. But this does not include the additional cargoes Chile has had to buy in the spot market, which faced those high prices. In the short term, Jobet argued, this dynamic may not be an issue because Europe has to build infrastructure to be able to import more LNG cargoes. But longer term, Europe’s LNG demand could be a source of concern if it causes a reduction in flows to Latin America. In Jobet’s view, this possibility underscores the case for green hydrogen as a substitute for natural gas, as Latin America is well positioned to be both a green hydrogen producer and exporter.\n\nPalacios argued. She noted that the region would need to increase gas production domestically for natural gas to be an affordable transition fuel in the context of increasing competition for LNG. Representing the bulk of electricity generated in the region, hydroelectricity has been the backbone and baseload of Latin America’s grid, but recurrent droughts due to climate change might be compromising this role, Palacios said. While non-hydro renewables have become the cheapest source of electricity at the moment, they remain an intermittent source of energy. This reality has pushed Latin American countries to rely on natural gas-fired power plants for the grid’s reliability. Latin America is both a producer and consumer of natural gas. Some Latin American countries have been increasing their LNG import capacity because domestic supply of natural gas has not been keeping up with rising demand. But, as indicated, LNG imports are becoming too costly. Palacios said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is occurring at a time of significantly widening price differentials between natural gas that is imported via pipelines, with pre-crisis Henry Hub prices around $5/MMbtu, and LNG spot prices of $30-35/MMbtu due to very tight global balances.

In Jobet’s view, this possibility underscores the case for green hydrogen as a substitute for natural gas, as Latin America is well positioned to be both a green hydrogen producer and exporter. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an opportunity for Latin American oil producers to position themselves as oil suppliers that are reliable and take environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns seriously, Palacios stated. On the question of whether Venezuela could offer an alternative to Russia’s oil, Palacios mentioned that Venezuela’s oil production was around 700,000–800,000 barrels per day (b/d) currently, according to OPEC, whereas global markets face the challenge of diversifying away from 7.8 million b/d of Russian oil, representing the total amount of crude and oil products exported by Russia as of December of 2021 according to the IEA.[1] At its peak, Venezuela was producing over 3 million b/d, but only 1.5 million b/d just before the oil sanctions began in 2019.[2] More relevant in the discussion about easing sanctions on Venezuela could be the redirection of Venezuelan oil, which currently trades through opaque means into Western markets. Echoing Palacios’s view of “ESG oil barrels,” or barrels of oil that come from ESG-minded oil suppliers, Cardenas argued that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might be changing the calculus of who produces. According to Cardenas, some studies suggest that Latin America was expected to be the region with the largest decline in oil production to comply with the world’s goal to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees, shifting from producing 10 million b/d in 2019 to 4 million b/d in 2035.3 But Cardenas said the Russian-Ukraine war is an opportunity for Latin American oil producers to position themselves as reliable suppliers.\n\nOn the question of whether Venezuela could offer an alternative to Russia’s oil, Palacios mentioned that Venezuela’s oil production was around 700,000–800,000 barrels per day (b/d) currently, according to OPEC, whereas global markets face the challenge of diversifying away from 7.8 million b/d of Russian oil, representing the total amount of crude and oil products exported by Russia as of December of 2021 according to the IEA.[1] At its peak, Venezuela was producing over 3 million b/d, but only 1.5 million b/d just before the oil sanctions began in 2019.[2] More relevant in the discussion about easing sanctions on Venezuela could be the redirection of Venezuelan oil, which currently trades through opaque means into Western markets.

Regarding the role of critical minerals, Jobet cautioned that the world cannot have an energy transition without mining: “We can stop mining or we can stop climate change, but not both at the same time.” Minerals such as copper, lithium, cobalt and others are essential for the energy transition. The speakers noted that key challenges for the mining sector include how to decarbonize their production of critical minerals and how to better communicate their essential role in the energy transition to the general public. If these challenges are not met, there is a risk that critical minerals could be a bottleneck in the energy transition, Jobet argued, referring to the uncertainty about the supply of these raw materials that are critical for renewable technologies. He stated that Chile is by far the largest copper producer in the world and that enormous amounts of investment are needed just to keep current volumes in production. He said that a new royalty (currently under discussion in Congress) or other changes in mining legislation being discussed by the constitutional convention could hurt investment in the sector if not properly designed. He said there is a lot of pressure from some governments, communities, and environmental groups to raise royalties, but a balanced discussion should consider both high spot prices and other risks inherent to mining, such as exploration and price volatility.\n\n“We can stop mining or we can stop climate change, but not both at the same time.” Minerals such as copper, lithium, cobalt and others are essential for the energy transition.

Not all fossil fuels will have the same fate in the energy transition—natural gas will likely be needed for longer. Jobet commented on the importance of distinguishing, especially to the general public, between the carbon intensity and emissions of coal, oil, and gas, as gas will likely remain in global energy systems for longer than the others. Palacios said that in Latin America, oil and gas companies have an important role to play in the energy transition, suggesting that natural gas in particular could be seen not only as a transition fuel but also as a “transition enabler” because it provides a backup for the grid, helping to manage the intermittency of renewable energy. Cardenas discussed the role of coal in the near term, noting that its price has doubled recently and that it is Colombia’s second largest export. Will these high coal prices help or damage the energy transition?\n\nJobet commented on the importance of distinguishing, especially to the general public, between the carbon intensity and emissions of coal, oil, and gas, as gas will likely remain in global energy systems for longer than the others.

She cited the lower costs of Brazil’s renewable power plants compared to its gas-based power plants as a lesson for Mexico. Palacios said there has not been a better time for promoting investment in renewable energy and implementing policies that favor the energy transition.\n\nShe cited the lower costs of Brazil’s renewable power plants compared to its gas-based power plants as a lesson for Mexico. Palacios said there has not been a better time for promoting investment in renewable energy and implementing policies that favor the energy transition. Many questions remained unanswered at the event because of limited time, but the variety of issues touched upon showcases the uncertainty ahead for Latin America due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Will the energy crisis in Europe eclipse or accelerate energy transition efforts in Latin America? Will advanced economies invest in Latin America’s oil and gas sectors as an alternative to other sources involved in the war? Could US-based EV makers export to Latin America at a time when EVs make more financial sense? Would higher prices negatively impact the ESG transition as funds are deployed in current energy subsidies? Energy security, regardless of price, will be based on fossil fuels for at least the next 10 years; should nuclear energy be included in the discussion about energy security? Are Latin American governments offering incentives for foreign direct investment (like exchange rate guarantees) in the energy sector that could become a fiscal risk in the long term? Is a government's tendency toward socialism or capitalism related to how it prioritizes the extraction of oil given the sustained increase of prices? What are the risks of diesel shortages in Latin America related to the Russia-Ukraine war? How would a victory by Gustavo Petro impact the Colombian oil industry and energy transition policies? How would high copper prices and leftist governments affect investment in this critical mineral for the energy transition? Can oil and gas produced with high ESG standards become a reality? Many serious questions must be answered in the years to come, and those will evolve as the Russian war in Ukraine continues to unfold.\n\nNotes", 'image': 'https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/all/themes/sipa/favicon.ico', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:08'}

Kerstine Appunn at Clean Energy Wire compiles information on the practical challenges for Germany’s oil infrastructure, refineries and security of supply. Germany is serviced by three pipeline systems for the west, the east and the south of the country. But they are not connected to each other so transport and logistical bottlenecks will need to be addressed to allow new imports to reach across the nation. Refineries will have to cope with a different kind of crude. Some refineries part-owned by Russia’s Rosneft will have to be made to comply. And German diesel refineries will struggle to meet demand. The government says if all Russian deliveries were to cease at short notice, Germany’s oil storage capacity and supply contracts should keep the country going for more than 200 days, leaving time to secure imports from other oil producers.\n\nRussian oil dependence\n\nRussia is the world’s third largest oil producer behind the United States and Saudi Arabia – it exports around 5 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude oil and 2.85 mb/d of other oil products. Around 750 kb/d are delivered to Europe via the Druzhba pipeline system.\n\nIn November 2021, Europe imported 3.1 mb/d of crude oil (34% of total imports) and 1.3 mb/d of other oil products from Russia. Germany is Europe’s (OECD) largest oil importer with 0.56 mb/d of crude oil and 0.090 mb/d of other mineral oil. Its average consumption in 2021 was 1.85 mb/d.\n\nWhat are the government’s plans to reduce oil imports from Russia?\n\nThe German government has announced that it will reduce oil imports from Russia by half until the middle of the year and achieve near-complete independence by the end of 2022. Many companies have already decided not to renew contracts with Russian producers and are replacing Russian imports with other suppliers, the economy and climate ministry said. “Changed supply chains will already take effect in the coming weeks and months,” said the ministry in April 2022.\n\nSupply chains and pipelines\n\nGermany is serviced by three pipeline systems for the west, the east and the south of the country. A pipeline from Italy services the south. Northern and western German refineries are connected to terminals in German and Dutch North Sea harbours. Eastern Germany receives its oil through the Russian Druzhba pipeline – the large refineries of Schwedt and Leuna are additionally connected to the harbours of Rostock and Gdansk. The Druzhba pipeline is operated by Russian company Transneft; around one third of Russian oil imports arrive by this route.\n\nThere are no connections between the pipeline systems of eastern and western Germany. Alternative oil supplies to the east will have to come via the Baltic Sea port of Rostock and Gdansk, as well as by road and railway, the economy ministry has said.\n\nExperts have said that bottlenecks in the supply chain are likely to occur simply because of the limited number of oil tankers landing in German harbours. The German government highlighted similar issues with the availability of trains and lorries to bring oil from the west to the east.\n\nOil refineries and local supply\n\nThere are 16 refineries in Germany that turn crude oil into fuels, such as heating oil, petrol, diesel and kerosene. In eastern Germany, the refineries of Schwedt and Leuna process up to 12 million tonnes of crude oil per year that come through the Druzhba pipeline. In the states of Berlin, Brandenburg, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, nine out of ten cars run on fuel from Schwedt, the company writes on its website. Leuna supplies around 1,300 filling stations in Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia, writes dpa.\n\n“However, an immediate embargo on Russian crude oil could lead to market distortions and bottlenecks in the supply of petroleum products regionally in eastern and central Germany, at least temporarily,” the economy and climate ministry warned.\n\nApart from ensuring that enough oil is delivered once supplies through the Druzhba pipeline dry up, the two refineries will also have to cope with a different kind of crude. At the moment they are specialised in the oil from certain sources in Siberia and converting refinery processes will require investment, Hendrik Mahlkow from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW) told dpa.\n\nFor the refinery in Leuna, operator TotalEnergies has announced that it would not enter into or renew contracts to purchase Russian oil, which, according to the company, means that Russian oil and petroleum products will end on 31 December 2022 at the latest.\n\nThe other large refinery in Schwedt, PCK, is partially owned by Russian company Rosneft. The capacity of the refinery is 11.6 million tonnes of crude per year, with Rosneft’s share in the capacity standing at 6.3 million tonnes per year, according to company information from November 2021. After previously holding 54 percent of the shares, it bought the stakes of Shell on 18 November 2021, increasing its ownership of the company to almost 92 percent. Only three days before the Russian attack on Ukraine, the Federal Cartel Office cleared the purchase. However, the federal economy and climate ministry a few days later announced that it would put the deal under review. In the so-called investment audit, it will check whether the foreign investment is expected to impair public order or security of the country.\n\nIn addition to the Schwedt PCK refinery, Rosneft also has a 24 percent stake in the MiRO refinery in Karlsruhe and a 28.57 percent stake in Bayernoil in Bavaria.\n\nThe German government also announced in the beginning of April 2022 that it could place Rosneft under fiduciary management or even expropriate them “if there is a concrete danger that without a fiduciary administration the company will not fulfil its tasks serving the functioning of the community in the energy sector and there is a threat of an impairment of the security of supply”. Gas supplier and storage operator Gazprom Germania is already under the control of the German authorities after they were discarded by the Russian parent company.\n\nHowever, as long as this is not the case for Rosneft’s PCK refinery, it is doubtful whether the company will take steps to reduce Russian oil deliveries.\n\nDiesel\n\nGermany and other European countries receive a lot of already refined diesel from Russia. Almost 15 percent of diesel sold in Germany is from Russian refineries.\n\nGerman refineries are already heavily geared to diesel production but still cannot meet the demand, researchers from the German Economic Institute (IW) said in March. As long as this is the case, diesel prices at the pump will remain high for German drivers.\n\nStorage and market flexibility\n\nGermany has a statutory oil reserve of around 15 million tonnes of crude oil and 9.5 tonnes of mineral oil products (e.g. petrol, diesel, heating oil, kerosene), which are distributed across Germany so that local supply bottlenecks can be addressed. If all Russian deliveries were to cease at short notice, the oil supply would be secure for more than 200 days (not considering transport issues and crude oil qualities), the government says.\n\nTo help stabilise prices on the world market, Germany and other members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) have released some of their oil reserves since the beginning of the war against Ukraine.\n\n“Depending on the market situation on the basically very flexible world market, substitutes could very probably be procured during this time for refineries that are supplied via seaports,” wrote the economy and climate ministry in an April 2022 evaluation. At the same time however, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has not shown any great desire to increase production to make up for the shortfall in Russian oil in Europe.\n\n***\n\nKerstine Appunn is a staff Correspondent for Clean Energy Wire\n\nThis article is published under a “Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (CC BY 4.0)”', 'image': 'https://energypost.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-practical-challenges-of-an-embargo-on-Russian-oil.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:37'}

Numbness. Dizziness. A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.”\n\nBiden, in his State of the Union address and his statement Monday, called on Congress to “pass bipartisan legislation to comprehensively address toxic exposures and further deliver the vital benefits our veterans have earned.”\n\nThe U.S. Senate unanimously approved a bipartisan bill from Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester and Kansas GOP Sen. Jerry Moran in mid-February that is the first of three pieces of legislation meant to address health care needs linked to burn pits.\n\nWhen announcing the $1 billion legislation in early February, Moran said that 3.5 million combat veterans have experienced some level of toxic exposure since 9/11.\n\n“This is the first step on a continuum of trying to make certain that those who experienced toxic exposure, and as a result are suffering in their health and well-being, receive medical benefits,” Moran said at the time.\n\nThe U.S. House voted 256-174 in early March to approve a separate bill that would be much larger in scope and price.\n\nThat legislation, referred to as the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics or PACT Act, would cost about $280 billion during the next decade.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said during floor debate the legislation would “expand veterans’ health care access and benefits to address the effects of these toxic exposures that occurred during their military service.”\n\n“We asked our veterans to go to battle for America, and they answered that call,” Hoyer said. “When they return home, veterans should not have to go to battle against red tape to receive the medical treatment and benefits they have earned through their service.”', 'image': 'http://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/veterans-affairs.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:28:17'}

However, is this strict control of information still possible, given that we live in an increasingly interconnected society where communication technologies can transmit information around the world in a matter of seconds? In this article, I look at how Syrian citizen journalists are employing communication technologies to disseminate coverage of the country’s civil war to global audiences. I find that by using mobile phones and the Internet, and with the help of activists living in the diaspora, they record and upload footage of the war’s atrocities, often undermining the Syrian government’s idealised version of events. Although the regime employs wide-ranging measures to track down and stop these individuals, they have become adept at concealing themselves online. The situation resembles a technological and dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, whereby citizen journalists attempt to remain one step ahead of their pursuers, enabling them to continue disseminating information pertaining to the conflict.\n\nIn order to effectively discuss such a phenomenon, this article will adhere to the following structure. I initially discuss the extent to which governments control information flow broadly, before outlining how Syrian citizen journalists challenge such control through their own use of communication technologies. Following this, I will then explore how the Syrian government attempts to counter such citizen journalism so to reassert their preferred war-related narrative, prior to some concluding remarks briefly examining how citizens have adapted to the state’s repressive measures.\n\nGovernment control of information\n\nWe have become accustomed to government attempts at both controlling and manipulating war reporting. Western states, particularly the US, have experimented with methods of ‘managing the media’ since the Vietnam War (Tumber and Palmer 2004, 2). In that conflict, the American media purportedly ‘lost the war’, as its coverage fuelled widespread ‘anti-war sentiment’ (Robinson et al. 2009, 678-88). This resulted in more sophisticated attempts to influence the media in subsequent conflicts.\n\nDuring the 1990-91 Gulf War, the US government authorised a multifaceted ‘press pool’ system, comprising of monitoring reporters’ movements and reviewing their reports (Kellner 1992, 80). Furthermore, in the subsequent Iraq War, the US government assimilated British and American correspondents into military units and essentially treated them as soldiers – a system which was termed ‘embedding’ (Allan and Zelizer 2004, 5). The official reasoning for this approach was to ‘facilitate maximum, in-depth coverage of US forces’,via the military enabling journalists to ‘get to the story alongside troops’ (US Secretary of Defense 2003). However, the government was also aware that embedding reporters restricted their ability to cover the war from alternative perspectives. Through being so absorbed into military operations, reporters became emotionally attached to the soldiers they were living alongside, and who they relied upon for protection. Chris Ayres, an embedded reporter for The Times of London, claimed he was ‘hardly objective: as a journalist embedded with a frontline artillery unit, my chances of avoiding death…were directly linked to the Marines’ ability to kill the enemy’ (Mangan 2003). Of course, embedding also prevented reporters from accessing other sources of information, as they were unable to roam across the country of their own accord – as had largely been the case during the Vietnam war. Correspondents were aware of the implicit motives behind the system. A Guardian reporter, Oliver Burkeman, regarded embedding as an ‘astounding PR success for the Pentagon’ (Burkeman 2003).\n\nSyrian citizen journalists\n\nHowever, the increasing ubiquity of communication technologies means governments no longer possess the same degree of control over war reporting, despite their varied efforts to manipulate the narrative. We can see this by looking at the ongoing Syrian civil war, where citizens rely on digital media to report the conflict. They can be termed ‘citizen journalists’, which refers to technologies enabling individuals beyond the mainstream media to produce and widely distribute information (Mitchell and Lim 2018, 402).\n\nTwo factors contribute to the war’s unmediated coverage being heavily reliant on the work of these individuals. The first is the government’s control of traditional media forms. The country’s 2001 Press Law is described by Human Rights Watch (HRW) as providing ‘the government with sweeping controls’ over domestic media, including newspapers, where it mobilises its own agenda (HRW 2010). The second factor is the war’s widespread desertion by foreign correspondents. Reporters Without Borders (RWB) claims the ‘risk of arrest, abduction and death’ makes journalism an extremely dangerous and difficult undertaking, with such dangers preventing news organisations from permitting conventional reporting (RWB 2022). The 2014 killing of two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, by the Islamic State, particularly revealed the perils of conducting traditional reporting (Baraniuk 2016). International media outlets increasingly rely upon coverage provided by freelance reporters, given that they are often a cheaper and less hazardous alternative to sending their own employees to a conflict zone (Lupick 2013). However, freelancers are especially vulnerable to surrounding risks. Freelancers typically have limited access to resources, such as protective equipment, and lack the necessary training to report safely from a scene of violence. It means the country is widely regarded as too dangerous even for them to report from (Gonzales 2014).\n\nConsequently, citizen journalists, in their utilisation of communication technologies, have increasingly responded to this lack of professional reporting (Klepke and Olsson 2014). It is the war’s otherwise absence of independent information, owing to the state’s traditional restrictions on freedom of expression, that convinces individuals to become citizen journalists. Hussein Akoush claims ‘the absence of objectivity’ provoked him to become ‘interested in journalism’ (D’Ignoti 2018). He regularly records and uploads video clips of the war’s devastation onto social media platforms. Malek Blacktoviche, who refers to himself as the ‘Syrian Developer’ on his Twitter page, was similarly inspired to become a citizen journalist by Syria’s traditional media being ‘so false’ (Tarboush 2022). As a result, he has dedicated himself to filming the conflict. For example, in 2012 he was involved in capturing and uploading a video from the Damascus suburb of Daraya, which documented a massacre by pro-government forces following the town’s recapture from rebels (Chou 2016). Foreign journalism-focused organisations have also supported citizen journalists in producing footage, besides relying on their accounts for their own news reports. The Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) is one of several organisations ‘training citizen journalists in Syria’ (Yousuf and Taylor 2017, 308). It does so by guiding citizen journalists to create and disseminate news stories, through facilitating collaboration with professional reporters.\n\nAnother motivation for this level of training is to enable citizens to avoid, and even counter, the levels of rumour, propaganda and misinformation instigated by pro-government forces, which are designed to substitute for accurate news. One example of this relates to an August 2013 Ghouta chemical attack. The Syrian government alleged that opposition groups were to blame, with President Assad using a CBS News interview to affirm the lack of evidence connecting the Syrian regime with the attack (CBS News 2013). However, HRW later concluded that government forces ‘were almost certainly responsible for the August 21 attacks’, as the weapons used could ‘only have been in the possession’ of the Syrian government (HRW 2013). This charge that was similarly expressed in a US government inquiry (US Government 2013). Both investigations advanced this conclusion after reviewing footage of the attack, uploaded onto Internet platforms by multiple citizen journalists, which helped identify the weapons.\n\nIt is not just Syrians living inside the country who are applying communication technologies to document the conflict. ‘Diaspora activists’ – a term first coined by Kari Anden-Papadopoulos and Mervi Pantti – are crucially important in facilitating the distribution of uncensored Syrian war reporting (Anden-Papadopoulos and Pantti 2013, 2186). Technologies allow Syrians living in the diaspora to act as brokers, by providing an intermediary role between citizen journalists and target audiences. Some commentators claim communication technologies aid the diaspora’s political influence within host countries and their country of origin or attachment. Indeed, in reference to this, the conflict scholar Mary Kaldor states that the ‘diaspora plays a much more important role than formerly because of the speed of communication’ (Kaldor 2012, 88).\n\nOne Syrian diaspora activist is Rami Abdul Rahman, who moved to Britain in 2000, and now operates the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (SOHR) online information service (Platt 2014). Rahman’s work is dependent upon ‘over 230 activists’, whose information allows him to compile war-related news reports, which are frequently cited by mainstream news outlets (MacFarquhar 2013). As with citizen journalists living within Syria, Rahman was persuaded to become an activist due to information otherwise being controlled by the state. In an interview with the New York Times, he claimed that ‘we have to document what is going on in Syria’, because official information merely attempts to ‘brainwash’ people into believing a distorted version of events (MacFarquhar 2013). Similarly, two diaspora activists residing in Turkey, Alisar Hasan and Feras Fayyad, established the Sout Raya radio station to circumvent the Syrian government’s control of information. Fayyad claims the station’s aim is to ‘distribute reports to the people inside Syria’, as they ‘need to know what is happening’ (Klepke and Olsson 2014).\n\nGovernment repression\n\nGiven the Syrian government’s authoritarian approach to freedom of expression, its response to the development of communication technologies is hardly surprising. Evidence suggests the state employs various tactics, including targeted online repression, in its endeavour to prevent a free flow of online information. The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) is largely responsible, given that it was created to facilitate a pro-government narrative to information coming out of Syria (Grohe 2015, 135). It effectively serves as the state’s de facto digital military service and actively targets political opponents. One activist, Tareq al-Jaza’eere, claims that it fights ‘an electronic war against the rebels’ (Harding and Arthur 2013). It does so by hacking citizens’ online communication, besides sending them threatening messages, in response to the circulation of anti-regime information (Mustafa 2016). The global reach of communication technologies means that citizen journalists living in the diaspora can also be targeted. This is attested by Mariam Hamou, a ‘media liaison’ activist living in Canada. In a 2016 interview with Open Canada, Hamou described how she was a victim of a ‘spear-phishing attack’. They are designed to target individuals by hacking personal email and social media accounts (Mustafa 2016).\n\nOnline repressive measures also help governments to physically locate dissenters, through surveilling their movements and locations (Anden-Papadopoulos and Pantti 2013, 2188). Individuals are aware that producing uncensored information involves a high degree of risk. In her interviews with Syrian diaspora activists, Dana Moss revealed how respondents fully acknowledge that online communication has the ‘potential to invite retribution for themselves and for their relatives’ (Moss 2016, 272). This assessment is endorsed by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). They state that citizen journalists ‘are regularly followed, arrested and tortured’, which it relates to the government’s sophisticated surveillance techniques (Galperin 2012). Alaa Nayef al-Khader al-Khalidi, a Syrian citizen photojournalist, was arrested by government forces whilst documenting conflict in the city of Douma. He subsequently died in government detention at the infamous Sednaya Military Prison, where he was allegedly tortured (CPJ 2019). Such cases indicate how communication technologies aid the Syrian government in physically intercepting citizen journalists.\n\nAdaptation\n\nGiven the varied measures of online (and offline) repression exerted by the Syrian government, the logical question to ask is ‘how do citizen journalists persist in using communication technologies to document information relating to the conflict?’ The answer, in large part, lies in Syrian citizens adapting to the state’s online repression, by exploiting innovative measures to overcome government surveillance (Bitar 2014, 236). They ensure there can be at least some evasion of the government’s repressive tactics. Meanwhile, naïve activists, who have not acquired the skills to conceal their communication, are at greatest risk.\n\nA 2014 report by Global Information Society Watch claims that citizen journalists have ‘become masters in the art of concealment’ (Bitar 2014, 238). One of the methods employed has been the adoption of pseudonyms. Malek Blacktoviche does so for his personal safety (Chou 2016). However, concealment methods are largely technological. One example is citizen journalists’ use of virtual private networks (VPNs). They help to conceal a user’s identity and hide their location online. They also ensure online communication is encrypted, thereby preventing governments from monitoring citizen journalists’ reporting (Clark 2018). Journalism-focused organisations, such as the IWPR, also aid citizen journalists in adapting to online repression. They provide guidance in how to avoid their digital communication being tracked and monitored (Sasseen 2012, 13), which is understandably regarded as essential training (Yousuf and Taylor 2017, 315). There is evidence of citizen journalists applying these skills. They have developed online coded language, whereby words or phrases that could reveal their location or intentions to government hackers are replaced with substitutes (Bitar 2014, 237). One citizen journalist, Samir Najjar, claims that ‘the weather is clear’ is coded language for there being no soldiers present (Mustafa 2016).\n\nOf course, such adaptive measures do not guarantee the permanent safety of citizen journalists, nor prevent every case of online repression. If individuals are in the wrong place at the wrong time, there is not much they can do. The CPJ reports that over 130 journalists have been killed since the onset of the civil war, many of them citizen journalists (CPJ 2022). Furthermore, although the adaptive measures undoubtedly aid citizen journalists in their reporting in the short term, evidence suggests their efficacy is not permanent. This is owing to the inevitability of states’ sophisticated online tools overcoming these methods of concealment. The SEA is responding to the use of VPNs by targeting individual internet users with ‘malware’ – a software designed to disrupt and gain unauthorised access to a computer system. It bypasses security systems, including VPNs, thereby allowing online monitoring to continue (Clark 2018). Unless individuals quickly respond, by downloading an alternative VPN or security system, then their safety is in jeopardy as are other methods of concealment, such as the application of coded language. Therefore, the whole situation reflects a cat-and-mouse game – unless citizen journalists can continue evading the state’s sophisticated online tools of repression, they will inevitably get caught-out and be forced to end their unmediated reporting of the country’s ongoing war.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough governments seek to control and manipulate war reporting, the increasing ubiquity of communication technologies clearly creates a new set of challenges, even in countries where the traditional media ecology consists of strict governmental control of information and freedom of expression. By focusing on the role of citizen journalists in the Syria, I found that the application of communication technologies enables them to provide valuable coverage of the conflict’s ongoing atrocities. The state’s attempts to intercept and repress this flow of information, through a variety of online techniques, means that citizens must realistically employ sophisticated methods of concealment if they are to continue their reporting. While this does not guarantee permanent security, as evidenced by the numbers of journalists killed and imprisoned, and the ways in which the state attempts to overcome adaptive measures, it nonetheless means the outside world continues to benefit from this uncensored information distributed by determined individuals. There is no reason to believe this cat-and-mouse game will cease anytime soon.\n\nReferences\n\nAllan, Stuart and Barbie Zelizer. 2004. ‘‘Rules of engagement: journalism and war’’.

The Shia political party and militant group likes to keep tight control on information coming out of its strongholds, she told CPJ. “Hezbollah doesn’t like coverage in Beirut’s southern district without its approval.”\n\nEddine’s story, which was published in Lebanese newspaper Nidaa al-Watan, detailed the family’s fears of impunity in the teenager’s death and the political pressures that often play a role in covering up crimes in the area. The story went viral, she said, and online commentators began to accuse her of “treachery” against Hezbollah and the Shia political party Amal, even though she didn’t name them in the piece.\n\nSoon, the accusations escalated into assaults on her family, and in 2021 Eddine and her parents, sister, and two brothers decided to flee to France. Since then, Eddine has continued reporting in exile about Lebanon for investigative journalism website Daraj.\n\nIn an interview with CPJ, Eddine went into detail about the family’s decision to leave and explained why Lebanese journalists face increasing threats. Lebanon is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on May 15 amid political and economic instability after the 2019 protests and the 2020 Beirut port explosion.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou started to receive serious threats after you reported on the teenager killed in your neighborhood. When did the threats turn into assaults?\n\nMariam Seif Eddine: On November 2, 2020, my older brother was pushed on the ground, he was bitten in the eye. This attack was launched by members of our family affiliated with Hezbollah. They told us to leave our home “or you will be killed.” Other people linked with Hezbollah then continued the threats.\n\nThen on December 5, 2020, a group of men, some carrying weapons, attacked our home and assaulted my family members; my younger brother was punched in the face, his nose was broken. All of this was fueled by an incitement campaign which included accusations that we were agents for Israel, and that we had committed treachery and slander.\n\nWhen we tried to report these attacks, the security forces didn’t take us seriously, violating our rights. Even then [after the December attack], they treated us as if we were the attackers, not the plaintiffs. The judge didn’t take our complaints seriously, as she told me “you can go home” even when I told her we were forced out, attacked.\n\n[Editor’s note: Reached by CPJ, Hezbollah media liaison Rana Sahili said that the violence against Eddine’s family was caused by a “family dispute,” and not Eddine’s journalism. She said Hezbollah played no role in the dispute. A senior officer in the Lebanese Internal Security Forces media office told CPJ that the security forces had conducted investigations into the attacks but did not provide further details.]\n\nYou said the physical attacks were prefaced by an online campaign against you. Are online campaigns like these, in particular against female journalists, common in Lebanon?\n\nThese campaigns take the form of hate speech, spreading misinformation, [accusations of] treachery, and are in fact, a moral assassination. They aim to silence women journalists by fueling the misogynistic society already against them, and some fake accounts even try to slut shame you. If that doesn’t get to you, they distort your reporting by making posts mischaracterizing your work and opinions to make you seem like an extremist.\n\nSome journalists unfortunately participate in these kinds of campaigns. They try to terrorize other journalists by making them feel they’re under constant monitoring.\n\nEvery word used in such campaigns aim to destroy the mental health of women journalists. Threats against women journalists are often linked to the society’s way of approaching them in the first place. When a man says what I say, he’s not threatened the same way. Political parties are more threatened when women speak up because it’s often women who challenge society’s “sacred” topics.\n\nI tried to ignore most of these comments but some of them contained rape threats, vulgar misogynistic slurs, and death threats. Even after I left the country, these violent online campaigns against me continued in an aim to silence me or push me to self-censor my articles and posts.\n\nEvery social media platform has its own regulations, and on Twitter, some violence and orchestrated campaigns through fake accounts is allowed. These regulations often favor powerful violent people over journalists and activists – when they try to report abusive behavior it leads to nothing.\n\n[Editor’s note: Reached by CPJ, a Twitter spokesperson said via email the company has made “recent strides” to protect people online but acknowledged there is “still work to be done.”]\n\nHow would you characterize the state of press freedom in Lebanon?\n\nPress freedom in Lebanon is deteriorating. We’re now allowed to speak only within limits.\n\nWhen there was rising political tension in the country [with multiple parties vying for power] the margin of freedom was bigger, as freedom spiked after Syrian troops left Lebanon in 2005 after a 29-year occupation. But when one party dominates the scene as President Michel Aoun’s Free Patriotic Movement has done since his election 2016, we see how freedom of expression and freedom of the press have taken a fall [since one party can more easily dictate coverage]. Also the funding a news outlet gets plays a role in the margin of freedom [as some politicians fund or own news outlets].\n\nBut the alternative media in the country is pushing back against this. These relatively new outlets allow journalists to report on “taboos” and “red lines,” and publish a new narrative not accepted in other media outlets which are funded by powerful actors inside the country.\n\nAre journalists legally protected in Lebanon?\n\nIn Lebanon, there are laws that govern media and publishing, but there’s no law that aims at protecting the safety of journalists, which is a must. There must be a law that protects journalists against threats they face because of doing their jobs.\n\nLaws in the country are used against weaker people who aren’t backed by powerful actors and parties. The judiciary acts on defamation lawsuits but complaints about death threats to journalists “sleep in drawers” [filed away and never revisited by officials], which essentially means laws are used against us and never to allow us to defend ourselves.\n\nAfter everything you have faced, why are you still practicing journalism in exile?\n\nIf we stop writing, they win. After fleeing the country, I feel more responsible for documenting what’s happening in people’s lives, especially to raise the voice of those who were forced into silence.\n\nEditor’s note: The order of of events in the assaults against Eddine’s brothers has been corrected in the seventh and eighth paragraphs.', 'image': 'https://cpj.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/-سيف-الدين-e1650987761848.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:26:44'}

A once-dominant military machine, first humbled in its agonizing standoff in Viet Nam, now looked incapable of keeping its aircraft aloft even when no enemy knew they were there, and even incapable of keeping them from crashing into each other despite four months of practice for their mission,” read the Time cover story dubbed, Debacle in the Deseret”.\n\n\n\n“It was the Tabas fiasco which led to Carter’s failure in the second round of the US presidential elections from Iran’s newly-born Islamic Revolution,” said the spokesman.\n\n\n\nHe added that one of the reasons for the US' repeated failures from Iranians and its miscalculations is that the Islamic community is protected by God. “One of the most recent examples of the Iranians’ victory is the failure of the [the US unilaterally imposed] sanctions.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, the US launched what it called a maximum pressure campaign against Iran, under former president Donald Trump’s administration after Trump abandoned a historic nuclear deal called the Joint Comprehensive Nuclear Action (JCPOA) which was signed in 2015 between Iran and world six powers (US, Russia, UK, France, China and Germany). The maximum pressure campaign targeted the Iranian nation with the “toughest ever” restrictive measures.\n\n\n\n“The Americans have repeatedly said that Iran’s society will collapse from within under the unprecedented sanctions. Even in their joint meetings with the [terrorist] Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO), they had also planned to conquer Tehran. On the contrary, the sanctions are now in a phase that even the Western powers admitted that they have been abortive,” Jahromi said in his article.\n\n\n\nHe further recalled a statement by Ned Price, spokesman for the US Department of State, who had once said the maximum pressure policy was a fiasco.\n\n\n\nNoting that the US and other ill-wishers of the Iranian nation have for many years been accustomed to being defeated by Iran, the government spokesman concluded by saying, “But it seems that they are not to learn their lesson.”\n\n\n\n............................\n\nEnd/ 257", 'image': 'https://en.abna24.com/upload/image/2022/04/26/f3ccdd27d2000e3f9255a7e3e2c48800_128.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:27:38'}

Saab is the director of the defense and security program at the Middle East Institute.\nHe’s also the author of the forthcoming book Rebuilding Arab Defense: U.S. Security Cooperation in the Middle East.', 'channel': 'defenseone.com', 'text': 'In September 2021, a year after the Abraham Accords were signed by Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates (Morocco and Sudan joined a few weeks later), U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken spoke enthusiastically of Arab-Israeli collaborations already under way in various domains including energy, health care, technology, medicine, and tourism.\n\nOn the potential security benefits of these historic normalization deals, however, he was almost mum. Arab and Israeli leaders who participated in the call with Blinken were tight-lipped, too. They were eager to emphasize the political and economic opportunities of the accords but careful to limit any talk of military cooperation to vague notions of peace and stability.\n\nNo one should be surprised that the Americans, and particularly the Arabs and the Israelis, wish to highlight the economic promise of the accords more than anything else. Unlocking the economic potential of bilateral ties was and still is the chief motivation and focus of the Bahrainis, the Emiratis, and the Israelis. Security was not the driver of normalizing ties with Israel.\n\nOutside official Arab and Israeli circles, commentary on the security aspects of the accords has swung from one extreme to another. The strongest believers hailed the accords as a monumental breakthrough that will usher a new era of peaceful relations in the Middle East. The staunchest critics argued that by banding together against Iran—their mutual adversary—the Gulf Arabs and the Israelis might instigate a regional war or at least cause further tensions in the region.\n\nNeither forecast is compelling. Yet given the strategic significance of the accords, it’s important to have a better understanding of their security implications, not only for the signatories but also for the whole region.\n\nLet’s start with what has happened already in the area of security cooperation, at least publicly. In November 2021, Bahraini and Emirati navies held their first-ever joint military exercise in the Red Sea with Israeli warships, coordinated by the U.S. Fifth Fleet, which is based in Manama. More collective policing activity at sea is expected to follow in the coming months to counter weapons smuggling and other threats posed by terrorists, pirates and the Iranian navy.\n\nAlso expected in the not-too-distant future is air and missile defense cooperation between the Gulf Arabs and the Israelis. Both sides fear Iran’s increasingly precise missiles and armed drones; together, they are likely to explore avenues to create a more effective shield against those deadly weapons. Israel’s recent tests of what it called “the world’s first energy-based” defense against drones and other short-range weapons are no doubt of interest to the Gulf Arabs, especially the Saudis and the Emiratis, who have struggled to ward off Houthi and Iranian attacks.\n\nBut aside from maritime security and air and missile defense and possibly cyber security, it’s hard to see how the Gulf Arabs and the Israelis will pursue other forms of security cooperation. That’s largely because the Gulf Arabs and the Israelis have dissimilar strategic priorities and approaches in terms of how to deal with the Iranian challenge.\n\nFirst, although Abu Dhabi and Manama, like Tel Aviv (and Washington), perceive Iran as the key menace to the region, the two sides have dissimilar strategic objectives and approaches in terms of how to deal with this challenge.\n\nIsrael prioritizes Iran’s nuclear program, which Tel Aviv views as an existential threat. It certainly worries about Iran’s proxies and missiles, too, but an atomic weapon in the hands of a radical regime that doesn’t even recognize the Jewish state is the absolute nightmare scenario the Israelis are doing everything they can to prevent.\n\nThe Gulf Arabs, meanwhile, prioritize Iran’s political violence across the region more than anything else. While they have concerns about Tehran acquiring nukes, they understand there’s nothing they can do to stop Iran from getting them. And they believe it’s a problem for the United States and the rest of the world to solve.\n\nTo address Iran’s expanding influence and military infrastructure in places like Iraq and Syria, Israel often resorts to kinetic operations. Over the past six years or so, the Israeli military has conducted more than 400 airstrikes against Iranian targets in the region, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. This use of force, the Israelis believe, is not only effective but necessary in the fight against the regional Iranian threat.\n\nThe Gulf Arabs are keen to deal with Iran’s aggressive foreign policy exclusively through defense and diplomacy. They fear the repercussions of escalation with Iran should they respond militarily to attacks against them, especially at a time when their faith in U.S. protection is lower than ever. Israel, however, has fewer qualms about escalation with Iran because it believes that its considerable military edge (and its willingness to use it in combat, which it has demonstrated repeatedly) serves as a deterrent against things spiraling out of control.\n\nIt is this Israeli ability and willingness to hurt the Iranians whenever they cause mischief that interests but also alarms the Gulf Arabs. If they get too close to Israel and start to establish more expansive and meaningful forms of security cooperation—for example, providing it with more sensitive intelligence and military access—the Iranians might lash out at them.\n\nAbu Dhabi and Manama would be guilty by association, which is precisely what happened to Riyadh in September 2019 when Tehran launched strikes against it with drones and cruise missiles not because of anything the Saudis did but because of their support of the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against the Iranian regime.\n\nThe Gulf Arabs are the more vulnerable party in this newfound friendship with Israel and they know they risk getting attacked by Iran, perhaps more viciously this time, if they decide to upgrade their security cooperation with the Israelis.\n\nBut they also can’t completely ignore the practical benefits of stronger defense ties with Israel given the shared interests and threat perceptions and importantly, the reduced security commitment of Washington to the region, hence the dilemma they have on their hands.\n\nThe security relationship with Israel can be a burden for the Gulf Arabs if the former, rightly or wrongly, ratchets up the pressure militarily against Iran (which is a distinct possibility if the United States reaches a new nuclear deal with Iran that provides it with billions of dollars in frozen funds and thus to capacity to sow greater mayhem in the region).\n\nYet it can also serve as insurance against more reckless behavior by the Iranians. So, Tehran gets a vote. The more threatening, coercive, and intimidating its posture toward its Gulf Arab neighbors, the more eager they will be to form a closer military bond with Israel.\n\nBilal Y.

According to New York Post, Mr Saab, a US citizen since 2008, was arrested by the feds in 2019 and charged with several counts, including terrorism, for allegedly providing materials to the terrorist group.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Saab faced trial in one of the many New York City buildings he has been accused of plotting to bomb. As per the Post, the former sleeper agent for Hezbollah allegedly moved to the United States in 2000 from Lebanon with a secret mission to apply for citizenship and plan a future attack on behalf of the militant group designated a foreign terrorist organisation.\n\nIn his opening statement, Assistant US Attorney Sam Adelsberg noted that the 45-year-old kept up appearances as a “normal” law-abiding US citizen, while also gathering intelligence on a number of tunnels and bridges. “He posed as a regular guy,” Mr Adelsberg said, adding, “In reality, he was a sleeper agent for Hezbollah ready to strike.”\n\nAlso Read | Osama Bin Laden "Miscalculated" US\' Response To 9/11 Attacks, Show Navy SEAL Documents: Report\n\nAccording to New York Daily News, the attorney further went on to say that Mr Saab, instead of doing his day job, surveyed the lower Manhattan courthouse, the FBI offices at 26 Federal Plaza, the Empire State Building and Kennedy Airport. The 45-year-old\'s ultimate goal, according to the report, was to scope out targets so the Islamic network “could kill Americans if Americans threatened Iran, Hezbollah\'s main ally”.\n\nThe prosecutor said that Mr Saab also surveyed building in Boston, Washington DC, and other cities abroad. He even tried to murder an Israeli spy in the 1990s, Daily News reported. As per the Mr Adelsberg\'s statement, Mr Saab even allegedly gathered ‘“details like, how buildings were constructed. How close one could get to a building to plant a bomb as part of an attack. And whether these buildings or landmarks had weaknesses or soft spots Hezbollah could exploit”.\n\n“This was information that Hezbollah would use to calculate the size of a bomb needed to attack a particular target - information for determining the ideal location to place that bomb to maximize death and destruction,” the prosecutor claimed.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Saab\'s lawyer Marlon Kirton, according to the Daily News report, said that his client had long cut ties with the Islamic militant group.

Picture taken March 12, 2020. REUTERS/Satish Kumar\n\nBENGALURU, April 26 (Reuters) - The Gulf Cooperation Council\'s (GCC) economic growth will accelerate this year to a pace not seen in a decade, according to a Reuters poll of economists, who said high inflation and a slowing global economy were the biggest downside risks.\n\nCrude prices, a major driver for Gulf economies, shot up after Russia invaded Ukraine in February and have remained elevated, giving a major boost to economies in the oil and gas-rich region. read more\n\nAn April 12-22 Reuters poll predicted growth overall in the six GCC economies would average 5.9% this year, which would be the fastest since 2012.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n"GCC economies have seen a relatively strong start to 2022. The hydrocarbons sectors have benefited from increased oil production so far this year, with crude oil production up 12% on Q1 2021 for the UAE and 19% over the same period for Saudi Arabia," said Khtija Haque, chief economist at Emirates NBD.\n\n"Survey data for the first quarter of the year point to a solid expansion in non-oil sectors as well, with strong growth in business activity and new work in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar."\n\nFor Saudi Arabia, the region\'s largest economy and world-leading exporter of crude oil, about 80% - or 17 of 22 contributors - upgraded their forecasts from the previous poll in January.\n\nIt was expected to grow 6.3% in 2022, up from the 5.7% forecast three months ago, before slowing to 3.2% growth next year. If that happens, 2022 growth would be the fastest since 2011, when oil averaged around $111 per barrel.\n\nThe expected growth in Kuwait at 6.4%, and in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at 5.6%, would be the fastest in around a decade. Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain are expected to grow around 4%, the fastest in several years.\n\nHowever, when asked for the top two downside risks to GCC economies this year, 10 of 12 economists who answered an additional question said high inflation and a slowdown in the global economy.\n\nInflation in most of the GCC economies has risen in recent months against the backdrop of high food prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nAlthough modest in comparison to many other countries, GCC inflation is expected to rise above 2% this year, with the highest median forecast for Qatar at 3.5%, and the lowest for Saudi Arabia at 2.5%.\n\n"In the face of higher commodity and global food prices, we have revised our 2022 inflation forecast for the GCC region to be about 3.5% from around 2.5%," noted Ilker Domac, regional head of economics at Citi.\n\n"Since GCC countries import 85% of their food, a sustained upward pressure on international food prices could pose a challenge for policymakers in the region."\n\nAlso, uncertainty caused by the conflict in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on a global economy just emerging from the ravages of the pandemic.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund last week slashed its 2022 global growth forecast, citing war impact and describing inflation as a "clear and present danger". read more\n\nThe GCC, highly dependent on revenues from energy exports, would face weaker demand from an economic slowdown - especially in China, one of the world\'s biggest oil and gas importers.\n\n"From the regional perspective, global growth concerns become a worry if they hit oil prices. Price pressures are certainly being felt though on the assumption inflation eases into 2023, the present trends should not derail efforts to keep non-oil sector recoveries on track", said Maya Senussi, senior economist at Oxford Economics.\n\n(For other stories from the Reuters global long-term economic outlook polls package:)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting and polling by Md Manzer Hussain Editing by Hari Kishan, Jonathan Cable and Mark Potter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.', 'image': 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/NviriSUzSUmTRWrcAv6Eal0AFgw=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/WIWYQCIR2NK6PEDHVLFD6H6MBI.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:26:46'}

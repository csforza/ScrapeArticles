Poland and Bulgaria would be the first countries to have their gas cut off by Europe\'s main supplier since Russia started what it calls a military operation in Ukraine on February 24. The move to cut off supplies also followed sanctions imposed by Poland against Russian individuals and companies. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that countries he terms "unfriendly" agree to a scheme under which they would open accounts at Gazprombank and make payments for Russian gas imports in euros or US dollars that would be converted into roubles. Poland is a staunch political opponent of Russia. Polish gas company PGNiG, whose gas deal with Russia expires at the end of this year, has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract. It also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland. Poland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year, and covers about 50 per cent of national consumption. Earlier, data from the European Union network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted but they resumed later on Tuesday. Poland\'s energy supplies were secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said on Tuesday, adding there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut. Gazprom also informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it would halt gas supplies from Wednesday, the energy ministry said. Bulgaria also had a contract due to expire at the end of the year. It meets more than 90 per cent of its gas needs with Gazprom\'s imports about 3 bcm a year. Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at data intelligence firm ICIS, said: "This is a seismic warning shot by Russia." "Poland has had an anti-Russia and anti-Gazprom stance for a number of years, which is not the case for Bulgaria, so to see Bulgaria also be cut off is also quite a development in its own right," he said.

Poland and Romania are the first to ask for it.\n\nJames Heappey, UK\'s Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces, told Times Radio that Ukraine had a legal right to strike military facilities on the Russian territory to disrupt the logistics of the Russian Armed Forces.\n\nIt is “completely legitimate for Ukraine to be targeting in Russia’s depth in order to disrupt the logistics that if they weren’t disrupted would directly contribute to death and carnage on Ukrainian soil," Heappey said.\n\nCommenting on this statement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that in order to disrupt military logistics, Russia could strike military targets on the territory of a number of NATO countries that supply arms to the Kiev regime.\n\n"Do we have the right understanding here? After all, it directly leads to deaths and bloodshed on Ukrainian territory. As far as I understand, Britain is one of those countries," Zakharova clarified in her Telegram channel.\n\nEvery time when they sell weapons to Ukraine, European countries fear that they will become a party to military action and "Putin\'s wrath". The head of the German Foreign Office, Annalena Baerbock, expressed her concerns on he matter.\n\n"We at the government are united in saying that we will not become a party to the conflict," she said during a press conference on April 20.\n\nHungary shares a different point of view. Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said during a visit to Kosovo that Hungary had no plans to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine. In addition, Hungary does not allow their transit to Kiev, as they "could become targets to hostile military actions".\n\n"We are not getting involved in this war," the minister explained.\n\nIncidentally, a group of German public figures wrote an open letter to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz calling for arms shipments to Ukraine to end, as this "drags Germany into war".\n\n"By supplying weapons, Germany and other NATO countries have de facto made themselves a party to the war. Ukraine has thus become a battleground in a conflict between NATO and Russia over security rules in Europe that has been escalating for years," the letter claims.\n\nPrimary targets for Caliber missiles\n\nActive suppliers of lethal weapons to Nazi Kiev regime are:\n\nCzech Republic,\n\nPoland,\n\nSlovenia,\n\nTurkey,\n\nGermany,\n\nUSA.\n\nMany do so unofficially, e.g. Bulgaria.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that negotiations on Ukraine were unlikely to be effective if Kiev continues to receive arms shipments from other countries. In the United States, CNN sources describe arms supplies to Ukraine as an investment in neutralising Russia\'s army and navy for a decade to come. Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin\'s recent statements about his intention to "weaken Russia" through military aid to Ukraine are a cynical reminder of NATO being an aggressive organisation that targets Russia in the first place.\n\nWhere can Russia strike western logistics and military facilities?\n\nThis could be Romania in the first place. Romania may now invade Transnistria to save its Moldovan brothers there.\n\nPoland is next on the list - this country serves as a transit point for all arms shipments from Western countries to Ukraine.\n\nThese countries will not survive a Caliber missile attack either physically or mentally.

It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense. Speaking at the event, Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense, told reporters that "we have to move at the speed of war."\n\nAustin said the US was determined to make better use of the US European Command\'s coordination mechanism and would extend the forum for Ukraine\'s defense into a monthly contact group.\n\n"We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and make it less able to do that," Austin said.\n\nAustin went on to express sharp criticism of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who warned on Monday that World War III might be looming.\n\n"You\'ve heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful," Austin said. "Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence. The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing. Mantoo added that Syria has the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled the country.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nUN doubles Ukraine aid appeal to $2.25 billion\n\nThe United Nations\' humanitarian agency (UN OCHA) said that it has been forced to double its aid appeal to $2.25 billion (€2.11 billion) as the humanitarian situation in the country worsens.\n\n"Over $2.25 billion is now required for needs inside Ukraine, more than double of the amount requested ($1.1 billion) when we launched the appeal on 1 March, a few days after the war began," the UN OCHA said in a statement.\n\nUS, allies will \'move heaven and Earth\' to meet Ukrainian security requirements — Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the aim of the conference at the air base in Ramstein, Germany was to "help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion," as well as to "build up Ukraine\'s defenses for tomorrow\'s challenges."\n\nAustin said that he discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Kyiv\'s "changing requirements" as Russia focuses on Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region. Austin said that the US and its allies will "keep moving heaven and Earth" to meet Ukraine\'s security requirements.\n\n"Ukraine needs our help to win today, and they will still need our help when the war is over," Austin said. He added that the US and its allies have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine\'s defense since the start of the war.\n\nThe defense secretary said that Ukraine "has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia\'s unprovoked invasion."\n\nAustin said that Ukraine\'s allies had provided assistance at "record speed," adding that "Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly."\n\nReferring to Russian troop withdrawal from areas around Ukraine\'s capital, Austin said that the war was "entering a new phase" following what he called "Russia\'s defeat at the battle of Kyiv."\n\n"Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man," Austin said, alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The interior ministry of the region said those antennas were re-broadcasting Russian radio.\n\nThe incident occurred in a small town of Maiac about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the regional capital Tiraspol and roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said.\n\nThe explosions come just a day after several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the state security ministry in Tiraspol.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu is convening a meeting of the country\'s Supreme Security Council on Tuesday over incidents that took place in Trans-Dniester.\n\nTrans-Dniester is a narrow strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River, sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova. The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government has come under increasing pressure over not yet sending heavy weapons to Ukraine.\n\nUS kicks off Ukraine conference at Ramstein air base\n\nA defense conference on securing Ukraine\'s long-term security is now underway at the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has invited around 40 countries to the conference. While many NATO members will be present, a number of the countries invited are not NATO member states.\n\nThe attendees will include NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht.\n\nThe meeting seeks to boost weapons deliveries to Ukraine and bolster the country\'s long-term security.\n\nAustin and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday and pledged additional military assistance to Kyiv. Austin and Blinken are expected to brief allies on Ukraine\'s security needs during the conference.\n\nWatch video 02:05 US to host talks on assistance for Ukraine in Germany\n\nNo imminent threat of direct confrontation with Russia — UK armed forces minister\n\nBritish Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said he did not think there was an imminent threat of escalation in the war in Ukraine leading to nuclear conflict.\n\n"What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine. German defense company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann will be given the green light to sell "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks from previous Bundeswehr stocks, dpa reported.\n\nGermany\'s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported that Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht will pledge the anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine during today\'s meeting at the Ramstein US air base.\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Monday following a meeting with Ukrainian officials that Kyiv had requested tanks as it seeks to adapt to the shifting conditions of the conflict.\n\nGermany is reportedly to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft "Gepard" tanks\n\nKreminna in Luhansk region has fallen — UK defense ministry\n\nBritain\'s Defense Ministry said in a Tuesday intelligence update that the town of Kreminna in Ukraine\'s eastern Luhansk region has reportedly fallen to Russian forces.\n\nRussian troops are attempting to advance north to Sloviansk and east to Kramatorsk, according to the ministry.\n\n"Russian forces are likely attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the east of Ukraine," the intelligence update said, adding that Ukrainian forces have been preparing defenses in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nUK drops import tariffs on goods from Ukraine to zero\n\nThe UK has dropped tariffs on all goods coming from Ukraine, following a direct request from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"The UK will continue to do everything in its power to support Ukraine\'s fight against Putin\'s brutal and unprovoked invasion," British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said.\n\nThe average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22%.\n\nThe British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods.\n\nUkraine wants UN to seek Mariupol evacuation\n\nUkraine has urged UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol. Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes. Russia\'s Defense Ministry claimed it used missiles to destroy facilities powering the railways supplying Ukrainian forces with foreign weapons.\n\nAbout 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. Ukraine has claimed 22,000 Russian troops were killed since the invasion. Russia has acknowledged only 1,351 military deaths.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalize parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims.\n\nAfter a visit to Kyiv, Blinken said Russia\'s military was underperforming, and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nWatch video 02:54 Russian missiles strike Ukrainian rail stations\n\nYou can revisit our live updates from April 25 here.\n\nsi, lo, aw/wmr, rs, mhm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61602081_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:19'}

Russia is also proving that energy resources are a weapon. That is why the EU needs to be united and impose an embargo on energy resources, depriving the Russians of their energy weapons.”\n\nThe move will be a grave concern to those countries who are the most heavily dependent on Russian gas, such as Germany, but at a hastily arranged press conference, Polish ministers said they had sufficient supplies to weather an interruption while accusing Gazprom of a breach of contract.\n\nAnna Moskwa, Poland’s minister for climate, said: “There are no worries about shortages of gas in our homes. It is worth pointing out that liquified natural gas alone supplies the market sufficiently. LNG deliveries in [terminal] Świnoujście are growing – in 2015 there was one, in 2021 it was already 35. As of today, it provides for about 50 deliveries.”\n\nShe added: “Appropriate diversification strategies that we have introduced allow us to feel on the safe side in this situation.”\n\nPGNiG, Poland’s largest gas supplier, said it would file a breach of contract lawsuit over Gazprom’s decision.\n\nRussia currently supplies about 55% of Poland’s annual demand of about 21bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas but the country’s government has still been pushing the EU and other western allies to go further in punishing the Kremlin.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Bulgaria’s energy ministry said it had been told that supplies of Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline would also cease on Wednesday.\n\nOnce a close ally of Moscow, Bulgaria has cut many of its ties with Russia, supporting sanctions against Russia and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\nPrime Minister Kiril Petkov and members of his coalition government were due to travel to Kyiv on Wednesday for aid talks with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Balkan country meets more than 90% of its gas needs with Russian imports, but the government insisted that no restrictions would be imposed on domestic gas consumption would be imposed for.\n\nThe NGO Europe Beyond Coal has calculated that the EU has sent more than €41bn (£34.7bn) to Russia in payments for fossil fuels since it invaded Ukraine two months ago.\n\nPoland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, had already said he intended to ban Russian gas and oil imports by the end of the year and there has been a move to diversify to cover for losses.\n\nThe key Yamal pipeline carries natural gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, through Belarus. But the Polish government had made a clear move away from dependency by constructing a liquefied natural gas terminal in the Baltic port of Świnoujście, run by Qatari and US companies, which is capable of handling 5 bcm of gas. It is being expanded to 7.5 bcm by 2023.\n\nThe extent to which Polish industry will be able to rely on this flow is yet to be seen, however, and other countries will be worried about the development.\n\nMoscow had warned clients in March that they risked having their gas supplies cut unless they paid in roubles.\n\nThe European Commission had nevertheless said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars.\n\nThe only EU leader who has suggested he would pay Gazprom in roubles is Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, whose rightwing government has pursued a close relationship with Putin’s regime for over a decade.\n\nThe move by the Kremlin comes as EU member states are drawing up a sixth wave of sanctions that could include imposing a ceiling on the price paid for Russian oil.\n\nBut there remains a reluctance in Berlin, in particular, to go hard on gas imports given the German economy’s dependence on Russia in that field.\n\nIn early April, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told the Bundestag that the country’s energy reliance had “grown over decades and cannot be ended from one day to the next”, given that it would lead to the rationing of energy to industry and the potential closure of its largest factories.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gazprom denied that gas flows to Poland had been stopped.

Due to the extraordinary circumstances, it will be at a higher price in the beginning, but solutions will be sought in this direction as well.

The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene," the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media.\n\n3:37pm: Ukraine war has consequences for Asia, EU chief warns neutral India\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine threatens India\'s regional security, the European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Monday during a trip to New Delhi aimed at fostering deeper strategic ties.\n\nVon der Leyen is the latest visiting Western diplomat to press India, which gets most of its arms from Russia, over its neutral stance on the conflict.\n\nBoth the EU and India face challenges from a rising China, and von der Leyen raised the spectre of Beijing\'s partnership with Moscow to warn the war had consequences further afield than Europe.\n\n"The outcome of the war will not only determine the future of Europe but also deeply affect the Indo-Pacific region," she told an audience at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitical conference in New Delhi.\n\n"Russia and China have forged a seemingly unrestrained pact. They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war. Since the beginning of April, just under 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, after some 3.4 million left in March.\n\nThe UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an additional 218,000 citizens of third countries—largely students and migrant workers—have also fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began.\n\nWomen and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.\n\nBeyond the refugees, the IOM estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Ukrainian children have had to flee their homes, including those who remain in the country.\n\n2:45pm: Visit by top US officials sign of improved security situation in Kyiv\n\nA visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday is a strong sign that the security situation in Ukraine\'s capital has improved.

Unsurprisingly, many of these efforts have often been penetrated due to the poor and blatant construction exposed by the mainstream Western mass media that perhaps interact closely with the intelligence circles.\n\nBut this hardly means that Western governments and the mass media are bona fide disseminators of war information that is free from distortion and manipulation. This is because, in the modern and contemporary history of war, government propaganda is a commonplace. It is instrumental to mobilize, sustain and strengthen domestic and international support for war efforts, particularly when magnified by mass media. An underdog country can use such propaganda to enhance international support, especially through provision of weapons, ammunition, logistics and, if feasible, reinforcements, to complement its inferior war capability, as well as economic sanction against the top dog country. On the other hand, the latter can employ such a propaganda to enhance popular morale and supplement resource mobilization capacity.\n\nIn fact, Western government war propaganda and the mainstream mass media reports have established a predominant international opinion that sides sympathetically with Ukraine as the innocent underdog[i]. This is particularly because numerous video footage has lively covered massive exoduses of Ukrainian women and children to neighboring countries, missile bombardment and other forms of shelling against urban residential areas, and vivid images of killed and injured noncombatants as well as combatants, among others. Unfortunately, timely open-source information on evolving operational and tactical realities is limited, partial, unbalanced and/or, biased, possibly with intentional distortions and manipulations. Yet, the reports seem to prove atrocities committed by the Russian invasion forces, demonizing these forces and President Vladimir Putin at the levels of jus ad bellum and jus in bello.\n\nYet, war propaganda becomes unplausible and ineffective, especially when detached from evolving battlefield realities. Until then, war propaganda surely hampers coolheaded analysis and appropriate policy prescription on how to end a war, while unnecessarily protracting warfare involving a significantly higher death toll and further destruction.\n\nIn this light, this study will cast some different light on the tenability of the predominant factual recognition and discourse in mainstream Western mass media. The first jus in bello cases are about Western allegation of atrocities committed by the Russian side against Ukrainian non-combatants, particularly under the condition of extremely fierce urban warfare in the cities of Mariupol and Bucha. The second jus ad bellum case is about Russian allegation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine. These cases are particularly important because most of Western news and reports have flatly turned down Russian counterparts as misinformation and disinformation, without any serious examination. Certainly, the current author of this piece does not enjoy any privileged access to classified information but only to open sources. Yet, careful examination of open-source materials, including Russian and alternative media sources, may make it possible to identify blind assumptions and invalid judgements in the current dominant Western discourse, if not to present correct facts and cogent judgements.\n\n1. The Mariupol Case\n\n1) The Context\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky stated in his on-line speech of March 23 to the Japanese Diet that several thousand Ukrainian civilians, including 121 children, had been killed, together with nine millions refugees and internally displaced civilians[ii]. This unexpectedly low level of death toll may indicate that Russian invasion forces exercised certain self-restraint in attacking civilians, except collateral damage.\n\nIn fact, Douglas Macgregor[iii], a retired U.S. Army Colonel and a Senior Advisor to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, stated that, despite the strong impression generated by the repeated exposure to video footage, President Putin strictly ordered from the outset of the war to avoid killing civilians and destroying urban areas as much as possible[iv]. This is consistent with his historical outlook on the triune Russian national identity – White, Little and Great Russians (respectively, Belarussians, Ukrainians and Russians), characterized by strong historical unity and brotherhood[v]. Naturally ,it begs the question of why the Russian forces killed many Ukrainian civilians and severely destroyed urban residential areas in Ukraine, involving an inscrutable disjunction between Putin’s own creed and practice.\n\nExtremely fierce urban warfare, especially in the City of Mariupol, is a natural consequence of the stark disparity of Russian and Ukrainian military power, to which both sides have even introduced foreign volunteer fighters and mercenaries[vi]. With its overwhelming superiority, the Russian invasion forces neutralized a significant portion of main high-end platforms, assets and on-ground facilities of the Ukrainian armed forces at the initial stage of the current war, including air superiority fighters, major battle tanks and the command & control systems[vii]. This is consistent with numerous video footage available in public domain that primarily captures Ukrainian infantry operations with portable anti-tank missiles for close combat and low-altitude anti-air missiles, while few high-end platforms are visible. In fact, the Russian Defense Ministry said that, soon after the start of the war, the Russian forces totally destroyed Ukrainian Air Force combat aircraft while some of them escaped to Poland and Romania[viii]. Reportedly, the Russia forces destroyed 974 Ukrainian tanks and other armored vehicles just for the first three weeks[ix]. No wonder, MacGregor judged that the Ukrainian units still active “(were) completely surrounded, cut off and isolated in various town and cities”, with supplies likely running out soon[x]. Ukrainian infantry and special operation forces in Mariupol were cornered at bay without reinforcement nor air cover. An Azov Battalion commander there vainly urged the U.S.-led NATO to make armed intervention against Russia, especially to set an effective no-fly zone over Ukraine, while attributing a grave humanitarian crisis in the making to Russia。[xi]\n\n2) Who attacked the maternity hospital and the drama theater?\n\nThe Ukrainian government strongly condemned Russia for its military attack against a maternity hospital in Mariupol on March 17[xii], which injured 17 people including women, children and doctors, with at least five of them dead thereafter[xiii]. But Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov justified the attack because an Azov Battalion unit turned the hospital to a combat base[xiv], claiming the victims as unavoidable and lawful collateral damage. Surprisingly, the pregnant woman on spotlight in the reports later disclosed that Ukrainian soldiers used the hospital as base while holding these civilians as human shield against Russian forces, suggesting that the incident was an act of self-destruct and a false flag operation by the Ukraine’s side[xv]. This is compatible with other fragmentary video footage that capture how Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol have been used as human shield[xvi] and prevented from leaving the city[xvii].\n\nAlso, the Ukrainian government alleged, echoed aloud by major Western mass media, that, on March 16, a Russian airstrike dropped a powerful bomb on the Mariupol Drama Theater sheltering some 1,300 local residents, including women and children, and despite large signs of “children” that were clearly visible from aircraft. Reportedly, the death toll reached at least to 300[xviii]. The Russian government flatly denied the allegation and instead accused the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, of blowing up the theater building. This is compatible with the interview of a 17- year-old female survivor of the incident with the Abkhazian Network News Agency, who eye-witnessed Azov soldiers hiding themselves behind civilian hostages in the building[xix].\n\nMore specifically, a Russian military spokesman stated that Azov Battalion units held civilian hostages in the theater building as human shield, using the upper floor as firing points. This means that the Russian attack aimed at these units, involving significant civilian casualties as collateral damage during the engagement[xx]. This is a plausible account on what happened, particularly given the very similar circumstances of the above hospital case.\n\nIt is now crucially important to inquire what the Azov Battalion is all about and if the troop has the established notoriety of committing such atrocities.\n\n3）The Azov Battalion[xxi]\n\nThe Azov Battalion is now a part of the Ukrainian National Guard, which is the country’s gendarmerie under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Its name originates from the fact that it has been based in Mariupol in the Azov Sea costal region since 2014, first as a volunteer militia that fought against Russian separatist forces in the Donbas War and later in the same year incorporated into the National Guard while expanded in scale into a regiment. As Russia labels it as neo-Nazis, it in fact uses controversial symbols resembling the Nazis SS Wolfsangel, though it denies any connection with Nazism[xxii]. Yet, in 2015, an Azov spokesman disclosed 10-20% of units consisted of neo-Nazis members[xxiii]. The concern over the Azov is serious enough to the extent that the U.S. Congress enacted a legislative measure, Consolidated Appropriation Bill of 2018, to ban military aids to the paramilitary due to its white supremacist ideology and neo-Nazism[xxiv].\n\nThe Azov has faced serious allegations of committing torture and war crimes, including the grossly underinvestigated case of the 2014 Odessa Clashes in which some 50 pro-Russia separatists were killed[xxv]. In fact, the U.N. Human Rights Office of High Commissioner published reports that connect the Azov Battalion to war crimes such as mass looting, unlawful detention, and torture[xxvi]. Clearly. Russia’s counter-allegations on the above atrocities in Mariupol are at least compatible with an established understanding on Azov’s behavioral pattern connected to war crimes.\n\nActually, Russia’s emphasis and Western de-emphasis on the Azov Battalion is obscurely central to their intensified exchanges of war propaganda and counter-propaganda, on the ground that the paramilitary has constituted a major U.S instrument of covert military intervention in Russia-Ukraine armed conflict. More specifically, the CIA had a secret advisory and training program for Ukrainian paramilitaries and militias, most probably including the Azov, for eight years until shortly before the start of the current war, despite the aforementioned legislative ban. The CIA has had training centers in the U.S. and eastern Ukraine for sniper techniques[xxvii], anti-tank missile handling, covert communications, and other tactics necessary for insurgency and counter-insurgency[xxviii]. Thus, the issue of the Azov Battalion cannot simply be reduced to the question of war crimes, but can only be fully comprehended in the context of a U.S.-Russia proxy war over the Donbas region that is central to NATO expansion to Ukraine and determination of their spheres of interest.\n\n2. The Bucha Case\n\nA similar suspicion of war propaganda is not easily excludable, with a focus on the atrocities allegedly committed by the Russian armed forces against local Ukrainian civilians in the city of Bucha. Major Western governments and the mainstream mass media are condemning, with strongest terms, the unspeakable atrocities against local Ukrainian civilians on the way of retreat after hard battles to vainly capture Kiev. However, on March 31 when the Russian forces left the city, its mayor did not at all mention of the atrocities in an interview with a Ukrainian on-line news site[xxix] which is compatible with his bright expression in a selfie video taken on the same day[xxx]. On April 2, when Ukrainian army forces entered the city to make sure of a complete retreat of the Russian forces, the video footage by a local news media captured no corpse on roads and no sign of emotional distress among the local population. On April 1, Azov Battalion troops entered the city[xxxi], and on April 3, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense released video footage as evidence of the atrocities committed by the Russian forces, which neither the New York Times nor the Pentagon are independently able to verify the assertion of the Ministry[xxxii]. In addition, in the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. and the U.K. blocked Russia’s proposal to send an independent fact-finding mission to Ukraine[xxxiii].\n\nThus, there is a good possibility that the Azov Battalion might have fabricated or purposefully committed at least some parts of the “atrocities” by itself[xxxiv]. (More specifically, to differentiate which camp they belong, pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian civilians wear blue or white armbands respectively. Many corpses in Bucha wore white armbands as in video footage available. The Azov and/or other ultra-right militia units may have committed the atrocities out of emotional impulse, while the mass media and propaganda section of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs may have made up the scene to impute responsibilities of war crime to the Russian invasion forces[xxxv]. It should be reminded that the current war has the dimension of ethnic conflict as well as that of inter-state war.)\n\nGiven the leading role of BBC reports on this matter with the analysis of a satellite image, this begs the question of if the U.K. intelligence circles are engaged in elaborate war propaganda against Russia to mislead and manipulate other major Western governments and mass media[xxxvi].\n\n3. The Case of Biological Weapon R&D\n\nPossession of weapon of mass destruction by a revisionist power may constitute a casus belli of a status quo power, particularly when the latter sees the former’s move as its existential threat or serious threat against its vital national interests. Yet, legitimatizing a war has to satisfy some procedural requirements according to international law with presentation of solid evidence to the international society.\n\nIn this light, Russia’s allegation on Ukraine’s nuclear weapon programs is not tenable at all, at least at this point, due to its abrupt aggression against Ukraine without presenting any substantial evidence[xxxvii]. Also, there are little significant related information in public domain, though Ukraine has active nuclear power plants with some substantial potential to develop nuclear weapons as the country was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nBut Russia’s accusation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine, as articulated with a trove of original documentation by Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, Commander of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troop of the Russian Army[xxxviii], is not totally deniable but seems plausible with open-source information[xxxix]. Most remarkably, Victoria Nuland, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, admitted the existence of biolaboratories in Ukraine under the bilateral cooperative programs of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency during a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations[xl], while the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department unequivocally denied U.S.-funded biological weapon laboratories in Ukraine[xli]. In addition, an official letter from an official in charge at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to a project manager of Black & Veatch, a DTRA contractor, attests to their significant collaborative research relationship, while another official letter from an official in charge at the DTRA office in Kiev to an official in charge at the Ukraine Ministry Defense indicates their clear awareness of the potential usefulness of their research collaboration for biological weapon development[xlii].\n\nCertainly, the Agency’s Biological Threat Reduction Programs may serve bona fide statutory purposes, not designed to contribute to virus and other biological weapon R&D. Yet, suspicion remains, given that the offense and defense of biological warfare is generally the head and tail of similar biological weapon technologies while there is no clear demarcation line between military and civil research in most advanced virus and other biological R&D that involves genetic manipulation. The lack of confidence in the sectoral culture has recently become worse because Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the President Biden, hid the fact before a Senate hearing that the EcoHealth Alliance, New York City-based nonprofit organization, funneled U.S. public funds to gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses at China’s Wuhan lab, making it feasible to bypass stringent domestic regulations and strict public eyes. The experiment is suspected potentially useful for biological weapon R&D, and a virus leak from the lab might have been a primary cause of the current COVIT-19 pandemic[xliii].\n\n4. Reflection\n\nHitherto, this investigative inquiry has cast significant doubt and suspicion on the established Western discourse that sided uncritically with Ukraine in its war against hyper-demonized Russia, almost exclusively on the basis of Western government war information and mass media reports, and without carefully checking Russian reports.\n\nOf course, Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine is utterly indisputable, and a great number of innocent Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the current war, either in atrocity or collateral damage. But who killed how many civilians and in what ways is not self-evident as reported in the Western media, especially in the context of ethnic conflict and urban warfare as the world learnt from gross information manipulation in the former Yugoslavia ethnic conflict[xliv]. It is increasingly necessary to check Western reports carefully against Russian ones, while verifying the authenticity of allegedly “original” U.S. documents presented by the Russian government and mass media. The U.S. government will be accountable, if verified.\n\nInundated with propaganda and counter-propaganda both by the West and Russia day after day, both political leaders and the public in the West will suffer self-poisoning effect of the hyper-demonized image of Russia on making coolheaded policy analysis. It is high time that the Western governments and mainstream mass media recalibrate war propaganda and counter-propaganda, in view of the need to think of how to end the current war and to keep diplomatic channels open with Russia that would most unlikely capitulate, given that it is a nuclear power coequal to the United States.\n\n[i] Despite the current image of an innocent victim, Ukraine has continually played a disturbing role to Asian and international security, particularly because it sold an ex-Soviet aircraft career, Varyag, as scrap to China, that has been already repaired and commissioned as the country’s first aircraft career, Liaoning; and because Ukraine has not effectively banned outflows of ballistic missile technologies to North Korea that has significantly contributed to the development of its nuclear weapon programs.

EU countries have largely refused that demand, saying it breaks contracts denominated in dollars and euros.\n\nThe European Commission said that such payments would violate EU sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nPGNiG said it continued "to settle its liabilities for natural gas delivered under the Yamal Contract in accordance with its current terms."\n\nThe Polish utility demanded that Gazprom resume gas deliveries. If that doesn\'t happen, it warned: "the Company reserves the right to claim damages."\n\n"There is no contractual basis for the suspension of the supply of the gas delivered under the Yamal Contract," PGNiG said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Gazprom spokesperson Sergey Kupriyanov told reporters in Moscow: "Poland is obliged to pay for gas supplies in accordance with the new payment procedure," according to the official TASS news agency.\n\nBulgaria also balked at the demand to pay in rubles. The new Russian payment system is "at odds with the agreement that is effective until the end of this year and poses considerable risks for the Bulgarian side," said the energy ministry.\n\nPoland has vowed to end imports of Russian coal, gas and oil, and is pressing other EU countries to rapidly do the same.\n\n"We are prepared for the complete cut off of Russian fossil fuels," Polish Energy Minister Anna Moskwa said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nPoland gets 46 percent of its gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia, according to Forum Energii, a think tank.\n\nPolish authorities insisted that the cutoff won\'t affect gas users.\n\n"Thanks to the implementation of the government\'s strategy of diversifying gas supply sources, PGNiG is prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on the western and southern borders and the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście," said PGNiG.\n\nMoskwa said: "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security," adding that the country\'s gas storage was 80 percent full. She said Poland will continue to buy gas on European and international markets and aims to fill its reserves to 100 percent.\n\nBulgaria, which gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia, said it has "taken steps to ensure alternative supplies of natural gas and handle the situation.

Schwedt, which is run by Russia\'s state-owned Rosneft, supplies the vast majority of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region with fuel.\n\nA lack of oil infrastructure linking the former West and East Germany means the country\'s eastern states would have been hit especially hard by an import stop — but a solution is close at hand, Habeck said.\n\nDealing with Schwedt "is the last task that still stands in the way of completely securing the energy supply. I can already say that an [oil] embargo has become manageable for Germany."\n\nHabeck was in Warsaw to work out if oil refineries in eastern Germany could in part be supplied with shipments via the Polish port of Gdańsk, and he said the two countries were working together on the issue.\n\nThe trouble with Schwedt, he said, was its majority owner.\n\n"Rosneft\'s business model is to buy Russian oil, and that is exactly the bone of contention: If we don\'t want Russian oil anymore we need an alternative for Schwedt," he said. "To develop this is the task of the next days — and yes, I hope only days."\n\nAs for Germany\'s remaining fossil fuel dependence on Russia, he said Berlin was on track to finding alternative coal supply to comply with the EU\'s embargo; the bloc decided earlier this month to end Russian coal purchases by August.\n\nThe issue of natural gas, he acknowledged, would not be solved as quickly. The share of Russian imports is now at 40 percent, down from 55 percent before the war. Germany gets its gas via pipelines, but it aims to build capacity to take liquefied natural gas.\n\n"Concerning gas, we are working hard to overcome the high dependency that Germany had — and that was a mistake — by building up LNG capacity," Habeck said.\n\nDaniel Günther, the premier of Schleswig-Holstein, said Tuesday that he expected the floating LNG terminal in his region to be operational by the start of next year.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26/GettyImages-1239928463-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:31'}

"We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nPutin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia\'s military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.\n\nGuterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (see 2:02pm, below) for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\n6:45pm: Blinken says Putin not \'serious\' about Ukraine diplomacy\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the Ukraine war, despite a series of international efforts.\n\n“We’ve seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: “Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table.”\n\nBlinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlinken hailed what he saw on the trip and said that the US was speeding up arms deliveries, with the process now often taking only 72 hours after Ukraine sends requests.\n\n6:10pm: Germany confirms plans to send Ukraine tanks, in policy shift\n\nGermany said Tuesday it would send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a clear switch in Berlin’s cautious policy on military backing for Kyiv that was welcomed by the United States.\n\nThe government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the US Ramstein airbase.\n\nThe move comes after heavy criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to Ukraine, despite announcing a “turning point” in German defence policy in response to Russia’s invasion.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the pledge to send “some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems”, the English name for the weapons, was “especially welcome”.\n\n5:19pm: US Defence Secretary says US, allies to meet monthly on arming Ukraine\n\nThe United States and its allies will meet once a month to discuss Ukraine\'s defence needs to battle invading Russian troops, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.\n\n"Today\'s gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine\'s self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\n4:53pm: FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg on the fallout over blasts in Transnistria, Moldova\n\n02:48 © FRANCE 24\n\n4:08pm: Putin, Erdogan discuss humanitarian corridors in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow’s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin statement, the leaders in a phone call talked about “efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors”.\n\nThis came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.\n\nThe Kremlin said Erdogan asked Putin about the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe Russian leader told him that “the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there”.\n\n3:09pm: Nearly 5.3 million flee Ukraine war as refugees, up more than 32,000 since Monday\n\nNearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.\n\nIn total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 32,753 over Monday\'s figure.\n\nWhile the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday (see 11:31am, below) that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.\n\n2:02 pm: Guterres says Russia, UN have \'very different\' views of events in Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had "very frank" discussions with Lavrov. He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Le Drian “reiterated France\'s request for the free movement of civilians and free access for humanitarian aid in Mariupol, as in the rest of Ukraine”, the statement noted.\n\nFrance is delivering Caesar cannons with a range of 40 kilometres (25 miles) to Ukraine and is among 40 countries attending the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group meeting hosted by the US at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nJ’ai souhaité confirmer à mon homologue ukrainien @DmytroKuleba que la France maintiendrait son appui déterminé à l’Ukraine face à la guerre à laquelle elle est confrontée : assistance financière, sanctions, équipements de défense, lutte contre l’impunité. pic.twitter.com/9OgtKltUar — Jean-Yves Le Drian (@JY_LeDrian) April 26, 2022\n\n10:32 am: ‘Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine’: US defence chief Austin\n\nOpening the gathering of representatives of more than 40 countries at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called on members of the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group to arrive at “a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to move heaven and earth so that we can meet them”.\n\nAustin, who is chairing the meeting at the US air base, said Kyiv had done “an impressive job defending its sovereignty against Russia’s unprovoked invasion”, adding: "“Ukraine’s valor and skill will go down in military history.”\n\n“Ukraine has now beaten back the Russian military for 62 days. Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\n06:12am: Russia’s Lavrov warns of ‘real threat’ of World War III\n\nRussia has warned of the “real” threat of World War III breaking out, ahead of a Tuesday meeting between the United States and allies over sending further arms to war-torn Ukraine.\n\nMoscow’s invasion of its neighbour has triggered an outburst of support from Western nations that has seen weapons pour into the country to help it wage war against Russian troops.\n\nBut Western powers have been reluctant to deepen their involvement, for fear of sparking a conflict against nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nSpeaking to Russian news agencies, Moscow’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the risk of a World War III “is serious” and criticised Kyiv’s approach to floundering peace talks.\n\n“It is real, you can’t underestimate it,” Lavrov said.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Vedika Bahl brings us a recap of Monday’s events:\n\n01:49 Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, April 7, 2022. © Reuters\n\n04:36am: Pressure mounts on Germany’s Schroeder over Russia ties\n\nPressure was growing Monday inside Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) to expel their former leader and ex-chancellor Gerhard Schroeder over his apparent refusal to renounce his business ties with Russia.\n\nSchroeder, who is a lobbyist for Russian gas and has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, sparked fresh outrage following remarks in an interview with the New York Times published this weekend.\n\nUnrepentant over his business links with Russia, he told the newspaper: “I don’t do mea culpa. It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and REUTERS)\n\n© Studio graphique France Médias Monde\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/e48d305a-c59a-11ec-898c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/20220426-gazprom-m.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:50'}

In Borodyanka, near Kyiv — in the midst of the destruction and devastation — I and the presidents of the other Baltic states and Poland stood and stared at the ghastly face of war. I thought of my own children and grandchildren, and I was overwhelmed by sadness and grief.\n\nAs Europe, we failed. We failed because we were unable to dissuade Russian President Vladimir Putin from starting his war. And every town and village Russia now takes in Ukraine is part of our failure. Every Ukrainian hurt, killed or deported from their home adds to our failure, as do the millions of Ukrainian war refugees in every European country.\n\nIt is important that we start helping Ukraine more effectively, more visibly and more boldly. Russia’s goal is to destroy the existing Ukrainian state; our goal is to prevent that from happening. The time has come for us to shake off our fear and start making courageous decisions.\n\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter states that a U.N. member has the inherent right to individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against it. I emphasize the word “collective” because it underscores a very important point: Ukraine has the right to defend itself, and the rest of us, for whom the charter is an essential cornerstone of international relations, have a duty to help. This is what the collective self-defense of Ukraine means.\n\nWe must do everything we can to ensure Ukraine’s strong military resistance and the sanctions isolating Russia make the cost of the war so high for Moscow that it is eventually forced to back down.\n\nEconomic sanctions must be strong and effective, without exception, and for immediate implementation. This means some inconvenience for us, but just look at the footage of Ukrainian towns and villages after the departure of the Russian army. When we look into the face of Putin’s war, we realize that the inconveniences we experience under the umbrella of the European Union and NATO are nothing compared to the suffering of Ukrainians.\n\nIt’s time to embrace debates that involve thinking outside the box. We need an oil embargo, and we need it now. By paying Russia for energy, we continue to finance its war. Let us not forget that 60 percent of Russia’s oil exports are to Europe, and that last year, the Kremlin earned €180 billion from the sale of crude oil and petroleum products.\n\nAs for gas, Estonia has made a proposal to the EU, which is being referred to as “escrow”: Part of the payment for gas will be made directly to Russia, while the other part will be transferred to a separate account, frozen for Ukraine, which will be able to use it in the future to rebuild its destroyed nation. Gas cannot be put back into the ground, so there is no reason to fear that we will receive no gas if we implement this proposal.\n\nThe head of the U.N. World Food Programme, David Beasley, has also warned us that the war in Ukraine will lead to the worst food crisis since World War II — and World Bank President David Malpass acknowledged this. As such, we must discuss whether and how, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the U.N. Charter, we could provide direct support, upon the invitation of the Ukrainian government, to keep the port of Odesa open for Ukrainian grain ships.\n\nUkrainians say they have 20 million metric tons of grain in storage silos — probably 50 million with this year’s harvest — and if it remains in storage, there will be no sowing in the coming years. It is not possible to transport this quantity to the world market by rail — there is simply too much of it.\n\nWestern countries should establish a military presence in part of the Black Sea to ensure the safe movement of commercial and humanitarian aid vessels. Surely, some will argue against this and say that no one would take such a risk. But in the end, it is a question of our willingness to meet humanitarian needs. And where there is a will, there is a way.\n\nUkraine also needs weapons to defend itself, both those that its military knows how to use and more modern, effective weaponry that requires rapid training. We can offer them this training. As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its next phase, we should work more on the planning and coordination of military aid, helping to ensure that Ukraine’s most critical needs are met. This would truly be an effective signal of our unity.\n\nThe war in Europe affects us all; no one can ignore it. To do so would be to betray Europe. And only effective sanctions and Ukraine’s continued courage will eventually bring us to a point where Russia starts discussing a ceasefire in a meaningful and serious way. Only then will peace finally be possible.\n\nBut our goal must be a peace to which Ukrainians agree. We are not pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to give in, pushing the idea that a bad peace is still better than war. We will not accept a peace that Ukraine is forced to settle for because it has missiles pointed at it.\n\n“This war will only be won by Ukraine,” wrote Eero Epner, a well-known Estonian director and journalist, who visited Kyiv alongside myself and my fellow Polish and Baltic presidents. “But if it is lost, Ukraine will not be the one that loses it: we will be the ones who lose it.”\n\nWe cannot — we must not — lose.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25/GettyImages-1240213966-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:21'}

Belarusians are a joke — as Russia\'s creeping annexation of their country suggests. And Ukrainians are delusional fascists with no right to exist — as Russian president Vladimir Putin has openly stated.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nGermany isn\'t quite as arrogant in its views of its eastern neighbours, but neither is it as welcoming as the open-hearted German self-image would suggest.\n\nFor Berlin, Poles are difficult — failing to appreciate that they need to follow Germany\'s sage example if they want to be fully European. The pejorative term "Polnische Wirtschaft" (meaning "Polish household") is no longer in use, but the sentiment remains.\n\nBelarusians are a cypher ruled by a dictator, while Ukrainians are hopelessly corrupt and quarrelsome — or were, until Russia attacked Ukraine on 24 February and unleashed a genocidal war.\n\nMeanwhile, continued German reference to World War II as the "Russlandkrieg" (meaning "Russia War") nicely illustrates ongoing German attitudes.\n\nGermany attacked, occupied, and destroyed huge swaths of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. Belarus lost about a third of its population, Poland and Ukraine a little under a fifth, and Jews, who lived in all three countries, were subjected to almost complete annihilation in the Holocaust.\n\nBy that grim comparison, Russia actually remained largely untouched — a Russia War indeed.\n\nThe current war on Ukraine has only reinforced Russia\'s dismissive attitudes toward Poles, Belarusians, and Ukrainians.\n\nFor Moscow, the Poles are "chronic Russo-phobes," Belarusians are unreliable allies, and Ukrainians must be destroyed.\n\nThe war has also begun to change German perceptions, most notably with respect to Ukrainians. Berlin has condemned the Russian aggression, adopted severe sanctions, mothballed the Nord Stream II pipeline, and supplied Ukraine with arms.\n\nBut old habits die hard — former German chancellor Angela Merkel still refuses to admit that her policies toward Russia enabled Putin.\n\nFormer chancellor Gerhard Schröder remains an unrepentant Putin apologist and a tacit supporter of Putin\'s genocide in Ukraine.\n\nDüsseldorf\'s ex-mayor, Thomas Geisel, a social democrat like Schröder, openly questions whether Russian atrocities in Ukraine are really as serious as Ukrainians say they are, while a group of left-wingers is calling on the German government to stop delivering arms to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to German analyst Constanze Stelzenmueller: "Germany\'s self-serving Russia policy and its self-inflicted energy dependence — part wilfully naive, part deeply corrupt — found eager supporters across the political party spectrum. They emboldened the Kremlin, and they enabled Vladimir Putin\'s war."\n\nThe fact is that, just as Russia\'s distaste for its eastern neighbours includes pretty much the whole spectrum of relevant political elites, so, too, Germany\'s prioritising of Russia still remains the default position of its establishment.\n\nSo, when German finance minister Christian Lindner said on 23 April that "we must do everything in our power to help Ukraine win, but the limit of the ethical responsibility is endangering our own security and endangering the defence capability of Nato territory," one appreciates his concern for Ukraine, but one also notes that he all but openly says Germany\'s security is not dependent on Ukraine, while it is dependent on Russia.\n\nGreat power games\n\nWhy do Germany and Russia think so much alike about their neighbours in between?\n\nThe answer may lie in history and in geopolitics: both countries have been great powers since the mid-18th century and their "natural" field of contention and cooperation has been eastern Europe. It stands to reason that their mental maps of the region would be similar.\n\nUnsurprisingly, eastern Europeans often view their relationship with Germany and Russia as similar to being trapped between a hammer and an anvil.\n\nAnd with good reason — modern history is full of examples of Russo-German conflict and cooperation resulting in death and destruction for the countries in between.\n\nRussia and Prussia (the forerunner of modern Germany) colluded in three partitions of Poland in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nWilhelmine Germany and Tsarist Russia were on opposing sides in World War I, and most of the warfare took place in today\'s Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland.\n\nIn 1922, Soviet Russia and Weimar Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo, thereby recognising each other diplomatically and opening the door to economic and military cooperation that enabled Germany to rearm. The losers were, once again, the newly independent states of eastern Europe.\n\nRusso-German relations temporarily worsened after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, but collaboration resumed after a Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in 1939, resulting in the fourth Polish partition and Russian aggression against the Baltic states.\n\nTwo years later, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and, as during the previous world war, the death and destruction were centred on the peoples of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine.\n\nPost-war Germany\'s policy of Ostpolitik led to a normalisation of relations with the Communist regimes of the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany, but eastern European democratic dissidents paid the price.\n\nFormer German chancellor Willy Brandt urged the Solidarność trade union movement in Poland to stop striking in 1980, and then, in 1985, while on an official state visit, purposely refrained from meeting with Solidarność activists, clearly signalling who Bonn\'s preferred interlocutors were and where Germany\'s interests supposedly lay.\n\nThe revolutions of 1989, Germany\'s reunification in 1990, and the Soviet Union\'s collapse in 1991 paved the way for the pro-Russian and pro-Putin policies that helped make Europe dependent on Russian gas, demonised Ukraine as irredeemably corrupt, and ignored the telltale signs of Putin\'s openly aggressive stance toward Russia\'s neighbours.\n\nGermany\'s neglect of its eastern neighbours and Russia\'s hostility to them facilitated the ongoing genocidal war.\n\nNo more great powers\n\nInasmuch as eastern Europeans have suffered both when Germany and Russia have fought and when they have cooperated, the solution to this problem has to be geopolitical.\n\nIn the short run, that means Ukraine\'s victory over Russia.\n\nIn the long run, Germany must remain a middle power and Russia must be denied great-power status. De-Putinizing the regime will help, but the only durable solution for peace is for Russia to break apart.', 'image': 'https://media.euobserver.com/771665bd9becd54a78aff46c75478260-800x.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:09'}

She recalled how she "got caught in the hail of bombs" as a child with her Jewish mother in the city of Kharkiv and then survived in the Ural Mountains, where "a kind-hearted Russian woman took us in."\n\nSabundkina also remembers postwar Kyiv, when German soldiers, prisoners of war, helped to rebuild the destroyed city. She shared her school lunch with one of them: "I felt sorry for him."\n\nGermany\'s Steinmeier told the group of six Holocaust survivors, who escaped Ukraine to Germany despite their advanced ages, "It breaks my heart to meet people who have had to flee a war twice in their lives and now don\'t know if they will ever be able to return home."\n\nSteinmeier listens to Neyman\'s story\n\n\'Vicious cynicism\'\n\nSteinmeier said he was deeply affected by their stories. He spoke of the "truly vicious cynicism" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had cited the baseless claim of "denazification" as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine. The stories of these survivors, Steinmeier said, are proof of Putin\'s hypocrisy.\n\nMost of them come from eastern Ukraine, specifically Dnipro, a city that has been hit by Russian missiles almost every day for weeks. Steinmeier asked whether they were all transported by bus, to which Neyman responded that it took three days in an ambulance to get to the Ukrainian-Polish border. All six of them traveled to Poland, she said, and then on to Germany.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Steinmeier spoke of his mother, who was among the many ethnic Germans expelled from Poland at the end of World War II. "We were always very aware of what it means to lose your house and home and have to start over completely again," he said.\n\nSteinmeier\'s visit was well-received by the group of elderly survivors, one of whom asked for a selfie as he left. The others thanked him when he told them: "You are welcome here, you can rely on our help."\n\nThis reception came in stark contrast to the criticism directed at the president in recent weeks, which saw Kyiv refuse his offer of an official visit after he was accused of being too sympathetic to Russia during his two terms as foreign minister. Instead of traveling to Ukraine, he has been meeting displaced Ukrainians in Germany as well as Ukraine\'s Eastern European neighbors.\n\nJewish groups organize evacuations\n\nSo far, nearly 80 Holocaust survivors have fled to Germany from Ukraine and are being housed across the country.\n\nThe "El Jana" home in eastern Berlin is still fairly new. The full-time care facility was completed shortly before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and has not yet been fully occupied. Although the building is subjected to the roar of the nearby airport, street traffic, and trains, the building is an oasis of peace for its new inhabitants.\n\nThat the dozens of survivors have made it to Germany is thanks to the commitment and help from the Jewish Claims Conference (JCC), an organization that has been providing financial and medical assistance to Holocaust survivors for years.\n\nAs soon as they realized that the Russian invasion could jeopardize that assistance, the JCC set to work organizing evacuations. At first, only a handful wanted to leave their homes, but that number gradually increased, according to Rüdiger Mahlo, the JCC\'s representative in Germany.\n\nFor those who did not want to come to Germany, evacuations were also organized for Israel or other European destinations.\n\nWatch video 00:59 Ukrainian Holocaust survivors take shelter in Germany\n\nHelping hands\n\nAccording to Mahlo, more evacuees are arriving in Germany every day, a process that required around 50 people from 15 different organizations, including the Central Welfare Office of Jews in Germany (ZWST). Those assisting on a daily basis include full-time employees of welfare associations, but also many volunteers.\n\nAid workers have also been quick to thank the support of locals, who have donated the clothes, medical equipment, and other necessities that the new arrivals need.\n\nFor the El Jana facility, this also means a demanding commitment from employees who speak Russian, according to director Laura Rose. "For them, it means twelve-hour shifts now. There must always be someone there, even at night and on weekends, who speaks Russian," she said.\n\nAlthough the survivors thanked Steinmeier for the hospitality they have received in Germany, they made it clear that their wish for the future is to return to Ukraine.\n\n"Thank you for the very warm welcome. But still, we all want to go home as soon as possible," they told the president.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you\'re here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

This issue of New Eastern Europe brings you some tales and reflections of the brave Ukrainians who have united to fight the invading aggressor.\n\nThese stories provide a distinct account – some of which are written in a diary format – of the first month of the war, the incredibly horrible period when Russian troops were brutally attacking villages on the road to Kyiv and elsewhere in the country. The disturbing images of the Russian inhumanity only emerged after the Ukrainians successfully defended the areas around the capital.\n\nThis issue also analyses the impact that the war has or will have on the region and beyond. Our authors examine the sanctions against Russia, the role of Belarus in the war, Poland’s new position as a frontline country as well as the future of Russia’s relations with the West. A significant development of the wartime has been not only the unity of the European Union and NATO but also the fact that all three countries known as the Associated Trio (Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia) have officially submitted applications to become members of the EU. These developments clearly demonstrate that the war has not only brought tragic results, but historical ones as well.\n\nLastly, the issue provides a look at the extraordinary level of human response to the war, including humanitarian activities and the welcoming of refugees.

Once referred to as the European ‘hegemon’ during the euro crisis, Berlin is now showing hesitance and indecisiveness instead of leading Europe through what could be described as the crisis of the century.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany has been pressing the brakes the hardest when it comes to European efforts to put the spoiler of international peace in its place.\n\nIn almost every sanction round – from banning Russia from SWIFT in March to the current issue of energy imports – Germany is one of the last countries to drop its opposition and clear the way for joint EU action against the aggressor.\n\nThe same picture emerges when it comes to weapons deliveries, where Germany is still hesitant to provide Ukraine with the tanks they need to fend off the Russians in Donbas.\n\nGiven the current political fiasco, it is hard to believe that Germany was once feared as reaching an almost hegemonic position in Europe during the euro crisis, where it managed to impose its vision of austerity on the continent.\n\nBut how did we get here, and why is Europe’s economic powerhouse lacking any serious capacity to guide us through this crisis?\n\nThe easy answer is, of course, to point the finger at Chancellor Olaf Scholz and say he is the one stalling the process and showing indecisiveness in Ukraine’s hour of need. Something like this would have never happened if Angela Merkel were still in power, critics utter in Berlin and Brussels.\n\nHowever, this is only part of the story. While Scholz’s leadership skills have been criticised in recent weeks – even by his coalition partners in the FDP and the Greens – the problem is much more profound.\n\nFor Germany, foreign policy was always rooted in its economic interests. It resembled more of an external economic policy instead of focusing on the tough decisions that come with the mess that is international security.\n\nLeadership in Europe meant, first and foremost, protecting its economic interests and spreading its ordoliberal model across Europe.\n\nThis ‘economy first’ approach was, of course, also the reason why Berlin could exert dominance during the euro and Greek debt crisis because all that foreign policy was about was economics.\n\nIn hindsight, it almost feels as if Germany stumbled through the messy place that is international security blindfolded. After all, Merkel was responsible for Germany’s energy dependency on Russia.\n\nAnd economic interests once again prevailed over security concerns when she disregarded the warnings by allies and laid the groundwork for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline – only a few years after Russia revealed its true colours in Ukraine and annexed Crimea.\n\nGermany managed to lead Europe as long as the EU was primarily concerned with questions of economic integration and the problems that come with it.

The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nOn February 24th 2022 the world awoke to the news that the Russian Federation had begun a brutal invasion and attack from land, sea and air against independent and free Ukraine. That terrible winter morning confirmed that the evidence gathered by US intelligence and shared with the world weeks before was indeed correct. Russia’s large-scale military invasion was inevitable. It was to take place, despite our utter disbelief.\n\nRussia’s plan of mass aggression directed at the Ukrainian people could also have been gathered from the televised speech that Vladimir Putin delivered on February 21st, just a few days before the invasion. In this over one-hour-long gloomy talk to the Russian nation (and indeed the whole world), Putin bluntly declared his hatred of the former republics, now independent states, and bitterness over the collapse of the Soviet Union. The communist state’s breakup is for him, as we have long known, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. Today, it is crystal clear that Putin will not spare anything that humanity holds dear in order to restore the Russian empire and halt the NATO alliance from accepting new members.\n\nCowardice and denial\n\nThe brutality of the Russian army since the start of the invasion not only shows that Putin has no respect for international norms or human lives, but also that his own state – the Russian Federation – has become a repressive fascist system. The infamous letter “Z”, first painted on Russian military vehicles, has now become an explicit symbol of this fascism. But the truth is that Russia has been on the totalitarian path for quite some time now. We have just refused to accept this, naively believing that the lessons of the Second World War had been internalised long ago and its atrocities would never be repeated. This was especially true immediately after the Cold War, when it appeared that liberal democracy would prevail worldwide as part of the “end of history”.\n\nToday, when news about Russia’s hideous crimes against the Ukrainian nation reaches us daily, we have to admit that Russia acted in this way partly because of our own cowardice and denial. To put it honestly, it was us, the international community, that absolved the Russian Federation from accountability for its many brutal invasions in the past. These actions started with Moldova and Chechnya in the 1990s, then Georgia, Syria, Crimea and Donbas in the first and second decades of the 21st century. Like now in Ukraine, all these other places witnessed the Russian army commit crimes against humanity. Yet, instead of punishing those responsible for the atrocities in our international system of justice, we stood by, silently watching as the Kremlin ordered the murders of those who had openly opposed them in Russia and abroad.\n\nAmong those who were killed is Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered for informing the world on the reality of the Second Chechen War. Natalya Estemirova, a human rights activist, was also assassinated in Chechnya for similar reasons. We all remember the murder of Boris Nemtsov, who was killed for his reports on the Russian military intervention in Donbas. The closure of Memorial – an organisation that investigated Stalin’s brutal crimes – should have been no surprise as the totalitarian regime began closing its ranks internally.\n\nAnd while we may have been shocked by all these events and even expressed our anger publicly, we did very little to prevent them from happening again. Some in the West believed that these were even isolated incidents or that business with Russia did not necessarily mean business with those killers responsible for these horrible yet largely ignored crimes. Russian disinformation and propaganda fuelled ignorance and provided a cover for those who valued business over morals, and profits over lives.\n\nInformation pervasion\n\nRussia also gained a foothold in many of our own countries, often exploiting corrupt politicians and disseminating state-sponsored fake news and disinformation that inflamed internal divides. By allowing Russia Today, later RT, and Sputnik, primarily broadcast in English (the global lingua franca, but also translated into many other languages), to frequent our media landscape, we believed that we were adhering to our cherished democratic values like freedom of speech. Under the impression that these channels were offering “a different perspective”, we allowed Putin’s sick vision of restoring the Russian empire to take root in our societies and Kremlin-created narratives meant to divide us to enter into our discourse.\n\nThus, in 2014, instead of talking about the Russian war against Ukraine, we could read about a “civil conflict” in Ukraine; “the Ukrainian crisis”; and the problem of “Ukrainian nationalists”. These phrases, however, as many finally learnt in 2021 and 2022, were only to serve as a background for a much stronger lie. It was uttered by Putin himself and used as a pretext to start the current war. He falsely stated that Ukraine has no historical right to exist and even requires “denazification”.\n\nThe “denazification” of a state whose president is Jewish is obviously a groundless argument. Yet, we have to admit that many politicians in our own countries have long been under the influence of Russia. Thanks to this, we have witnessed many destructive trends that have severely damaged not only the operations of our state institutions and political processes, but also brought on deep divisions within our highly polarised societies. Almost any issue that requires a democratic choice has become prey to Russian manipulation via its disinformation machine, online trolls, bots and useful idiots. This is true for elections, but also COVID-19, Brexit, abortion rights, race relations, LGBTQ+ rights and many other issues. Instead of adequately diagnosing the sources of these divisions, we eagerly joined in; fanning the flames that were stoked by Russia’s interference. While we cannot blame Russia for everything wrong within our own societies, we do need to acknowledge all the risks it poses to our social cohesion through echo-chambers, bubbles and cancel culture.\n\nOur money also allowed Russia to grow. We nourished the monster in the Kremlin through vast and numerous business deals that we now find so difficult to free ourselves from. For some, business with Russia is still acceptable even if their daily news reports highlight the inhumane blockade of Mariupol and the shelling of breadlines in Kharkiv. Several EU member states remain prone to pressure from Russia, having ignored repeated calls for the diversification of their energy supply.\n\nWho provoked who?\n\nUnfortunately, there are still commentators, politicians and opinion makers in the West who continue to act as useful idiots for the Kremlin by claiming that it is NATO’s fault Russia invaded Ukraine. They say that NATO provoked the conflict and Russia is only acting in its own self-defence. Is Moscow defending itself by brutally killing civilians in the thousands? By destroying entire cities and forcibly moving their populations to various regions in Russia, including the Far East? How we can even point the finger at anyone else beyond Putin and his regime is still a deep-seated mystery. Besides, NATO does not “expand”; it has an “open door policy”. In other words, if a country wishes or decides that it is in its own best interests to join the Alliance, NATO will welcome them into the family after it conforms to the highest western standards. Seeing how Russia assaults those who even consider joining NATO, we should not doubt the importance of the Alliance. What if Poland did not decide to join NATO in 1999 and waited to announce such intentions until 2015? It would not take much imagination to fathom how Putin would have reacted in such a scenario. The argument that NATO provoked Russia is another example of the Russian narrative being regurgitated in mainstream western media. The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nNot that long ago, we were disgusted by the revelations in Alexei Navalny’s film about Putin’s mansion. But no one really bothered to speak up against the gas pipeline that allowed him to reach such levels of wealth. Many in the West in fact never felt obliged enough to see their business with Russia as an act of corruption. Yet many of them were eager to point to Ukraine as being corrupt and hence unable to “meet European democratic standards”. We expected Ukrainians to listen to our guidelines on what modern statehood should look like, but their arguments (or those in Poland or the Baltic states) on why Nord Stream 2 is dangerous for the region and our security went ignored, written off as wild “Russophobia”.\n\nNow, Europe and the West face their greatest challenge since the end of the Cold War and perhaps since the outbreak of the Second World War. The refugee crisis that the Russian forces have now set in motion through their indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine will be an immense and lengthy test. The tactics of total war have already forced a large percentage of Ukraine’s future beyond its borders. It must remain a priority for the international community to provide them with care and safety. Pushing these masses of civilians into Poland, Romania and Moldova in particular is also part of the Russian strategy to put these countries under pressure, sow divisions and exhaust resources. These countries and their allies must quickly come to terms with the fact that they are now on the frontline.\n\nTowards a common victory\n\nNow, of course, we have reached a stage of western unity and solidarity with Ukraine. The response by the transatlantic community to Russia’s invasion was impressive. Putin certainly did not expect such a reaction. A new emboldened sanctions regime has been introduced and Nord Stream 2 has finally been put on hold (yet for how long, we do not know). How this war will end depends on many factors. The brave and courageous Ukrainians defending their home, led and inspired by their democratically elected president, convince us that victory is not only possible but likely. However, peace at any cost cannot be the western-imposed solution to Putin’s war. Ukraine has already sacrificed too much. It has lost too many husbands, wives, sons, daughters and grandparents. Instead, peace can only come with Ukraine’s victory; its territorial integrity intact and its future bright and prosperous.\n\nThe Russian totalitarian regime must be held to account for its crimes in this war. This includes an end to Vladimir Putin’s rule in the Kremlin. A return to business as usual, drunk on Russian disinformation and corrupted by dirty money – to a place where we were before February 24th – is no longer possible. There is only one outcome: Ukraine’s victory and the renewal of the West and its promise of a new future. The price that Ukraine is paying today cannot and will not be made in vain. Understanding this is the first step towards our common victory.\n\nThis text was written by the editors of New Eastern Europe.', 'image': 'https://neweasterneurope.eu/new_site/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/editorial.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:01'}

Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that countries he terms "unfriendly" agree to a scheme under which they would open accounts at Gazprombank and make payments for Russian gas imports in euros or US dollars that would be converted into roubles. Poland is a staunch political opponent of Russia. Polish gas company PGNiG, whose gas deal with Russia expires at the end of this year, has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract. It also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland. Poland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year, and covers about 50 per cent of national consumption. Earlier, data from the European Union network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted but they resumed later on Tuesday. Poland\'s energy supplies were secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said on Tuesday, adding there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut. Gazprom also informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it would halt gas supplies from Wednesday, the energy ministry said. Bulgaria also had a contract due to expire at the end of the year. It meets more than 90 per cent of its gas needs with Gazprom\'s imports about 3 bcm a year. Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at data intelligence firm ICIS, said: "This is a seismic warning shot by Russia." "Poland has had an anti-Russia and anti-Gazprom stance for a number of years, which is not the case for Bulgaria, so to see Bulgaria also be cut off is also quite a development in its own right," he said. Bulgaria said it had taken steps to find alternative gas supply and no restrictions on gas consumption was required for now. Germany\'s network regulator said it was monitoring the gas delivery situation from Russia after the threat to Poland supplies, adding that supply to Germany was currently guaranteed.

Poland and Romania are the first to ask for it.\n\nJames Heappey, UK\'s Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces, told Times Radio that Ukraine had a legal right to strike military facilities on the Russian territory to disrupt the logistics of the Russian Armed Forces.\n\nIt is “completely legitimate for Ukraine to be targeting in Russia’s depth in order to disrupt the logistics that if they weren’t disrupted would directly contribute to death and carnage on Ukrainian soil," Heappey said.\n\nCommenting on this statement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that in order to disrupt military logistics, Russia could strike military targets on the territory of a number of NATO countries that supply arms to the Kiev regime.\n\n"Do we have the right understanding here? After all, it directly leads to deaths and bloodshed on Ukrainian territory. As far as I understand, Britain is one of those countries," Zakharova clarified in her Telegram channel.\n\nEvery time when they sell weapons to Ukraine, European countries fear that they will become a party to military action and "Putin\'s wrath". The head of the German Foreign Office, Annalena Baerbock, expressed her concerns on he matter.\n\n"We at the government are united in saying that we will not become a party to the conflict," she said during a press conference on April 20.\n\nHungary shares a different point of view. Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said during a visit to Kosovo that Hungary had no plans to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine. In addition, Hungary does not allow their transit to Kiev, as they "could become targets to hostile military actions".\n\n"We are not getting involved in this war," the minister explained.\n\nIncidentally, a group of German public figures wrote an open letter to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz calling for arms shipments to Ukraine to end, as this "drags Germany into war".\n\n"By supplying weapons, Germany and other NATO countries have de facto made themselves a party to the war.

In the United States, CNN sources describe arms supplies to Ukraine as an investment in neutralising Russia\'s army and navy for a decade to come. Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin\'s recent statements about his intention to "weaken Russia" through military aid to Ukraine are a cynical reminder of NATO being an aggressive organisation that targets Russia in the first place.\n\nWhere can Russia strike western logistics and military facilities?\n\nThis could be Romania in the first place. Romania may now invade Transnistria to save its Moldovan brothers there.\n\nPoland is next on the list - this country serves as a transit point for all arms shipments from Western countries to Ukraine.\n\nThese countries will not survive a Caliber missile attack either physically or mentally.

It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense.

"Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence. The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing.

Austin said that the US and its allies will "keep moving heaven and Earth" to meet Ukraine\'s security requirements.\n\n"Ukraine needs our help to win today, and they will still need our help when the war is over," Austin said. He added that the US and its allies have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine\'s defense since the start of the war.\n\nThe defense secretary said that Ukraine "has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia\'s unprovoked invasion."\n\nAustin said that Ukraine\'s allies had provided assistance at "record speed," adding that "Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly."\n\nReferring to Russian troop withdrawal from areas around Ukraine\'s capital, Austin said that the war was "entering a new phase" following what he called "Russia\'s defeat at the battle of Kyiv."\n\n"Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man," Austin said, alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens."\n\nWatch video 01:06 Austin: \'We\'re here to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion\'\n\nExplosions hit radio facility in Russia-backed Trans-Dniester\n\nPolice in the breakaway Moldovan region of Trans-Dniester said that two explosions knocked two powerful antennas out of service in a radio facility close to Ukrainian border. The interior ministry of the region said those antennas were re-broadcasting Russian radio.\n\nThe incident occurred in a small town of Maiac about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the regional capital Tiraspol and roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said.\n\nThe explosions come just a day after several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the state security ministry in Tiraspol.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu is convening a meeting of the country\'s Supreme Security Council on Tuesday over incidents that took place in Trans-Dniester.\n\nTrans-Dniester is a narrow strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River, sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova. The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government has come under increasing pressure over not yet sending heavy weapons to Ukraine.\n\nUS kicks off Ukraine conference at Ramstein air base\n\nA defense conference on securing Ukraine\'s long-term security is now underway at the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has invited around 40 countries to the conference. While many NATO members will be present, a number of the countries invited are not NATO member states.\n\nThe attendees will include NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht.\n\nThe meeting seeks to boost weapons deliveries to Ukraine and bolster the country\'s long-term security.\n\nAustin and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday and pledged additional military assistance to Kyiv. Austin and Blinken are expected to brief allies on Ukraine\'s security needs during the conference.\n\nWatch video 02:05 US to host talks on assistance for Ukraine in Germany\n\nNo imminent threat of direct confrontation with Russia — UK armed forces minister\n\nBritish Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said he did not think there was an imminent threat of escalation in the war in Ukraine leading to nuclear conflict.\n\n"What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine. German defense company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann will be given the green light to sell "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks from previous Bundeswehr stocks, dpa reported.\n\nGermany\'s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported that Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht will pledge the anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine during today\'s meeting at the Ramstein US air base.\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Monday following a meeting with Ukrainian officials that Kyiv had requested tanks as it seeks to adapt to the shifting conditions of the conflict.\n\nGermany is reportedly to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft "Gepard" tanks\n\nKreminna in Luhansk region has fallen — UK defense ministry\n\nBritain\'s Defense Ministry said in a Tuesday intelligence update that the town of Kreminna in Ukraine\'s eastern Luhansk region has reportedly fallen to Russian forces.\n\nRussian troops are attempting to advance north to Sloviansk and east to Kramatorsk, according to the ministry.\n\n"Russian forces are likely attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the east of Ukraine," the intelligence update said, adding that Ukrainian forces have been preparing defenses in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nUK drops import tariffs on goods from Ukraine to zero\n\nThe UK has dropped tariffs on all goods coming from Ukraine, following a direct request from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"The UK will continue to do everything in its power to support Ukraine\'s fight against Putin\'s brutal and unprovoked invasion," British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said.\n\nThe average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22%.\n\nThe British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods.\n\nUkraine wants UN to seek Mariupol evacuation\n\nUkraine has urged UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol. Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes. Russia\'s Defense Ministry claimed it used missiles to destroy facilities powering the railways supplying Ukrainian forces with foreign weapons.\n\nAbout 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. Ukraine has claimed 22,000 Russian troops were killed since the invasion. Russia has acknowledged only 1,351 military deaths.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalize parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims.\n\nAfter a visit to Kyiv, Blinken said Russia\'s military was underperforming, and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nWatch video 02:54 Russian missiles strike Ukrainian rail stations\n\nYou can revisit our live updates from April 25 here.\n\nsi, lo, aw/wmr, rs, mhm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61602081_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:19'}

Russia is also proving that energy resources are a weapon. That is why the EU needs to be united and impose an embargo on energy resources, depriving the Russians of their energy weapons.”\n\nThe move will be a grave concern to those countries who are the most heavily dependent on Russian gas, such as Germany, but at a hastily arranged press conference, Polish ministers said they had sufficient supplies to weather an interruption while accusing Gazprom of a breach of contract.\n\nAnna Moskwa, Poland’s minister for climate, said: “There are no worries about shortages of gas in our homes. It is worth pointing out that liquified natural gas alone supplies the market sufficiently. LNG deliveries in [terminal] Świnoujście are growing – in 2015 there was one, in 2021 it was already 35. As of today, it provides for about 50 deliveries.”\n\nShe added: “Appropriate diversification strategies that we have introduced allow us to feel on the safe side in this situation.”\n\nPGNiG, Poland’s largest gas supplier, said it would file a breach of contract lawsuit over Gazprom’s decision.\n\nRussia currently supplies about 55% of Poland’s annual demand of about 21bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas but the country’s government has still been pushing the EU and other western allies to go further in punishing the Kremlin.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Bulgaria’s energy ministry said it had been told that supplies of Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline would also cease on Wednesday.\n\nOnce a close ally of Moscow, Bulgaria has cut many of its ties with Russia, supporting sanctions against Russia and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\nPrime Minister Kiril Petkov and members of his coalition government were due to travel to Kyiv on Wednesday for aid talks with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Balkan country meets more than 90% of its gas needs with Russian imports, but the government insisted that no restrictions would be imposed on domestic gas consumption would be imposed for.\n\nThe NGO Europe Beyond Coal has calculated that the EU has sent more than €41bn (£34.7bn) to Russia in payments for fossil fuels since it invaded Ukraine two months ago.\n\nPoland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, had already said he intended to ban Russian gas and oil imports by the end of the year and there has been a move to diversify to cover for losses.\n\nThe key Yamal pipeline carries natural gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, through Belarus. But the Polish government had made a clear move away from dependency by constructing a liquefied natural gas terminal in the Baltic port of Świnoujście, run by Qatari and US companies, which is capable of handling 5 bcm of gas. It is being expanded to 7.5 bcm by 2023.\n\nThe extent to which Polish industry will be able to rely on this flow is yet to be seen, however, and other countries will be worried about the development.\n\nMoscow had warned clients in March that they risked having their gas supplies cut unless they paid in roubles.\n\nThe European Commission had nevertheless said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars.\n\nThe only EU leader who has suggested he would pay Gazprom in roubles is Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, whose rightwing government has pursued a close relationship with Putin’s regime for over a decade.\n\nThe move by the Kremlin comes as EU member states are drawing up a sixth wave of sanctions that could include imposing a ceiling on the price paid for Russian oil.\n\nBut there remains a reluctance in Berlin, in particular, to go hard on gas imports given the German economy’s dependence on Russia in that field.\n\nIn early April, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told the Bundestag that the country’s energy reliance had “grown over decades and cannot be ended from one day to the next”, given that it would lead to the rationing of energy to industry and the potential closure of its largest factories.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gazprom denied that gas flows to Poland had been stopped.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war.

It meets over 90% of its gas needs with Gazprom\'s imports at around 3 bcm a year. read more\n\nTom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at data intelligence firm ICIS, said: "This is a seismic warning shot by Russia."\n\n"Poland has had an anti-Russia and anti-Gazprom stance for a number of years, which is not the case for Bulgaria, so to see Bulgaria also be cut off is also quite a development in its own right," he added.\n\nPoland said it can source gas via two links with Germany including a reverse flow on the Yamal pipeline, a link with Lithuania with an annual capacity of 2.5 bcm that will open on May 1 and via an interconnector with the Czech Republic for up to 1.5 bcm.\n\nAnother 5-6 bcm could be shipped via a link with Slovakia to be opened later this year.\n\nIn addition, PGNiG can import up to 6 bcm per year via the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea, and it produces more than 3 bcm of gas per year locally in Poland. In October, a pipeline allowing up to 10 bcm of gas per year to flow between Poland and Norway, will be opened.\n\nGovernment officials said Poland\'s gas storage of 3.5 bcm is 76% full and it will not have to cut supplies to customers to cope with Gazprom supply halt.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria said it has taken steps to find alternative gas supply and no restrictions on gas consumption was required for now.\n\nAnalysts at investment bank Jefferies said the cut-off warning increases the risk of other early terminations for other European contracts due to expire by the year end, amounting to nearly 12 bcm a year.\n\nOnly a few Russian gas buyers, such as Hungary and Uniper (UN01.DE), Germany\'s main importer of Russian gas, have said it would be possible to pay for future supplies under the scheme announced by Moscow without breaching European Union sanctions.\n\nGermany\'s network regulator said it was monitoring the gas delivery situation from Russia after the threat to Poland supplies, adding that supply to Germany was currently guaranteed. read more\n\nPGNiG said on Tuesday it would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas according to the Yamal contract and that any halt of supplies was a breach of that contract, adding that it has the right to pursue damages over breach of contract.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Poland announced a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, that would be subject to sanctions under a law passed earlier this month allowing their assets to be frozen. The law is separate fromsanctions imposed jointly by EU countries.\n\nGas traders said the Dutch gas market, the European benchmark, moved up near the end of trade on Tuesday. The front-month Dutch gas contract settled around 5.4% higher at 98.20 euros/MWh.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Alan Charlish, Joanna Plucinska, Marek Strzelecki, Marwa Rashad, Nora Buli, Christoph Steitz, Tsvetelia Tsolova, Stephen Jewkes; writing by Nina Chestney in London; Editing by Rosalba O\'Brien and Marguerita Choy\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.', 'image': 'https://www.reuters.com/resizer/skIhvxskF6CUkD3Hx81Sh5yFNXw=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QKHGQ3235JO2PKDZKLZT47Y5PA.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:55'}

Unsurprisingly, many of these efforts have often been penetrated due to the poor and blatant construction exposed by the mainstream Western mass media that perhaps interact closely with the intelligence circles.\n\nBut this hardly means that Western governments and the mass media are bona fide disseminators of war information that is free from distortion and manipulation. This is because, in the modern and contemporary history of war, government propaganda is a commonplace. It is instrumental to mobilize, sustain and strengthen domestic and international support for war efforts, particularly when magnified by mass media. An underdog country can use such propaganda to enhance international support, especially through provision of weapons, ammunition, logistics and, if feasible, reinforcements, to complement its inferior war capability, as well as economic sanction against the top dog country. On the other hand, the latter can employ such a propaganda to enhance popular morale and supplement resource mobilization capacity.\n\nIn fact, Western government war propaganda and the mainstream mass media reports have established a predominant international opinion that sides sympathetically with Ukraine as the innocent underdog[i]. This is particularly because numerous video footage has lively covered massive exoduses of Ukrainian women and children to neighboring countries, missile bombardment and other forms of shelling against urban residential areas, and vivid images of killed and injured noncombatants as well as combatants, among others. Unfortunately, timely open-source information on evolving operational and tactical realities is limited, partial, unbalanced and/or, biased, possibly with intentional distortions and manipulations. Yet, the reports seem to prove atrocities committed by the Russian invasion forces, demonizing these forces and President Vladimir Putin at the levels of jus ad bellum and jus in bello.\n\nYet, war propaganda becomes unplausible and ineffective, especially when detached from evolving battlefield realities. Until then, war propaganda surely hampers coolheaded analysis and appropriate policy prescription on how to end a war, while unnecessarily protracting warfare involving a significantly higher death toll and further destruction.\n\nIn this light, this study will cast some different light on the tenability of the predominant factual recognition and discourse in mainstream Western mass media. The first jus in bello cases are about Western allegation of atrocities committed by the Russian side against Ukrainian non-combatants, particularly under the condition of extremely fierce urban warfare in the cities of Mariupol and Bucha. The second jus ad bellum case is about Russian allegation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine. These cases are particularly important because most of Western news and reports have flatly turned down Russian counterparts as misinformation and disinformation, without any serious examination. Certainly, the current author of this piece does not enjoy any privileged access to classified information but only to open sources. Yet, careful examination of open-source materials, including Russian and alternative media sources, may make it possible to identify blind assumptions and invalid judgements in the current dominant Western discourse, if not to present correct facts and cogent judgements.\n\n1. The Mariupol Case\n\n1) The Context\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky stated in his on-line speech of March 23 to the Japanese Diet that several thousand Ukrainian civilians, including 121 children, had been killed, together with nine millions refugees and internally displaced civilians[ii]. This unexpectedly low level of death toll may indicate that Russian invasion forces exercised certain self-restraint in attacking civilians, except collateral damage.\n\nIn fact, Douglas Macgregor[iii], a retired U.S. Army Colonel and a Senior Advisor to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, stated that, despite the strong impression generated by the repeated exposure to video footage, President Putin strictly ordered from the outset of the war to avoid killing civilians and destroying urban areas as much as possible[iv]. This is consistent with his historical outlook on the triune Russian national identity – White, Little and Great Russians (respectively, Belarussians, Ukrainians and Russians), characterized by strong historical unity and brotherhood[v]. Naturally ,it begs the question of why the Russian forces killed many Ukrainian civilians and severely destroyed urban residential areas in Ukraine, involving an inscrutable disjunction between Putin’s own creed and practice.\n\nExtremely fierce urban warfare, especially in the City of Mariupol, is a natural consequence of the stark disparity of Russian and Ukrainian military power, to which both sides have even introduced foreign volunteer fighters and mercenaries[vi]. With its overwhelming superiority, the Russian invasion forces neutralized a significant portion of main high-end platforms, assets and on-ground facilities of the Ukrainian armed forces at the initial stage of the current war, including air superiority fighters, major battle tanks and the command & control systems[vii]. This is consistent with numerous video footage available in public domain that primarily captures Ukrainian infantry operations with portable anti-tank missiles for close combat and low-altitude anti-air missiles, while few high-end platforms are visible. In fact, the Russian Defense Ministry said that, soon after the start of the war, the Russian forces totally destroyed Ukrainian Air Force combat aircraft while some of them escaped to Poland and Romania[viii]. Reportedly, the Russia forces destroyed 974 Ukrainian tanks and other armored vehicles just for the first three weeks[ix]. No wonder, MacGregor judged that the Ukrainian units still active “(were) completely surrounded, cut off and isolated in various town and cities”, with supplies likely running out soon[x]. Ukrainian infantry and special operation forces in Mariupol were cornered at bay without reinforcement nor air cover. An Azov Battalion commander there vainly urged the U.S.-led NATO to make armed intervention against Russia, especially to set an effective no-fly zone over Ukraine, while attributing a grave humanitarian crisis in the making to Russia。[xi]\n\n2) Who attacked the maternity hospital and the drama theater?\n\nThe Ukrainian government strongly condemned Russia for its military attack against a maternity hospital in Mariupol on March 17[xii], which injured 17 people including women, children and doctors, with at least five of them dead thereafter[xiii]. But Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov justified the attack because an Azov Battalion unit turned the hospital to a combat base[xiv], claiming the victims as unavoidable and lawful collateral damage. Surprisingly, the pregnant woman on spotlight in the reports later disclosed that Ukrainian soldiers used the hospital as base while holding these civilians as human shield against Russian forces, suggesting that the incident was an act of self-destruct and a false flag operation by the Ukraine’s side[xv]. This is compatible with other fragmentary video footage that capture how Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol have been used as human shield[xvi] and prevented from leaving the city[xvii].\n\nAlso, the Ukrainian government alleged, echoed aloud by major Western mass media, that, on March 16, a Russian airstrike dropped a powerful bomb on the Mariupol Drama Theater sheltering some 1,300 local residents, including women and children, and despite large signs of “children” that were clearly visible from aircraft. Reportedly, the death toll reached at least to 300[xviii]. The Russian government flatly denied the allegation and instead accused the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, of blowing up the theater building. This is compatible with the interview of a 17- year-old female survivor of the incident with the Abkhazian Network News Agency, who eye-witnessed Azov soldiers hiding themselves behind civilian hostages in the building[xix].\n\nMore specifically, a Russian military spokesman stated that Azov Battalion units held civilian hostages in the theater building as human shield, using the upper floor as firing points. This means that the Russian attack aimed at these units, involving significant civilian casualties as collateral damage during the engagement[xx]. This is a plausible account on what happened, particularly given the very similar circumstances of the above hospital case.\n\nIt is now crucially important to inquire what the Azov Battalion is all about and if the troop has the established notoriety of committing such atrocities.\n\n3）The Azov Battalion[xxi]\n\nThe Azov Battalion is now a part of the Ukrainian National Guard, which is the country’s gendarmerie under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Its name originates from the fact that it has been based in Mariupol in the Azov Sea costal region since 2014, first as a volunteer militia that fought against Russian separatist forces in the Donbas War and later in the same year incorporated into the National Guard while expanded in scale into a regiment. As Russia labels it as neo-Nazis, it in fact uses controversial symbols resembling the Nazis SS Wolfsangel, though it denies any connection with Nazism[xxii]. Yet, in 2015, an Azov spokesman disclosed 10-20% of units consisted of neo-Nazis members[xxiii]. The concern over the Azov is serious enough to the extent that the U.S. Congress enacted a legislative measure, Consolidated Appropriation Bill of 2018, to ban military aids to the paramilitary due to its white supremacist ideology and neo-Nazism[xxiv].\n\nThe Azov has faced serious allegations of committing torture and war crimes, including the grossly underinvestigated case of the 2014 Odessa Clashes in which some 50 pro-Russia separatists were killed[xxv]. In fact, the U.N. Human Rights Office of High Commissioner published reports that connect the Azov Battalion to war crimes such as mass looting, unlawful detention, and torture[xxvi]. Clearly. Russia’s counter-allegations on the above atrocities in Mariupol are at least compatible with an established understanding on Azov’s behavioral pattern connected to war crimes.\n\nActually, Russia’s emphasis and Western de-emphasis on the Azov Battalion is obscurely central to their intensified exchanges of war propaganda and counter-propaganda, on the ground that the paramilitary has constituted a major U.S instrument of covert military intervention in Russia-Ukraine armed conflict. More specifically, the CIA had a secret advisory and training program for Ukrainian paramilitaries and militias, most probably including the Azov, for eight years until shortly before the start of the current war, despite the aforementioned legislative ban. The CIA has had training centers in the U.S. and eastern Ukraine for sniper techniques[xxvii], anti-tank missile handling, covert communications, and other tactics necessary for insurgency and counter-insurgency[xxviii]. Thus, the issue of the Azov Battalion cannot simply be reduced to the question of war crimes, but can only be fully comprehended in the context of a U.S.-Russia proxy war over the Donbas region that is central to NATO expansion to Ukraine and determination of their spheres of interest.\n\n2. The Bucha Case\n\nA similar suspicion of war propaganda is not easily excludable, with a focus on the atrocities allegedly committed by the Russian armed forces against local Ukrainian civilians in the city of Bucha. Major Western governments and the mainstream mass media are condemning, with strongest terms, the unspeakable atrocities against local Ukrainian civilians on the way of retreat after hard battles to vainly capture Kiev. However, on March 31 when the Russian forces left the city, its mayor did not at all mention of the atrocities in an interview with a Ukrainian on-line news site[xxix] which is compatible with his bright expression in a selfie video taken on the same day[xxx]. On April 2, when Ukrainian army forces entered the city to make sure of a complete retreat of the Russian forces, the video footage by a local news media captured no corpse on roads and no sign of emotional distress among the local population. On April 1, Azov Battalion troops entered the city[xxxi], and on April 3, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense released video footage as evidence of the atrocities committed by the Russian forces, which neither the New York Times nor the Pentagon are independently able to verify the assertion of the Ministry[xxxii]. In addition, in the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. and the U.K. blocked Russia’s proposal to send an independent fact-finding mission to Ukraine[xxxiii].\n\nThus, there is a good possibility that the Azov Battalion might have fabricated or purposefully committed at least some parts of the “atrocities” by itself[xxxiv]. (More specifically, to differentiate which camp they belong, pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian civilians wear blue or white armbands respectively. Many corpses in Bucha wore white armbands as in video footage available. The Azov and/or other ultra-right militia units may have committed the atrocities out of emotional impulse, while the mass media and propaganda section of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs may have made up the scene to impute responsibilities of war crime to the Russian invasion forces[xxxv]. It should be reminded that the current war has the dimension of ethnic conflict as well as that of inter-state war.)\n\nGiven the leading role of BBC reports on this matter with the analysis of a satellite image, this begs the question of if the U.K. intelligence circles are engaged in elaborate war propaganda against Russia to mislead and manipulate other major Western governments and mass media[xxxvi].\n\n3. The Case of Biological Weapon R&D\n\nPossession of weapon of mass destruction by a revisionist power may constitute a casus belli of a status quo power, particularly when the latter sees the former’s move as its existential threat or serious threat against its vital national interests. Yet, legitimatizing a war has to satisfy some procedural requirements according to international law with presentation of solid evidence to the international society.\n\nIn this light, Russia’s allegation on Ukraine’s nuclear weapon programs is not tenable at all, at least at this point, due to its abrupt aggression against Ukraine without presenting any substantial evidence[xxxvii]. Also, there are little significant related information in public domain, though Ukraine has active nuclear power plants with some substantial potential to develop nuclear weapons as the country was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nBut Russia’s accusation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine, as articulated with a trove of original documentation by Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, Commander of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troop of the Russian Army[xxxviii], is not totally deniable but seems plausible with open-source information[xxxix]. Most remarkably, Victoria Nuland, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, admitted the existence of biolaboratories in Ukraine under the bilateral cooperative programs of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency during a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations[xl], while the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department unequivocally denied U.S.-funded biological weapon laboratories in Ukraine[xli]. In addition, an official letter from an official in charge at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to a project manager of Black & Veatch, a DTRA contractor, attests to their significant collaborative research relationship, while another official letter from an official in charge at the DTRA office in Kiev to an official in charge at the Ukraine Ministry Defense indicates their clear awareness of the potential usefulness of their research collaboration for biological weapon development[xlii].\n\nCertainly, the Agency’s Biological Threat Reduction Programs may serve bona fide statutory purposes, not designed to contribute to virus and other biological weapon R&D. Yet, suspicion remains, given that the offense and defense of biological warfare is generally the head and tail of similar biological weapon technologies while there is no clear demarcation line between military and civil research in most advanced virus and other biological R&D that involves genetic manipulation. The lack of confidence in the sectoral culture has recently become worse because Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the President Biden, hid the fact before a Senate hearing that the EcoHealth Alliance, New York City-based nonprofit organization, funneled U.S. public funds to gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses at China’s Wuhan lab, making it feasible to bypass stringent domestic regulations and strict public eyes. The experiment is suspected potentially useful for biological weapon R&D, and a virus leak from the lab might have been a primary cause of the current COVIT-19 pandemic[xliii].\n\n4. Reflection\n\nHitherto, this investigative inquiry has cast significant doubt and suspicion on the established Western discourse that sided uncritically with Ukraine in its war against hyper-demonized Russia, almost exclusively on the basis of Western government war information and mass media reports, and without carefully checking Russian reports.\n\nOf course, Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine is utterly indisputable, and a great number of innocent Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the current war, either in atrocity or collateral damage. But who killed how many civilians and in what ways is not self-evident as reported in the Western media, especially in the context of ethnic conflict and urban warfare as the world learnt from gross information manipulation in the former Yugoslavia ethnic conflict[xliv]. It is increasingly necessary to check Western reports carefully against Russian ones, while verifying the authenticity of allegedly “original” U.S. documents presented by the Russian government and mass media. The U.S. government will be accountable, if verified.\n\nInundated with propaganda and counter-propaganda both by the West and Russia day after day, both political leaders and the public in the West will suffer self-poisoning effect of the hyper-demonized image of Russia on making coolheaded policy analysis. It is high time that the Western governments and mainstream mass media recalibrate war propaganda and counter-propaganda, in view of the need to think of how to end the current war and to keep diplomatic channels open with Russia that would most unlikely capitulate, given that it is a nuclear power coequal to the United States.\n\n[i] Despite the current image of an innocent victim, Ukraine has continually played a disturbing role to Asian and international security, particularly because it sold an ex-Soviet aircraft career, Varyag, as scrap to China, that has been already repaired and commissioned as the country’s first aircraft career, Liaoning; and because Ukraine has not effectively banned outflows of ballistic missile technologies to North Korea that has significantly contributed to the development of its nuclear weapon programs.

EU countries have largely refused that demand, saying it breaks contracts denominated in dollars and euros.\n\nThe European Commission said that such payments would violate EU sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nPGNiG said it continued "to settle its liabilities for natural gas delivered under the Yamal Contract in accordance with its current terms."\n\nThe Polish utility demanded that Gazprom resume gas deliveries. If that doesn\'t happen, it warned: "the Company reserves the right to claim damages."\n\n"There is no contractual basis for the suspension of the supply of the gas delivered under the Yamal Contract," PGNiG said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Gazprom spokesperson Sergey Kupriyanov told reporters in Moscow: "Poland is obliged to pay for gas supplies in accordance with the new payment procedure," according to the official TASS news agency.\n\nBulgaria also balked at the demand to pay in rubles. The new Russian payment system is "at odds with the agreement that is effective until the end of this year and poses considerable risks for the Bulgarian side," said the energy ministry.\n\nPoland has vowed to end imports of Russian coal, gas and oil, and is pressing other EU countries to rapidly do the same.\n\n"We are prepared for the complete cut off of Russian fossil fuels," Polish Energy Minister Anna Moskwa said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nPoland gets 46 percent of its gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia, according to Forum Energii, a think tank.\n\nPolish authorities insisted that the cutoff won\'t affect gas users.\n\n"Thanks to the implementation of the government\'s strategy of diversifying gas supply sources, PGNiG is prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on the western and southern borders and the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście," said PGNiG.\n\nMoskwa said: "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security," adding that the country\'s gas storage was 80 percent full. She said Poland will continue to buy gas on European and international markets and aims to fill its reserves to 100 percent.\n\nBulgaria, which gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia, said it has "taken steps to ensure alternative supplies of natural gas and handle the situation.

Schwedt, which is run by Russia\'s state-owned Rosneft, supplies the vast majority of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region with fuel.\n\nA lack of oil infrastructure linking the former West and East Germany means the country\'s eastern states would have been hit especially hard by an import stop — but a solution is close at hand, Habeck said.\n\nDealing with Schwedt "is the last task that still stands in the way of completely securing the energy supply. I can already say that an [oil] embargo has become manageable for Germany."\n\nHabeck was in Warsaw to work out if oil refineries in eastern Germany could in part be supplied with shipments via the Polish port of Gdańsk, and he said the two countries were working together on the issue.\n\nThe trouble with Schwedt, he said, was its majority owner.\n\n"Rosneft\'s business model is to buy Russian oil, and that is exactly the bone of contention: If we don\'t want Russian oil anymore we need an alternative for Schwedt," he said. "To develop this is the task of the next days — and yes, I hope only days."\n\nAs for Germany\'s remaining fossil fuel dependence on Russia, he said Berlin was on track to finding alternative coal supply to comply with the EU\'s embargo; the bloc decided earlier this month to end Russian coal purchases by August.\n\nThe issue of natural gas, he acknowledged, would not be solved as quickly. The share of Russian imports is now at 40 percent, down from 55 percent before the war.

But Johnson insisted that the West did not need to make concessions despite the nuclear threat.\n\n“People say we have to make a concession, we have to worry about what Putin might do because of the risk of his defeat,” Johnson said. “I think he has got a lot of space, he has got a lot of room for manoeuvre.”\n\n10:02pm: Gazprom has informed Bulgaria, Poland of halt to gas supplies from Wednesday\n\nRussia’s Gazprom has informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it will halt gas supplies as of Wednesday, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ministry said that along with state gas companies it has taken steps to find alternative arrangements for the supply of natural gas and to deal with the situation.\n\nIt said for the time being no restrictions in the gas consumption in the Balkan country which meets over 90 percent of its gas needs with Gazprom’s imports, were required.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Polish officials had said Russia is suspending natural gas deliveries to Poland beginning Wednesday morning after that country refused a demand to pay for its supplies in Russian rubles\n\nPoland’s state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Russian gas giant Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop on Wednesday.\n\nPolish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources. She said the country has been effectively independent when it comes to Russian gas for some time.\n\n“There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes,” Moskwa tweeted.\n\n9:39pm IAEA says it has agreed with Ukraine to help repair damage to Chernobyl\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday said he had agreed with Ukraine to help repair the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant after it was occupied by Russian troops.\n\n“It is visible that there is damage and we are assessing that,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told a news conference in Kyiv after visiting the station.\n\nThirty-six years ago, on April 26, 1986, an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction destroyed the reactor in an accident that was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities.\n\nRussian troops took over the site on February 24 of this year, the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, taking Ukrainian soldiers prisoner and detaining civilian staff.\n\nThe occupation lasted until the end of March and raised global fears of nuclear leaks.\n\nRussia’s temporary takeover of the Chernobyl site was “very, very dangerous” and raised radiation levels but they have now returned to “normal”, Grossi said during his visit there earlier on Tuesday.\n\n9:17pm: US warns not to \'escalate tensions\' after Moldova region blasts\n\nThe United States on Tuesday warned against attempts to "escalate tensions" after a series of blasts in a Russian-backed separatist region of Moldova, which borders Ukraine.\n\nWhile stopping short of backing Kyiv\'s contention that Russia was responsible for the incidents in Transnistria, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters: "We do remain concerned about any potential attempts to escalate tensions."\n\n"We reiterate the Moldovan government\'s call for calm in response to these incidents and we fully support Moldova\'s territorial integrity and sovereignty," Price said.\n\nThe mysterious recent blasts which targeted the state security ministry, a radio tower and military unit came days after a senior Russian commander claimed Russian speakers in Moldova were being oppressed.\n\nRussian forces have been positioned in Transnistria for three decades after the predominantly Russian-speaking region seceded from the former Soviet republic, a decision not recognized internationally.\n\n9:04pm: US says talk of Lavrov\'s comments on nuclear escalation is irresponsible\n\nThe US State Department on Tuesday criticized Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s comments about the potential of a nuclear war, saying loose talk about nuclear escalation was the "height of irresponsibility."\n\nLavrov warned the West on Monday not to underestimate the elevated risks of nuclear conflict over Ukraine and said he viewed NATO as being "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia by supplying Kyiv with weaponry.\n\n8:10pm: Putin agrees to United Nations, Red Cross help to evacuate civilians from Azovstal plant, UN says\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin agreed “in principle” to UN and International Committee for the Red Cross involvement in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in Ukraine’s Mariupol, the United Nations said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n“Follow-on discussions will be had with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Russian Defence Ministry,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement after Putin met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Moscow.\n\n7:44pm: Putin tells UN chief he still has \'hope\' for Ukraine talks\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told the visiting UN chief Tuesday that he still had hope for negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track.

"We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nPutin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia\'s military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.\n\nGuterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (see 2:02pm, below) for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\n6:45pm: Blinken says Putin not \'serious\' about Ukraine diplomacy\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the Ukraine war, despite a series of international efforts.\n\n“We’ve seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: “Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table.”\n\nBlinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlinken hailed what he saw on the trip and said that the US was speeding up arms deliveries, with the process now often taking only 72 hours after Ukraine sends requests.\n\n6:10pm: Germany confirms plans to send Ukraine tanks, in policy shift\n\nGermany said Tuesday it would send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a clear switch in Berlin’s cautious policy on military backing for Kyiv that was welcomed by the United States.\n\nThe government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the US Ramstein airbase.\n\nThe move comes after heavy criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to Ukraine, despite announcing a “turning point” in German defence policy in response to Russia’s invasion.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the pledge to send “some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems”, the English name for the weapons, was “especially welcome”.\n\n5:19pm: US Defence Secretary says US, allies to meet monthly on arming Ukraine\n\nThe United States and its allies will meet once a month to discuss Ukraine\'s defence needs to battle invading Russian troops, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.\n\n"Today\'s gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine\'s self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\n4:53pm: FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg on the fallout over blasts in Transnistria, Moldova\n\n02:48 © FRANCE 24\n\n4:08pm: Putin, Erdogan discuss humanitarian corridors in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow’s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin statement, the leaders in a phone call talked about “efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors”.\n\nThis came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.\n\nThe Kremlin said Erdogan asked Putin about the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe Russian leader told him that “the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there”.\n\n3:09pm: Nearly 5.3 million flee Ukraine war as refugees, up more than 32,000 since Monday\n\nNearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.\n\nIn total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 32,753 over Monday\'s figure.\n\nWhile the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday (see 11:31am, below) that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.\n\n2:02 pm: Guterres says Russia, UN have \'very different\' views of events in Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had "very frank" discussions with Lavrov. He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Le Drian “reiterated France\'s request for the free movement of civilians and free access for humanitarian aid in Mariupol, as in the rest of Ukraine”, the statement noted.\n\nFrance is delivering Caesar cannons with a range of 40 kilometres (25 miles) to Ukraine and is among 40 countries attending the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group meeting hosted by the US at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nJ’ai souhaité confirmer à mon homologue ukrainien @DmytroKuleba que la France maintiendrait son appui déterminé à l’Ukraine face à la guerre à laquelle elle est confrontée : assistance financière, sanctions, équipements de défense, lutte contre l’impunité. pic.twitter.com/9OgtKltUar — Jean-Yves Le Drian (@JY_LeDrian) April 26, 2022\n\n10:32 am: ‘Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine’: US defence chief Austin\n\nOpening the gathering of representatives of more than 40 countries at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called on members of the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group to arrive at “a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to move heaven and earth so that we can meet them”.\n\nAustin, who is chairing the meeting at the US air base, said Kyiv had done “an impressive job defending its sovereignty against Russia’s unprovoked invasion”, adding: "“Ukraine’s valor and skill will go down in military history.”\n\n“Ukraine has now beaten back the Russian military for 62 days. Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and REUTERS)\n\n© Studio graphique France Médias Monde\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/e48d305a-c59a-11ec-898c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/20220426-gazprom-m.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:50'}

In Borodyanka, near Kyiv — in the midst of the destruction and devastation — I and the presidents of the other Baltic states and Poland stood and stared at the ghastly face of war. I thought of my own children and grandchildren, and I was overwhelmed by sadness and grief.\n\nAs Europe, we failed. We failed because we were unable to dissuade Russian President Vladimir Putin from starting his war. And every town and village Russia now takes in Ukraine is part of our failure. Every Ukrainian hurt, killed or deported from their home adds to our failure, as do the millions of Ukrainian war refugees in every European country.\n\nIt is important that we start helping Ukraine more effectively, more visibly and more boldly. Russia’s goal is to destroy the existing Ukrainian state; our goal is to prevent that from happening. The time has come for us to shake off our fear and start making courageous decisions.\n\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter states that a U.N. member has the inherent right to individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against it. I emphasize the word “collective” because it underscores a very important point: Ukraine has the right to defend itself, and the rest of us, for whom the charter is an essential cornerstone of international relations, have a duty to help. This is what the collective self-defense of Ukraine means.\n\nWe must do everything we can to ensure Ukraine’s strong military resistance and the sanctions isolating Russia make the cost of the war so high for Moscow that it is eventually forced to back down.\n\nEconomic sanctions must be strong and effective, without exception, and for immediate implementation. This means some inconvenience for us, but just look at the footage of Ukrainian towns and villages after the departure of the Russian army. When we look into the face of Putin’s war, we realize that the inconveniences we experience under the umbrella of the European Union and NATO are nothing compared to the suffering of Ukrainians.\n\nIt’s time to embrace debates that involve thinking outside the box. We need an oil embargo, and we need it now. By paying Russia for energy, we continue to finance its war. Let us not forget that 60 percent of Russia’s oil exports are to Europe, and that last year, the Kremlin earned €180 billion from the sale of crude oil and petroleum products.\n\nAs for gas, Estonia has made a proposal to the EU, which is being referred to as “escrow”: Part of the payment for gas will be made directly to Russia, while the other part will be transferred to a separate account, frozen for Ukraine, which will be able to use it in the future to rebuild its destroyed nation. Gas cannot be put back into the ground, so there is no reason to fear that we will receive no gas if we implement this proposal.\n\nThe head of the U.N. World Food Programme, David Beasley, has also warned us that the war in Ukraine will lead to the worst food crisis since World War II — and World Bank President David Malpass acknowledged this. As such, we must discuss whether and how, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the U.N. Charter, we could provide direct support, upon the invitation of the Ukrainian government, to keep the port of Odesa open for Ukrainian grain ships.\n\nUkrainians say they have 20 million metric tons of grain in storage silos — probably 50 million with this year’s harvest — and if it remains in storage, there will be no sowing in the coming years. It is not possible to transport this quantity to the world market by rail — there is simply too much of it.\n\nWestern countries should establish a military presence in part of the Black Sea to ensure the safe movement of commercial and humanitarian aid vessels. Surely, some will argue against this and say that no one would take such a risk. But in the end, it is a question of our willingness to meet humanitarian needs. And where there is a will, there is a way.\n\nUkraine also needs weapons to defend itself, both those that its military knows how to use and more modern, effective weaponry that requires rapid training. We can offer them this training. As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its next phase, we should work more on the planning and coordination of military aid, helping to ensure that Ukraine’s most critical needs are met. This would truly be an effective signal of our unity.\n\nThe war in Europe affects us all; no one can ignore it. To do so would be to betray Europe. And only effective sanctions and Ukraine’s continued courage will eventually bring us to a point where Russia starts discussing a ceasefire in a meaningful and serious way. Only then will peace finally be possible.\n\nBut our goal must be a peace to which Ukrainians agree. We are not pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to give in, pushing the idea that a bad peace is still better than war. We will not accept a peace that Ukraine is forced to settle for because it has missiles pointed at it.\n\n“This war will only be won by Ukraine,” wrote Eero Epner, a well-known Estonian director and journalist, who visited Kyiv alongside myself and my fellow Polish and Baltic presidents. “But if it is lost, Ukraine will not be the one that loses it: we will be the ones who lose it.”\n\nWe cannot — we must not — lose.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25/GettyImages-1240213966-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:21'}

Belarus lost about a third of its population, Poland and Ukraine a little under a fifth, and Jews, who lived in all three countries, were subjected to almost complete annihilation in the Holocaust.\n\nBy that grim comparison, Russia actually remained largely untouched — a Russia War indeed.\n\nThe current war on Ukraine has only reinforced Russia\'s dismissive attitudes toward Poles, Belarusians, and Ukrainians.\n\nFor Moscow, the Poles are "chronic Russo-phobes," Belarusians are unreliable allies, and Ukrainians must be destroyed.\n\nThe war has also begun to change German perceptions, most notably with respect to Ukrainians. Berlin has condemned the Russian aggression, adopted severe sanctions, mothballed the Nord Stream II pipeline, and supplied Ukraine with arms.\n\nBut old habits die hard — former German chancellor Angela Merkel still refuses to admit that her policies toward Russia enabled Putin.\n\nFormer chancellor Gerhard Schröder remains an unrepentant Putin apologist and a tacit supporter of Putin\'s genocide in Ukraine.\n\nDüsseldorf\'s ex-mayor, Thomas Geisel, a social democrat like Schröder, openly questions whether Russian atrocities in Ukraine are really as serious as Ukrainians say they are, while a group of left-wingers is calling on the German government to stop delivering arms to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to German analyst Constanze Stelzenmueller: "Germany\'s self-serving Russia policy and its self-inflicted energy dependence — part wilfully naive, part deeply corrupt — found eager supporters across the political party spectrum. They emboldened the Kremlin, and they enabled Vladimir Putin\'s war."\n\nThe fact is that, just as Russia\'s distaste for its eastern neighbours includes pretty much the whole spectrum of relevant political elites, so, too, Germany\'s prioritising of Russia still remains the default position of its establishment.\n\nSo, when German finance minister Christian Lindner said on 23 April that "we must do everything in our power to help Ukraine win, but the limit of the ethical responsibility is endangering our own security and endangering the defence capability of Nato territory," one appreciates his concern for Ukraine, but one also notes that he all but openly says Germany\'s security is not dependent on Ukraine, while it is dependent on Russia.\n\nGreat power games\n\nWhy do Germany and Russia think so much alike about their neighbours in between?\n\nThe answer may lie in history and in geopolitics: both countries have been great powers since the mid-18th century and their "natural" field of contention and cooperation has been eastern Europe. It stands to reason that their mental maps of the region would be similar.\n\nUnsurprisingly, eastern Europeans often view their relationship with Germany and Russia as similar to being trapped between a hammer and an anvil.\n\nAnd with good reason — modern history is full of examples of Russo-German conflict and cooperation resulting in death and destruction for the countries in between.\n\nRussia and Prussia (the forerunner of modern Germany) colluded in three partitions of Poland in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nWilhelmine Germany and Tsarist Russia were on opposing sides in World War I, and most of the warfare took place in today\'s Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland.\n\nIn 1922, Soviet Russia and Weimar Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo, thereby recognising each other diplomatically and opening the door to economic and military cooperation that enabled Germany to rearm. The losers were, once again, the newly independent states of eastern Europe.\n\nRusso-German relations temporarily worsened after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, but collaboration resumed after a Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in 1939, resulting in the fourth Polish partition and Russian aggression against the Baltic states.\n\nTwo years later, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and, as during the previous world war, the death and destruction were centred on the peoples of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine.\n\nPost-war Germany\'s policy of Ostpolitik led to a normalisation of relations with the Communist regimes of the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany, but eastern European democratic dissidents paid the price.\n\nFormer German chancellor Willy Brandt urged the Solidarność trade union movement in Poland to stop striking in 1980, and then, in 1985, while on an official state visit, purposely refrained from meeting with Solidarność activists, clearly signalling who Bonn\'s preferred interlocutors were and where Germany\'s interests supposedly lay.\n\nThe revolutions of 1989, Germany\'s reunification in 1990, and the Soviet Union\'s collapse in 1991 paved the way for the pro-Russian and pro-Putin policies that helped make Europe dependent on Russian gas, demonised Ukraine as irredeemably corrupt, and ignored the telltale signs of Putin\'s openly aggressive stance toward Russia\'s neighbours.\n\nGermany\'s neglect of its eastern neighbours and Russia\'s hostility to them facilitated the ongoing genocidal war.\n\nNo more great powers\n\nInasmuch as eastern Europeans have suffered both when Germany and Russia have fought and when they have cooperated, the solution to this problem has to be geopolitical.\n\nIn the short run, that means Ukraine\'s victory over Russia.\n\nIn the long run, Germany must remain a middle power and Russia must be denied great-power status. De-Putinizing the regime will help, but the only durable solution for peace is for Russia to break apart.', 'image': 'https://media.euobserver.com/771665bd9becd54a78aff46c75478260-800x.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:09'}

"And now at 90 years old, I have to experience another war," she added as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier leaned toward her.\n\nNeyman is from the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, or Dnipro. Now in emergency accommodation on the eastern outskirts of Berlin, she described to the German head of state how, during World War II, her mother fled with her to the North Caucasus region and then, as the Nazi army advanced, to Kazakhstan: "We tried to survive somehow."\n\nThe hail of bombs\n\nAnother survivor is Svetlana Sabudkina, a little younger than Neyman, who was born in Kyiv. She recalled how she "got caught in the hail of bombs" as a child with her Jewish mother in the city of Kharkiv and then survived in the Ural Mountains, where "a kind-hearted Russian woman took us in."\n\nSabundkina also remembers postwar Kyiv, when German soldiers, prisoners of war, helped to rebuild the destroyed city. She shared her school lunch with one of them: "I felt sorry for him."\n\nGermany\'s Steinmeier told the group of six Holocaust survivors, who escaped Ukraine to Germany despite their advanced ages, "It breaks my heart to meet people who have had to flee a war twice in their lives and now don\'t know if they will ever be able to return home."\n\nSteinmeier listens to Neyman\'s story\n\n\'Vicious cynicism\'\n\nSteinmeier said he was deeply affected by their stories. He spoke of the "truly vicious cynicism" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had cited the baseless claim of "denazification" as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine. The stories of these survivors, Steinmeier said, are proof of Putin\'s hypocrisy.\n\nMost of them come from eastern Ukraine, specifically Dnipro, a city that has been hit by Russian missiles almost every day for weeks. Steinmeier asked whether they were all transported by bus, to which Neyman responded that it took three days in an ambulance to get to the Ukrainian-Polish border. All six of them traveled to Poland, she said, and then on to Germany.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Steinmeier spoke of his mother, who was among the many ethnic Germans expelled from Poland at the end of World War II. "We were always very aware of what it means to lose your house and home and have to start over completely again," he said.\n\nSteinmeier\'s visit was well-received by the group of elderly survivors, one of whom asked for a selfie as he left. The others thanked him when he told them: "You are welcome here, you can rely on our help."\n\nThis reception came in stark contrast to the criticism directed at the president in recent weeks, which saw Kyiv refuse his offer of an official visit after he was accused of being too sympathetic to Russia during his two terms as foreign minister. Instead of traveling to Ukraine, he has been meeting displaced Ukrainians in Germany as well as Ukraine\'s Eastern European neighbors.\n\nJewish groups organize evacuations\n\nSo far, nearly 80 Holocaust survivors have fled to Germany from Ukraine and are being housed across the country.\n\nThe "El Jana" home in eastern Berlin is still fairly new. The full-time care facility was completed shortly before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and has not yet been fully occupied. Although the building is subjected to the roar of the nearby airport, street traffic, and trains, the building is an oasis of peace for its new inhabitants.\n\nThat the dozens of survivors have made it to Germany is thanks to the commitment and help from the Jewish Claims Conference (JCC), an organization that has been providing financial and medical assistance to Holocaust survivors for years.\n\nAs soon as they realized that the Russian invasion could jeopardize that assistance, the JCC set to work organizing evacuations. At first, only a handful wanted to leave their homes, but that number gradually increased, according to Rüdiger Mahlo, the JCC\'s representative in Germany.\n\nFor those who did not want to come to Germany, evacuations were also organized for Israel or other European destinations.\n\nWatch video 00:59 Ukrainian Holocaust survivors take shelter in Germany\n\nHelping hands\n\nAccording to Mahlo, more evacuees are arriving in Germany every day, a process that required around 50 people from 15 different organizations, including the Central Welfare Office of Jews in Germany (ZWST). Those assisting on a daily basis include full-time employees of welfare associations, but also many volunteers.\n\nAid workers have also been quick to thank the support of locals, who have donated the clothes, medical equipment, and other necessities that the new arrivals need.\n\nFor the El Jana facility, this also means a demanding commitment from employees who speak Russian, according to director Laura Rose. "For them, it means twelve-hour shifts now. There must always be someone there, even at night and on weekends, who speaks Russian," she said.\n\nAlthough the survivors thanked Steinmeier for the hospitality they have received in Germany, they made it clear that their wish for the future is to return to Ukraine.\n\n"Thank you for the very warm welcome. But still, we all want to go home as soon as possible," they told the president.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you\'re here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

This issue of New Eastern Europe brings you some tales and reflections of the brave Ukrainians who have united to fight the invading aggressor.\n\nThese stories provide a distinct account – some of which are written in a diary format – of the first month of the war, the incredibly horrible period when Russian troops were brutally attacking villages on the road to Kyiv and elsewhere in the country. The disturbing images of the Russian inhumanity only emerged after the Ukrainians successfully defended the areas around the capital.\n\nThis issue also analyses the impact that the war has or will have on the region and beyond. Our authors examine the sanctions against Russia, the role of Belarus in the war, Poland’s new position as a frontline country as well as the future of Russia’s relations with the West. A significant development of the wartime has been not only the unity of the European Union and NATO but also the fact that all three countries known as the Associated Trio (Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia) have officially submitted applications to become members of the EU. These developments clearly demonstrate that the war has not only brought tragic results, but historical ones as well.\n\nLastly, the issue provides a look at the extraordinary level of human response to the war, including humanitarian activities and the welcoming of refugees.

Something like this would have never happened if Angela Merkel were still in power, critics utter in Berlin and Brussels.\n\nHowever, this is only part of the story. While Scholz’s leadership skills have been criticised in recent weeks – even by his coalition partners in the FDP and the Greens – the problem is much more profound.\n\nFor Germany, foreign policy was always rooted in its economic interests. It resembled more of an external economic policy instead of focusing on the tough decisions that come with the mess that is international security.\n\nLeadership in Europe meant, first and foremost, protecting its economic interests and spreading its ordoliberal model across Europe.\n\nThis ‘economy first’ approach was, of course, also the reason why Berlin could exert dominance during the euro and Greek debt crisis because all that foreign policy was about was economics.\n\nIn hindsight, it almost feels as if Germany stumbled through the messy place that is international security blindfolded. After all, Merkel was responsible for Germany’s energy dependency on Russia.\n\nAnd economic interests once again prevailed over security concerns when she disregarded the warnings by allies and laid the groundwork for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline – only a few years after Russia revealed its true colours in Ukraine and annexed Crimea.\n\nGermany managed to lead Europe as long as the EU was primarily concerned with questions of economic integration and the problems that come with it.

The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nOn February 24th 2022 the world awoke to the news that the Russian Federation had begun a brutal invasion and attack from land, sea and air against independent and free Ukraine. That terrible winter morning confirmed that the evidence gathered by US intelligence and shared with the world weeks before was indeed correct. Russia’s large-scale military invasion was inevitable. It was to take place, despite our utter disbelief.\n\nRussia’s plan of mass aggression directed at the Ukrainian people could also have been gathered from the televised speech that Vladimir Putin delivered on February 21st, just a few days before the invasion. In this over one-hour-long gloomy talk to the Russian nation (and indeed the whole world), Putin bluntly declared his hatred of the former republics, now independent states, and bitterness over the collapse of the Soviet Union. The communist state’s breakup is for him, as we have long known, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. Today, it is crystal clear that Putin will not spare anything that humanity holds dear in order to restore the Russian empire and halt the NATO alliance from accepting new members.\n\nCowardice and denial\n\nThe brutality of the Russian army since the start of the invasion not only shows that Putin has no respect for international norms or human lives, but also that his own state – the Russian Federation – has become a repressive fascist system. The infamous letter “Z”, first painted on Russian military vehicles, has now become an explicit symbol of this fascism. But the truth is that Russia has been on the totalitarian path for quite some time now. We have just refused to accept this, naively believing that the lessons of the Second World War had been internalised long ago and its atrocities would never be repeated. This was especially true immediately after the Cold War, when it appeared that liberal democracy would prevail worldwide as part of the “end of history”.\n\nToday, when news about Russia’s hideous crimes against the Ukrainian nation reaches us daily, we have to admit that Russia acted in this way partly because of our own cowardice and denial. To put it honestly, it was us, the international community, that absolved the Russian Federation from accountability for its many brutal invasions in the past. These actions started with Moldova and Chechnya in the 1990s, then Georgia, Syria, Crimea and Donbas in the first and second decades of the 21st century. Like now in Ukraine, all these other places witnessed the Russian army commit crimes against humanity. Yet, instead of punishing those responsible for the atrocities in our international system of justice, we stood by, silently watching as the Kremlin ordered the murders of those who had openly opposed them in Russia and abroad.\n\nAmong those who were killed is Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered for informing the world on the reality of the Second Chechen War. Natalya Estemirova, a human rights activist, was also assassinated in Chechnya for similar reasons. We all remember the murder of Boris Nemtsov, who was killed for his reports on the Russian military intervention in Donbas. The closure of Memorial – an organisation that investigated Stalin’s brutal crimes – should have been no surprise as the totalitarian regime began closing its ranks internally.\n\nAnd while we may have been shocked by all these events and even expressed our anger publicly, we did very little to prevent them from happening again. Some in the West believed that these were even isolated incidents or that business with Russia did not necessarily mean business with those killers responsible for these horrible yet largely ignored crimes. Russian disinformation and propaganda fuelled ignorance and provided a cover for those who valued business over morals, and profits over lives.\n\nInformation pervasion\n\nRussia also gained a foothold in many of our own countries, often exploiting corrupt politicians and disseminating state-sponsored fake news and disinformation that inflamed internal divides. By allowing Russia Today, later RT, and Sputnik, primarily broadcast in English (the global lingua franca, but also translated into many other languages), to frequent our media landscape, we believed that we were adhering to our cherished democratic values like freedom of speech. Under the impression that these channels were offering “a different perspective”, we allowed Putin’s sick vision of restoring the Russian empire to take root in our societies and Kremlin-created narratives meant to divide us to enter into our discourse.\n\nThus, in 2014, instead of talking about the Russian war against Ukraine, we could read about a “civil conflict” in Ukraine; “the Ukrainian crisis”; and the problem of “Ukrainian nationalists”. These phrases, however, as many finally learnt in 2021 and 2022, were only to serve as a background for a much stronger lie. It was uttered by Putin himself and used as a pretext to start the current war. He falsely stated that Ukraine has no historical right to exist and even requires “denazification”.\n\nThe “denazification” of a state whose president is Jewish is obviously a groundless argument. Yet, we have to admit that many politicians in our own countries have long been under the influence of Russia. Thanks to this, we have witnessed many destructive trends that have severely damaged not only the operations of our state institutions and political processes, but also brought on deep divisions within our highly polarised societies. Almost any issue that requires a democratic choice has become prey to Russian manipulation via its disinformation machine, online trolls, bots and useful idiots. This is true for elections, but also COVID-19, Brexit, abortion rights, race relations, LGBTQ+ rights and many other issues. Instead of adequately diagnosing the sources of these divisions, we eagerly joined in; fanning the flames that were stoked by Russia’s interference. While we cannot blame Russia for everything wrong within our own societies, we do need to acknowledge all the risks it poses to our social cohesion through echo-chambers, bubbles and cancel culture.\n\nOur money also allowed Russia to grow. We nourished the monster in the Kremlin through vast and numerous business deals that we now find so difficult to free ourselves from. For some, business with Russia is still acceptable even if their daily news reports highlight the inhumane blockade of Mariupol and the shelling of breadlines in Kharkiv. Several EU member states remain prone to pressure from Russia, having ignored repeated calls for the diversification of their energy supply.\n\nWho provoked who?\n\nUnfortunately, there are still commentators, politicians and opinion makers in the West who continue to act as useful idiots for the Kremlin by claiming that it is NATO’s fault Russia invaded Ukraine. They say that NATO provoked the conflict and Russia is only acting in its own self-defence. Is Moscow defending itself by brutally killing civilians in the thousands? By destroying entire cities and forcibly moving their populations to various regions in Russia, including the Far East? How we can even point the finger at anyone else beyond Putin and his regime is still a deep-seated mystery. Besides, NATO does not “expand”; it has an “open door policy”. In other words, if a country wishes or decides that it is in its own best interests to join the Alliance, NATO will welcome them into the family after it conforms to the highest western standards. Seeing how Russia assaults those who even consider joining NATO, we should not doubt the importance of the Alliance. What if Poland did not decide to join NATO in 1999 and waited to announce such intentions until 2015? It would not take much imagination to fathom how Putin would have reacted in such a scenario. The argument that NATO provoked Russia is another example of the Russian narrative being regurgitated in mainstream western media. The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nNot that long ago, we were disgusted by the revelations in Alexei Navalny’s film about Putin’s mansion. But no one really bothered to speak up against the gas pipeline that allowed him to reach such levels of wealth. Many in the West in fact never felt obliged enough to see their business with Russia as an act of corruption. Yet many of them were eager to point to Ukraine as being corrupt and hence unable to “meet European democratic standards”. We expected Ukrainians to listen to our guidelines on what modern statehood should look like, but their arguments (or those in Poland or the Baltic states) on why Nord Stream 2 is dangerous for the region and our security went ignored, written off as wild “Russophobia”.\n\nNow, Europe and the West face their greatest challenge since the end of the Cold War and perhaps since the outbreak of the Second World War. The refugee crisis that the Russian forces have now set in motion through their indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine will be an immense and lengthy test. The tactics of total war have already forced a large percentage of Ukraine’s future beyond its borders. It must remain a priority for the international community to provide them with care and safety. Pushing these masses of civilians into Poland, Romania and Moldova in particular is also part of the Russian strategy to put these countries under pressure, sow divisions and exhaust resources. These countries and their allies must quickly come to terms with the fact that they are now on the frontline.\n\nTowards a common victory\n\nNow, of course, we have reached a stage of western unity and solidarity with Ukraine. The response by the transatlantic community to Russia’s invasion was impressive. Putin certainly did not expect such a reaction. A new emboldened sanctions regime has been introduced and Nord Stream 2 has finally been put on hold (yet for how long, we do not know). How this war will end depends on many factors. The brave and courageous Ukrainians defending their home, led and inspired by their democratically elected president, convince us that victory is not only possible but likely. However, peace at any cost cannot be the western-imposed solution to Putin’s war. Ukraine has already sacrificed too much. It has lost too many husbands, wives, sons, daughters and grandparents. Instead, peace can only come with Ukraine’s victory; its territorial integrity intact and its future bright and prosperous.\n\nThe Russian totalitarian regime must be held to account for its crimes in this war. This includes an end to Vladimir Putin’s rule in the Kremlin. A return to business as usual, drunk on Russian disinformation and corrupted by dirty money – to a place where we were before February 24th – is no longer possible. There is only one outcome: Ukraine’s victory and the renewal of the West and its promise of a new future. The price that Ukraine is paying today cannot and will not be made in vain.

Poland and Bulgaria would be the first countries to have their gas cut off by Europe\'s main supplier since Russia started what it calls a military operation in Ukraine on February 24. The move to cut off supplies also followed sanctions imposed by Poland against Russian individuals and companies. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that countries he terms "unfriendly" agree to a scheme under which they would open accounts at Gazprombank and make payments for Russian gas imports in euros or US dollars that would be converted into roubles. Poland is a staunch political opponent of Russia. Polish gas company PGNiG, whose gas deal with Russia expires at the end of this year, has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract. It also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland. Poland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year, and covers about 50 per cent of national consumption. Earlier, data from the European Union network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted but they resumed later on Tuesday. Poland\'s energy supplies were secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said on Tuesday, adding there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut. Gazprom also informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it would halt gas supplies from Wednesday, the energy ministry said. Bulgaria also had a contract due to expire at the end of the year. It meets more than 90 per cent of its gas needs with Gazprom\'s imports about 3 bcm a year. Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at data intelligence firm ICIS, said: "This is a seismic warning shot by Russia." "Poland has had an anti-Russia and anti-Gazprom stance for a number of years, which is not the case for Bulgaria, so to see Bulgaria also be cut off is also quite a development in its own right," he said. Bulgaria said it had taken steps to find alternative gas supply and no restrictions on gas consumption was required for now. Germany\'s network regulator said it was monitoring the gas delivery situation from Russia after the threat to Poland supplies, adding that supply to Germany was currently guaranteed.

This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the biggest Orthodox holiday," Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also spoke about yesterday\'s visit by top US officials. "Assistance to Ukraine was the number one issue in talks with representatives of the United States of America, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin," Zelenskyy said.\n\n"We share the same understanding with the United States: when democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world. When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world," said the Ukrainian president.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskyy also mentioned the morning air raids in the Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv and Odesa regions.

The missiles flew to western Ukraine from the southeast, Kozytskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe added that the missiles were likely fired from Russian strategic aircraft. He had no information yet about possible victims.\n\nKyiv needs long-range fires and tanks — US Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed and that Kyiv now needs long-range fires for both artillery and missiles, as well as tanks.\n\nAustin said that he and Blinken had discussed "security assistance" and "training" with Ukrainian officials. He said that the meeting was to talk about things that would "enable us to win the current fight and also build for tomorrow."\n\n"We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," Austin said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke to reporters following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nAustin is scheduled to go to the Ramstein US Air Base in western Germanyon Tuesday to speak with allies on how best to support Ukraine.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense said it is difficult for the US to track what happens to weapons transferred to Ukraine as there are no US forces on the ground, but added that he spoke to Kyiv to make sure weapons were tracked as best as possible.\n\nRussia \'failing\' in its war aims — Blinken\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press conference following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Russia has been "failing" when it came to its war aims in Ukraine, while Kyiv is "succeeding."\n\n"Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine," Blinken said. "That has failed."\n\nBlinken said that Russia\'s military was underperforming and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin\'s on the scene," Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees "final success."\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "things are beginning to get back to normal" in Kyiv, but noted that "that\'s in stark contrast to what\'s going on" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas — UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain\'s defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, "Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials.

Moscow was the fifth largest spender in the world, behind the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nUkraine\'s military spending has risen by 72% since Russia\'s annexation of Crimea in 2014. It spent $5.9 billion, or 3.2% of the country\'s GDP, in 2021.\n\nTotal spending in Europe in 2021 amounted to $418 billion, 3% higher than in 2020 and 19% higher than in 2012. Many European countries have contributed substantial military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, and third-largest spender Germany boosted its military aid budget to €2 billion a little over a week ago.\n\nThe United States saw a drop in expenditure in 2021 due to a drop in American spending on research and development. The US is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, having provided an additional $800 million in mid-April and another $322 million this Sunday.\n\nWatch video 02:24 US approves more military aid to Ukraine\n\nBlinken and Austin announce aid, diplomatic surge\n\nThe United States will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military financing and has approved a $165 million sale of ammunition to the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe announcement came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt was the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war.\n\nThe US officials also pledged further assistance worth $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries, with the $322 million earmarked specifically for Kyiv.\n\nThe new money brings the total amount of US military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said.\n\nThe two returned overland to Poland after their meeting.

When we are imposing sanctions, we need to do so in a way that maximizes pressure on Russia while minimizing collateral damage on ourselves," Dombrovskis said.\n\nEurope spends around $450 million (€417 million) per day on Russian crude oil and refined products.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand show support for Ukraine at ANZAC Day commemorations\n\nThe leaders of Australia and New Zealand used their annual speeches on Anzac Day to show support for Ukraine.\n\nAnzac Day marks the anniversary of Australian and New Zealand soldiers landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in 1915 during World War I but is now used to commemorate troops from all conflicts.\n\n"The invasion of Ukraine is a senseless act of war, one that is taking the lives of innocent people. It is a threat to the international laws that a nation like ours relies on — but it is also a threat to our sense of humanity. And that makes it a threat to all of us," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said\n\nNew Zealand was physically distanced from the conflict but "inextricably linked" to what it represented, Ardern added.\n\nAcross the Tasman sea, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the people of Ukraine, who are fighting a Russian invasion.\n\n"On this particular day, as we honor those who fought for our liberty and freedom, we stand with the people of Ukraine who do the same thing at this very moment," Morrison said.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nSummary of Sunday\'s events in Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv.

For all of RFE/RL\'s coverage of the war, click here.\n\nFighting continued on April 26 in eastern Ukraine, where the city of Kreminna in the Luhansk region has reportedly fallen to the Russians.\n\nStreet-to-street fighting had been going on for days in Kreminna, with civilian evacuations there made impossible by the war, the British Ministry of Defense said on Twitter on April 26.\n\nThe British report said heavy fighting was under way in the south of the city of Izyum, as Russian forces try to advance toward the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defenses in Zaporizhzhya in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," it added in the regular bulletin, also saying that Russian troops were likely to attempt to encircle Ukrainian Army\'s heavily fortified positions in the east.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that more help for Ukraine was on the way, as he convened a meeting of officials from around 40 countries at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany to pledge more weapons.\n\n"This gathering reflects the galvanized world," Austin said in his opening remarks .He added that he wanted officials to leave the meeting “with a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to keep moving heaven and earth so that we can meet them.”\n\nAfter the meeting, Austin said in a press conference that the forum would continue as a monthly contact group that would discuss Ukraine\'s defense needs.\n\n"The contact group will be a vehicle for nations of goodwill to intensify our efforts, coordinate our assistance, and focus on winning today\'s fight and the struggles to come," Austin said.\n\nAustin also praised a decision by Germany, which said it had cleared the way for the delivery of Gepard antiaircraft guns to Ukraine.\n\nAustin -- who visited Ukraine with Blinken over the weekend and announced an extra $700 million in military aid to Ukraine -- said Washington wants to see "Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," adding that Kyiv can still win the war if given the right support.\n\nThe United States has sent some $4 billion in military aid since President Joe Biden\'s term began last year, and already announced a new $800 million aid package last week.\n\nLavrov said late on April 25 that Western arms shipments to Ukraine mean that NATO is essentially engaging in war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy, and weapons delivered to Ukraine from the West will be "legitimate targets" for the Russian military.\n\nLavrov also warned of the threat of a third world war and said there was a "considerable" risk of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons.\n\n"The danger is serious, it is real, it must not be underestimated," Lavrov said.\n\nBut Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Lavrov\'s comments are meant to just "scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\nEarlier, Russia\'s ambassador in Washington told the United States to halt arms shipments, warning that large Western deliveries of weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nWith reporting by AP, AFP, BBC, and Reuters', 'image': 'https://gdb.rferl.org/2ED3AF50-E135-48F8-B1B5-2BFEDB2AE3E1_cx0_cy2_cw0_w1200_r1.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:21'}

Kyiv won 3-2 in a charity match played in front of about 35,000 fans. All proceeds will go to victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n"It is about sending a signal, a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, earning a bit of money so that we can do one or the other humanitarian action. And then it is also a sign against this despicable war of aggression," Dortmund managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke told broadcasters ZDF.\n\nKyiv has played similar fund-raising matches in Warsaw, Istanbul and Cluj.\n\nPutin claims he hopes for diplomatic agreement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Moscow. In televised remarks, he told Guterres that he still hoped for negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject [talks]," Putin told Guterres, who was visiting Moscow.\n\nHe said talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv. He claimed without evidence, that the massacres in Bucha were not carried out by Russians.\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nGuterres reiterated his call for Ukraine and Russia to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe broadcast discussions showed Guterres and Putin sitting opposite each other at the large oval table in the hall of the Senate Palace, following an hour-long meeting in the Kremlin. Guterres earlier met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov where he called for a ceasefire.\n\nItaly considers nationalizing Lukoil-owned refinery\n\nItaly is reportedly considering temporarily nationalizing a refinery owned by Lukoil — a Russian multinational energy corporation — as a response to possible sanctions on Russian oil.\n\nLukoil, which is not the subject of sanctions, owns the ISAB refinery — Italy\'s largest oil refinery by capacity. It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense. Speaking at the event, Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense, told reporters that "we have to move at the speed of war."\n\nAustin said the US was determined to make better use of the US European Command\'s coordination mechanism and would extend the forum for Ukraine\'s defense into a monthly contact group.\n\n"We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and make it less able to do that," Austin said.\n\nAustin went on to express sharp criticism of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who warned on Monday that World War III might be looming.\n\n"You\'ve heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful," Austin said. "Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence.

This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing.

The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes. Russia\'s Defense Ministry claimed it used missiles to destroy facilities powering the railways supplying Ukrainian forces with foreign weapons.\n\nAbout 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. Ukraine has claimed 22,000 Russian troops were killed since the invasion. Russia has acknowledged only 1,351 military deaths.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalize parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims.\n\nAfter a visit to Kyiv, Blinken said Russia\'s military was underperforming, and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nWatch video 02:54 Russian missiles strike Ukrainian rail stations\n\nYou can revisit our live updates from April 25 here.\n\nsi, lo, aw/wmr, rs, mhm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61602081_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:19'}

Russia is also proving that energy resources are a weapon. That is why the EU needs to be united and impose an embargo on energy resources, depriving the Russians of their energy weapons.”\n\nThe move will be a grave concern to those countries who are the most heavily dependent on Russian gas, such as Germany, but at a hastily arranged press conference, Polish ministers said they had sufficient supplies to weather an interruption while accusing Gazprom of a breach of contract.\n\nAnna Moskwa, Poland’s minister for climate, said: “There are no worries about shortages of gas in our homes. It is worth pointing out that liquified natural gas alone supplies the market sufficiently. LNG deliveries in [terminal] Świnoujście are growing – in 2015 there was one, in 2021 it was already 35. As of today, it provides for about 50 deliveries.”\n\nShe added: “Appropriate diversification strategies that we have introduced allow us to feel on the safe side in this situation.”\n\nPGNiG, Poland’s largest gas supplier, said it would file a breach of contract lawsuit over Gazprom’s decision.\n\nRussia currently supplies about 55% of Poland’s annual demand of about 21bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas but the country’s government has still been pushing the EU and other western allies to go further in punishing the Kremlin.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Bulgaria’s energy ministry said it had been told that supplies of Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline would also cease on Wednesday.\n\nOnce a close ally of Moscow, Bulgaria has cut many of its ties with Russia, supporting sanctions against Russia and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\nPrime Minister Kiril Petkov and members of his coalition government were due to travel to Kyiv on Wednesday for aid talks with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Balkan country meets more than 90% of its gas needs with Russian imports, but the government insisted that no restrictions would be imposed on domestic gas consumption would be imposed for.\n\nThe NGO Europe Beyond Coal has calculated that the EU has sent more than €41bn (£34.7bn) to Russia in payments for fossil fuels since it invaded Ukraine two months ago.\n\nPoland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, had already said he intended to ban Russian gas and oil imports by the end of the year and there has been a move to diversify to cover for losses.\n\nThe key Yamal pipeline carries natural gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, through Belarus. But the Polish government had made a clear move away from dependency by constructing a liquefied natural gas terminal in the Baltic port of Świnoujście, run by Qatari and US companies, which is capable of handling 5 bcm of gas. It is being expanded to 7.5 bcm by 2023.\n\nThe extent to which Polish industry will be able to rely on this flow is yet to be seen, however, and other countries will be worried about the development.\n\nMoscow had warned clients in March that they risked having their gas supplies cut unless they paid in roubles.\n\nThe European Commission had nevertheless said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars.\n\nThe only EU leader who has suggested he would pay Gazprom in roubles is Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, whose rightwing government has pursued a close relationship with Putin’s regime for over a decade.\n\nThe move by the Kremlin comes as EU member states are drawing up a sixth wave of sanctions that could include imposing a ceiling on the price paid for Russian oil.\n\nBut there remains a reluctance in Berlin, in particular, to go hard on gas imports given the German economy’s dependence on Russia in that field.\n\nIn early April, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told the Bundestag that the country’s energy reliance had “grown over decades and cannot be ended from one day to the next”, given that it would lead to the rationing of energy to industry and the potential closure of its largest factories.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gazprom denied that gas flows to Poland had been stopped. Spokesperson Sergei Kupriyanov said: “Today Poland has to pay for gas supplies according to the new payment procedure.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/420e247b8a553addda3a467a546bd7b9ad9b5477/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ae70b85c18886bd10a227f8648798a1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:05'}

Click here for updates from April 24.\n\nMariupol Officials Say New Mass Grave Found\n\nOfficials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new mass grave has been identified north of the city.\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) north of Mariupol.\n\nSatellite photos released over the past several days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nMariupol has been decimated by fierce fighting over the past two months. The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk.

Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:40'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war.

Unsurprisingly, many of these efforts have often been penetrated due to the poor and blatant construction exposed by the mainstream Western mass media that perhaps interact closely with the intelligence circles.\n\nBut this hardly means that Western governments and the mass media are bona fide disseminators of war information that is free from distortion and manipulation. This is because, in the modern and contemporary history of war, government propaganda is a commonplace. It is instrumental to mobilize, sustain and strengthen domestic and international support for war efforts, particularly when magnified by mass media. An underdog country can use such propaganda to enhance international support, especially through provision of weapons, ammunition, logistics and, if feasible, reinforcements, to complement its inferior war capability, as well as economic sanction against the top dog country. On the other hand, the latter can employ such a propaganda to enhance popular morale and supplement resource mobilization capacity.\n\nIn fact, Western government war propaganda and the mainstream mass media reports have established a predominant international opinion that sides sympathetically with Ukraine as the innocent underdog[i]. This is particularly because numerous video footage has lively covered massive exoduses of Ukrainian women and children to neighboring countries, missile bombardment and other forms of shelling against urban residential areas, and vivid images of killed and injured noncombatants as well as combatants, among others. Unfortunately, timely open-source information on evolving operational and tactical realities is limited, partial, unbalanced and/or, biased, possibly with intentional distortions and manipulations. Yet, the reports seem to prove atrocities committed by the Russian invasion forces, demonizing these forces and President Vladimir Putin at the levels of jus ad bellum and jus in bello.\n\nYet, war propaganda becomes unplausible and ineffective, especially when detached from evolving battlefield realities. Until then, war propaganda surely hampers coolheaded analysis and appropriate policy prescription on how to end a war, while unnecessarily protracting warfare involving a significantly higher death toll and further destruction.\n\nIn this light, this study will cast some different light on the tenability of the predominant factual recognition and discourse in mainstream Western mass media. The first jus in bello cases are about Western allegation of atrocities committed by the Russian side against Ukrainian non-combatants, particularly under the condition of extremely fierce urban warfare in the cities of Mariupol and Bucha. The second jus ad bellum case is about Russian allegation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine. These cases are particularly important because most of Western news and reports have flatly turned down Russian counterparts as misinformation and disinformation, without any serious examination. Certainly, the current author of this piece does not enjoy any privileged access to classified information but only to open sources. Yet, careful examination of open-source materials, including Russian and alternative media sources, may make it possible to identify blind assumptions and invalid judgements in the current dominant Western discourse, if not to present correct facts and cogent judgements.\n\n1. The Mariupol Case\n\n1) The Context\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky stated in his on-line speech of March 23 to the Japanese Diet that several thousand Ukrainian civilians, including 121 children, had been killed, together with nine millions refugees and internally displaced civilians[ii]. This unexpectedly low level of death toll may indicate that Russian invasion forces exercised certain self-restraint in attacking civilians, except collateral damage.\n\nIn fact, Douglas Macgregor[iii], a retired U.S. Army Colonel and a Senior Advisor to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, stated that, despite the strong impression generated by the repeated exposure to video footage, President Putin strictly ordered from the outset of the war to avoid killing civilians and destroying urban areas as much as possible[iv]. This is consistent with his historical outlook on the triune Russian national identity – White, Little and Great Russians (respectively, Belarussians, Ukrainians and Russians), characterized by strong historical unity and brotherhood[v]. Naturally ,it begs the question of why the Russian forces killed many Ukrainian civilians and severely destroyed urban residential areas in Ukraine, involving an inscrutable disjunction between Putin’s own creed and practice.\n\nExtremely fierce urban warfare, especially in the City of Mariupol, is a natural consequence of the stark disparity of Russian and Ukrainian military power, to which both sides have even introduced foreign volunteer fighters and mercenaries[vi]. With its overwhelming superiority, the Russian invasion forces neutralized a significant portion of main high-end platforms, assets and on-ground facilities of the Ukrainian armed forces at the initial stage of the current war, including air superiority fighters, major battle tanks and the command & control systems[vii]. This is consistent with numerous video footage available in public domain that primarily captures Ukrainian infantry operations with portable anti-tank missiles for close combat and low-altitude anti-air missiles, while few high-end platforms are visible. In fact, the Russian Defense Ministry said that, soon after the start of the war, the Russian forces totally destroyed Ukrainian Air Force combat aircraft while some of them escaped to Poland and Romania[viii]. Reportedly, the Russia forces destroyed 974 Ukrainian tanks and other armored vehicles just for the first three weeks[ix]. No wonder, MacGregor judged that the Ukrainian units still active “(were) completely surrounded, cut off and isolated in various town and cities”, with supplies likely running out soon[x]. Ukrainian infantry and special operation forces in Mariupol were cornered at bay without reinforcement nor air cover. An Azov Battalion commander there vainly urged the U.S.-led NATO to make armed intervention against Russia, especially to set an effective no-fly zone over Ukraine, while attributing a grave humanitarian crisis in the making to Russia。[xi]\n\n2) Who attacked the maternity hospital and the drama theater?\n\nThe Ukrainian government strongly condemned Russia for its military attack against a maternity hospital in Mariupol on March 17[xii], which injured 17 people including women, children and doctors, with at least five of them dead thereafter[xiii]. But Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov justified the attack because an Azov Battalion unit turned the hospital to a combat base[xiv], claiming the victims as unavoidable and lawful collateral damage. Surprisingly, the pregnant woman on spotlight in the reports later disclosed that Ukrainian soldiers used the hospital as base while holding these civilians as human shield against Russian forces, suggesting that the incident was an act of self-destruct and a false flag operation by the Ukraine’s side[xv]. This is compatible with other fragmentary video footage that capture how Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol have been used as human shield[xvi] and prevented from leaving the city[xvii].\n\nAlso, the Ukrainian government alleged, echoed aloud by major Western mass media, that, on March 16, a Russian airstrike dropped a powerful bomb on the Mariupol Drama Theater sheltering some 1,300 local residents, including women and children, and despite large signs of “children” that were clearly visible from aircraft. Reportedly, the death toll reached at least to 300[xviii]. The Russian government flatly denied the allegation and instead accused the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, of blowing up the theater building. This is compatible with the interview of a 17- year-old female survivor of the incident with the Abkhazian Network News Agency, who eye-witnessed Azov soldiers hiding themselves behind civilian hostages in the building[xix].\n\nMore specifically, a Russian military spokesman stated that Azov Battalion units held civilian hostages in the theater building as human shield, using the upper floor as firing points. This means that the Russian attack aimed at these units, involving significant civilian casualties as collateral damage during the engagement[xx]. This is a plausible account on what happened, particularly given the very similar circumstances of the above hospital case.\n\nIt is now crucially important to inquire what the Azov Battalion is all about and if the troop has the established notoriety of committing such atrocities.\n\n3）The Azov Battalion[xxi]\n\nThe Azov Battalion is now a part of the Ukrainian National Guard, which is the country’s gendarmerie under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Its name originates from the fact that it has been based in Mariupol in the Azov Sea costal region since 2014, first as a volunteer militia that fought against Russian separatist forces in the Donbas War and later in the same year incorporated into the National Guard while expanded in scale into a regiment. As Russia labels it as neo-Nazis, it in fact uses controversial symbols resembling the Nazis SS Wolfsangel, though it denies any connection with Nazism[xxii]. Yet, in 2015, an Azov spokesman disclosed 10-20% of units consisted of neo-Nazis members[xxiii]. The concern over the Azov is serious enough to the extent that the U.S. Congress enacted a legislative measure, Consolidated Appropriation Bill of 2018, to ban military aids to the paramilitary due to its white supremacist ideology and neo-Nazism[xxiv].\n\nThe Azov has faced serious allegations of committing torture and war crimes, including the grossly underinvestigated case of the 2014 Odessa Clashes in which some 50 pro-Russia separatists were killed[xxv]. In fact, the U.N. Human Rights Office of High Commissioner published reports that connect the Azov Battalion to war crimes such as mass looting, unlawful detention, and torture[xxvi]. Clearly. Russia’s counter-allegations on the above atrocities in Mariupol are at least compatible with an established understanding on Azov’s behavioral pattern connected to war crimes.\n\nActually, Russia’s emphasis and Western de-emphasis on the Azov Battalion is obscurely central to their intensified exchanges of war propaganda and counter-propaganda, on the ground that the paramilitary has constituted a major U.S instrument of covert military intervention in Russia-Ukraine armed conflict. More specifically, the CIA had a secret advisory and training program for Ukrainian paramilitaries and militias, most probably including the Azov, for eight years until shortly before the start of the current war, despite the aforementioned legislative ban. The CIA has had training centers in the U.S. and eastern Ukraine for sniper techniques[xxvii], anti-tank missile handling, covert communications, and other tactics necessary for insurgency and counter-insurgency[xxviii]. Thus, the issue of the Azov Battalion cannot simply be reduced to the question of war crimes, but can only be fully comprehended in the context of a U.S.-Russia proxy war over the Donbas region that is central to NATO expansion to Ukraine and determination of their spheres of interest.\n\n2. The Bucha Case\n\nA similar suspicion of war propaganda is not easily excludable, with a focus on the atrocities allegedly committed by the Russian armed forces against local Ukrainian civilians in the city of Bucha. Major Western governments and the mainstream mass media are condemning, with strongest terms, the unspeakable atrocities against local Ukrainian civilians on the way of retreat after hard battles to vainly capture Kiev. However, on March 31 when the Russian forces left the city, its mayor did not at all mention of the atrocities in an interview with a Ukrainian on-line news site[xxix] which is compatible with his bright expression in a selfie video taken on the same day[xxx]. On April 2, when Ukrainian army forces entered the city to make sure of a complete retreat of the Russian forces, the video footage by a local news media captured no corpse on roads and no sign of emotional distress among the local population. On April 1, Azov Battalion troops entered the city[xxxi], and on April 3, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense released video footage as evidence of the atrocities committed by the Russian forces, which neither the New York Times nor the Pentagon are independently able to verify the assertion of the Ministry[xxxii]. In addition, in the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. and the U.K. blocked Russia’s proposal to send an independent fact-finding mission to Ukraine[xxxiii].\n\nThus, there is a good possibility that the Azov Battalion might have fabricated or purposefully committed at least some parts of the “atrocities” by itself[xxxiv]. (More specifically, to differentiate which camp they belong, pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian civilians wear blue or white armbands respectively. Many corpses in Bucha wore white armbands as in video footage available. The Azov and/or other ultra-right militia units may have committed the atrocities out of emotional impulse, while the mass media and propaganda section of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs may have made up the scene to impute responsibilities of war crime to the Russian invasion forces[xxxv]. It should be reminded that the current war has the dimension of ethnic conflict as well as that of inter-state war.)\n\nGiven the leading role of BBC reports on this matter with the analysis of a satellite image, this begs the question of if the U.K. intelligence circles are engaged in elaborate war propaganda against Russia to mislead and manipulate other major Western governments and mass media[xxxvi].\n\n3. The Case of Biological Weapon R&D\n\nPossession of weapon of mass destruction by a revisionist power may constitute a casus belli of a status quo power, particularly when the latter sees the former’s move as its existential threat or serious threat against its vital national interests. Yet, legitimatizing a war has to satisfy some procedural requirements according to international law with presentation of solid evidence to the international society.\n\nIn this light, Russia’s allegation on Ukraine’s nuclear weapon programs is not tenable at all, at least at this point, due to its abrupt aggression against Ukraine without presenting any substantial evidence[xxxvii]. Also, there are little significant related information in public domain, though Ukraine has active nuclear power plants with some substantial potential to develop nuclear weapons as the country was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nBut Russia’s accusation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine, as articulated with a trove of original documentation by Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, Commander of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troop of the Russian Army[xxxviii], is not totally deniable but seems plausible with open-source information[xxxix]. Most remarkably, Victoria Nuland, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, admitted the existence of biolaboratories in Ukraine under the bilateral cooperative programs of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency during a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations[xl], while the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department unequivocally denied U.S.-funded biological weapon laboratories in Ukraine[xli]. In addition, an official letter from an official in charge at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to a project manager of Black & Veatch, a DTRA contractor, attests to their significant collaborative research relationship, while another official letter from an official in charge at the DTRA office in Kiev to an official in charge at the Ukraine Ministry Defense indicates their clear awareness of the potential usefulness of their research collaboration for biological weapon development[xlii].\n\nCertainly, the Agency’s Biological Threat Reduction Programs may serve bona fide statutory purposes, not designed to contribute to virus and other biological weapon R&D. Yet, suspicion remains, given that the offense and defense of biological warfare is generally the head and tail of similar biological weapon technologies while there is no clear demarcation line between military and civil research in most advanced virus and other biological R&D that involves genetic manipulation. The lack of confidence in the sectoral culture has recently become worse because Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the President Biden, hid the fact before a Senate hearing that the EcoHealth Alliance, New York City-based nonprofit organization, funneled U.S. public funds to gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses at China’s Wuhan lab, making it feasible to bypass stringent domestic regulations and strict public eyes. The experiment is suspected potentially useful for biological weapon R&D, and a virus leak from the lab might have been a primary cause of the current COVIT-19 pandemic[xliii].\n\n4. Reflection\n\nHitherto, this investigative inquiry has cast significant doubt and suspicion on the established Western discourse that sided uncritically with Ukraine in its war against hyper-demonized Russia, almost exclusively on the basis of Western government war information and mass media reports, and without carefully checking Russian reports.\n\nOf course, Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine is utterly indisputable, and a great number of innocent Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the current war, either in atrocity or collateral damage. But who killed how many civilians and in what ways is not self-evident as reported in the Western media, especially in the context of ethnic conflict and urban warfare as the world learnt from gross information manipulation in the former Yugoslavia ethnic conflict[xliv]. It is increasingly necessary to check Western reports carefully against Russian ones, while verifying the authenticity of allegedly “original” U.S. documents presented by the Russian government and mass media. The U.S. government will be accountable, if verified.\n\nInundated with propaganda and counter-propaganda both by the West and Russia day after day, both political leaders and the public in the West will suffer self-poisoning effect of the hyper-demonized image of Russia on making coolheaded policy analysis. It is high time that the Western governments and mainstream mass media recalibrate war propaganda and counter-propaganda, in view of the need to think of how to end the current war and to keep diplomatic channels open with Russia that would most unlikely capitulate, given that it is a nuclear power coequal to the United States.\n\n[i] Despite the current image of an innocent victim, Ukraine has continually played a disturbing role to Asian and international security, particularly because it sold an ex-Soviet aircraft career, Varyag, as scrap to China, that has been already repaired and commissioned as the country’s first aircraft career, Liaoning; and because Ukraine has not effectively banned outflows of ballistic missile technologies to North Korea that has significantly contributed to the development of its nuclear weapon programs.

EU countries have largely refused that demand, saying it breaks contracts denominated in dollars and euros.\n\nThe European Commission said that such payments would violate EU sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nPGNiG said it continued "to settle its liabilities for natural gas delivered under the Yamal Contract in accordance with its current terms."\n\nThe Polish utility demanded that Gazprom resume gas deliveries. If that doesn\'t happen, it warned: "the Company reserves the right to claim damages."\n\n"There is no contractual basis for the suspension of the supply of the gas delivered under the Yamal Contract," PGNiG said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Gazprom spokesperson Sergey Kupriyanov told reporters in Moscow: "Poland is obliged to pay for gas supplies in accordance with the new payment procedure," according to the official TASS news agency.\n\nBulgaria also balked at the demand to pay in rubles. The new Russian payment system is "at odds with the agreement that is effective until the end of this year and poses considerable risks for the Bulgarian side," said the energy ministry.\n\nPoland has vowed to end imports of Russian coal, gas and oil, and is pressing other EU countries to rapidly do the same.\n\n"We are prepared for the complete cut off of Russian fossil fuels," Polish Energy Minister Anna Moskwa said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nPoland gets 46 percent of its gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia, according to Forum Energii, a think tank.\n\nPolish authorities insisted that the cutoff won\'t affect gas users.\n\n"Thanks to the implementation of the government\'s strategy of diversifying gas supply sources, PGNiG is prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on the western and southern borders and the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście," said PGNiG.\n\nMoskwa said: "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security," adding that the country\'s gas storage was 80 percent full. She said Poland will continue to buy gas on European and international markets and aims to fill its reserves to 100 percent.\n\nBulgaria, which gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia, said it has "taken steps to ensure alternative supplies of natural gas and handle the situation. Measures to restrict consumption in Bulgaria are unnecessary at this stage."\n\nPoland\'s 1996 agreement with Gazprom expires at the end of the year, and Warsaw has said it won\'t be renewed. Piotr Naimski, in charge of strategic energy infrastructure, said that Poland was already planning to end Russian gas supplies, and that Tuesday\'s decision by Gazprom "speeds that up."\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, news that gas flows from Russia to Poland showed a precipitous decline caused spot gas prices to spike. Month-ahead gas contracts on the EU benchmark TTF trading hub in the Netherlands rose from €91 per megawatt-hour to €107/MWh around 4:30 p.m. before settling back to €99/MWh.\n\nThis article has been updated to add that Gazprom will also stop shipments to Bulgaria.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26/GettyImages-1368239012.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:26'}

But Johnson insisted that the West did not need to make concessions despite the nuclear threat.\n\n“People say we have to make a concession, we have to worry about what Putin might do because of the risk of his defeat,” Johnson said. “I think he has got a lot of space, he has got a lot of room for manoeuvre.”\n\n10:02pm: Gazprom has informed Bulgaria, Poland of halt to gas supplies from Wednesday\n\nRussia’s Gazprom has informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it will halt gas supplies as of Wednesday, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ministry said that along with state gas companies it has taken steps to find alternative arrangements for the supply of natural gas and to deal with the situation.\n\nIt said for the time being no restrictions in the gas consumption in the Balkan country which meets over 90 percent of its gas needs with Gazprom’s imports, were required.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Polish officials had said Russia is suspending natural gas deliveries to Poland beginning Wednesday morning after that country refused a demand to pay for its supplies in Russian rubles\n\nPoland’s state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Russian gas giant Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop on Wednesday.\n\nPolish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources.

We are negotiating, we do not reject (talks)," Putin told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was visiting Moscow, in televised remarks.\n\nSitting across from Guterres at a long table at the Kremlin, Putin said efforts at talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, speaks to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting in the Kremlin, in Moscow, Russia, on April 26, 2022. © Vladimir Astapkovich, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nPutin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia\'s military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.\n\nGuterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (see 2:02pm, below) for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\n6:45pm: Blinken says Putin not \'serious\' about Ukraine diplomacy\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the Ukraine war, despite a series of international efforts.\n\n“We’ve seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: “Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table.”\n\nBlinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlinken hailed what he saw on the trip and said that the US was speeding up arms deliveries, with the process now often taking only 72 hours after Ukraine sends requests.\n\n6:10pm: Germany confirms plans to send Ukraine tanks, in policy shift\n\nGermany said Tuesday it would send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a clear switch in Berlin’s cautious policy on military backing for Kyiv that was welcomed by the United States.\n\nThe government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the US Ramstein airbase.\n\nThe move comes after heavy criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to Ukraine, despite announcing a “turning point” in German defence policy in response to Russia’s invasion.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the pledge to send “some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems”, the English name for the weapons, was “especially welcome”.\n\n5:19pm: US Defence Secretary says US, allies to meet monthly on arming Ukraine\n\nThe United States and its allies will meet once a month to discuss Ukraine\'s defence needs to battle invading Russian troops, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.\n\n"Today\'s gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine\'s self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\n4:53pm: FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg on the fallout over blasts in Transnistria, Moldova\n\n02:48 © FRANCE 24\n\n4:08pm: Putin, Erdogan discuss humanitarian corridors in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow’s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin statement, the leaders in a phone call talked about “efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors”.\n\nThis came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.\n\nThe Kremlin said Erdogan asked Putin about the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe Russian leader told him that “the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there”.\n\n3:09pm: Nearly 5.3 million flee Ukraine war as refugees, up more than 32,000 since Monday\n\nNearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.\n\nIn total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 32,753 over Monday\'s figure.\n\nWhile the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday (see 11:31am, below) that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.\n\n2:02 pm: Guterres says Russia, UN have \'very different\' views of events in Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had "very frank" discussions with Lavrov. He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol.

Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy.

But the Ukrainians, aided by Western weapons, bogged down President Vladimir Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its focus is in the eastern region of the Donbas, but one senior military official says it also wants to control southern Ukraine.

No cause was given for the blaze.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries.\n\nA Russian news report said that another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire early Monday.\n\nIn footage later released by the Ukrainian presidency of the meeting with top US officials, Mr Blinken praised the “extraordinary courage and leadership and success that you’ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression”.\n\nMr Austin said at the news conference that “the world has been inspired” by Ukraine in the war and that America will continue its support. “What you’ve done in repelling the Russians in the Battle of Kyiv is extraordinary,” he said.\n\nMr Zelensky had announced on Saturday that he would meet the US officials in Kyiv on Sunday, but Joe Biden’s administration refused to confirm that and declined to discuss details of a possible visit even though planning had been under way for more than a week.\n\nJournalists who travelled to Poland with Mr Austin and Mr Blinken were barred from reporting on the trip until it ended, were not allowed to accompany them on their overland journey into Ukraine, and were prohibited from specifying where in south-east Poland they waited for the Cabinet members to return. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon cited security concerns.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nSuch financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need.\n\nThe new money, along with the sale of 165 million dollars (£128 million) in non-US made ammunition that is compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use, takes the total amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to 3.7 billion dollars (£2.9 billion) since the invasion, officials said.\n\nUS officials said they believed the new assistance would satisfy at least some of the Ukrainians’ urgent pleas for more help. New artillery, including howitzers, continues to be delivered at a rapid pace to Ukraine’s military, which is being trained on its use in neighbouring countries, the officials said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\nMs Brink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the US Senate.\n\nMr Blinken also told Ukraine’s foreign minister that the small staff from the US embassy in Kyiv, which has relocated to Poland from temporary offices in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, will begin making day trips to Lviv in the coming days.\n\nOfficials said the US had accelerated its review of security conditions in the capital and that the State Department will reopen the embassy there as soon as the situation allows.\n\nMr Biden has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of genocide for the destruction and death wrought on Ukraine. On Thursday, the US leader said he would provide a new package of 800 million dollars (£623 million) in military aid to Ukraine that included heavy artillery and drones.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nFrom Poland, Mr Blinken plans to return to Washington while Mr Austin will head to Ramstein in Germany for a meeting Tuesday of Nato defence ministers and other donor countries.\n\nThat discussion will look at battlefield updates from the ground, additional security assistance for Ukraine and longer-term defence needs in Europe, including how to step up military production to fill gaps caused by the war in Ukraine, officials said. More than 20 nations are expected to send representatives to the meeting.', 'image': 'https://jerseyeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25144250/Img33212545-4.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:53'}

World Food Programme, David Beasley, has also warned us that the war in Ukraine will lead to the worst food crisis since World War II — and World Bank President David Malpass acknowledged this.\nWe will not accept a peace that Ukraine is forced to settle for because it has missiles pointed at it.', 'channel': 'politico.eu', 'text': 'Alar Karis is the president of Estonia.\n\nThe pink elephant that a little girl played with in a day care center just a month and a half ago lay covered in dust, in the ruins of a building destroyed by Russian bombs. In Borodyanka, near Kyiv — in the midst of the destruction and devastation — I and the presidents of the other Baltic states and Poland stood and stared at the ghastly face of war. I thought of my own children and grandchildren, and I was overwhelmed by sadness and grief.\n\nAs Europe, we failed. We failed because we were unable to dissuade Russian President Vladimir Putin from starting his war. And every town and village Russia now takes in Ukraine is part of our failure. Every Ukrainian hurt, killed or deported from their home adds to our failure, as do the millions of Ukrainian war refugees in every European country.\n\nIt is important that we start helping Ukraine more effectively, more visibly and more boldly. Russia’s goal is to destroy the existing Ukrainian state; our goal is to prevent that from happening. The time has come for us to shake off our fear and start making courageous decisions.\n\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter states that a U.N. member has the inherent right to individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against it. I emphasize the word “collective” because it underscores a very important point: Ukraine has the right to defend itself, and the rest of us, for whom the charter is an essential cornerstone of international relations, have a duty to help. This is what the collective self-defense of Ukraine means.\n\nWe must do everything we can to ensure Ukraine’s strong military resistance and the sanctions isolating Russia make the cost of the war so high for Moscow that it is eventually forced to back down.\n\nEconomic sanctions must be strong and effective, without exception, and for immediate implementation. This means some inconvenience for us, but just look at the footage of Ukrainian towns and villages after the departure of the Russian army. When we look into the face of Putin’s war, we realize that the inconveniences we experience under the umbrella of the European Union and NATO are nothing compared to the suffering of Ukrainians.\n\nIt’s time to embrace debates that involve thinking outside the box. We need an oil embargo, and we need it now. By paying Russia for energy, we continue to finance its war. Let us not forget that 60 percent of Russia’s oil exports are to Europe, and that last year, the Kremlin earned €180 billion from the sale of crude oil and petroleum products.\n\nAs for gas, Estonia has made a proposal to the EU, which is being referred to as “escrow”: Part of the payment for gas will be made directly to Russia, while the other part will be transferred to a separate account, frozen for Ukraine, which will be able to use it in the future to rebuild its destroyed nation. Gas cannot be put back into the ground, so there is no reason to fear that we will receive no gas if we implement this proposal.\n\nThe head of the U.N. World Food Programme, David Beasley, has also warned us that the war in Ukraine will lead to the worst food crisis since World War II — and World Bank President David Malpass acknowledged this. As such, we must discuss whether and how, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the U.N. Charter, we could provide direct support, upon the invitation of the Ukrainian government, to keep the port of Odesa open for Ukrainian grain ships.\n\nUkrainians say they have 20 million metric tons of grain in storage silos — probably 50 million with this year’s harvest — and if it remains in storage, there will be no sowing in the coming years. It is not possible to transport this quantity to the world market by rail — there is simply too much of it.\n\nWestern countries should establish a military presence in part of the Black Sea to ensure the safe movement of commercial and humanitarian aid vessels. Surely, some will argue against this and say that no one would take such a risk. But in the end, it is a question of our willingness to meet humanitarian needs. And where there is a will, there is a way.\n\nUkraine also needs weapons to defend itself, both those that its military knows how to use and more modern, effective weaponry that requires rapid training. We can offer them this training. As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its next phase, we should work more on the planning and coordination of military aid, helping to ensure that Ukraine’s most critical needs are met. This would truly be an effective signal of our unity.\n\nThe war in Europe affects us all; no one can ignore it. To do so would be to betray Europe. And only effective sanctions and Ukraine’s continued courage will eventually bring us to a point where Russia starts discussing a ceasefire in a meaningful and serious way. Only then will peace finally be possible.\n\nBut our goal must be a peace to which Ukrainians agree. We are not pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to give in, pushing the idea that a bad peace is still better than war. We will not accept a peace that Ukraine is forced to settle for because it has missiles pointed at it.\n\n“This war will only be won by Ukraine,” wrote Eero Epner, a well-known Estonian director and journalist, who visited Kyiv alongside myself and my fellow Polish and Baltic presidents. “But if it is lost, Ukraine will not be the one that loses it: we will be the ones who lose it.”\n\nWe cannot — we must not — lose.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25/GettyImages-1240213966-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:21'}

This issue of New Eastern Europe brings you some tales and reflections of the brave Ukrainians who have united to fight the invading aggressor.\n\nThese stories provide a distinct account – some of which are written in a diary format – of the first month of the war, the incredibly horrible period when Russian troops were brutally attacking villages on the road to Kyiv and elsewhere in the country. The disturbing images of the Russian inhumanity only emerged after the Ukrainians successfully defended the areas around the capital.\n\nThis issue also analyses the impact that the war has or will have on the region and beyond. Our authors examine the sanctions against Russia, the role of Belarus in the war, Poland’s new position as a frontline country as well as the future of Russia’s relations with the West. A significant development of the wartime has been not only the unity of the European Union and NATO but also the fact that all three countries known as the Associated Trio (Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia) have officially submitted applications to become members of the EU. These developments clearly demonstrate that the war has not only brought tragic results, but historical ones as well.\n\nLastly, the issue provides a look at the extraordinary level of human response to the war, including humanitarian activities and the welcoming of refugees. At New Eastern Europe we have been extremely involved in these actions as well, and have put a lot of focus on supporting our Ukrainian contributors and translators.

There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\'s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nIn a daily update on the conflict, Britain\'s defence ministry said Russia had only made minor advances in some parts of Donbas.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nIn an emotional address at Kyiv\'s 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral to mark the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday, Zelensky said his nation would overcome "dark times".\n\nWAR GRINDS ON\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country, where the war grinds on relentlessly.\n\nSome 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\nRussia also fired rockets at two towns in the central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\nUkraine\'s general staff described Russian shelling and assaults along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steel works in Mariupol where the last Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a city destroyed during two months of Russian siege and bombardment.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation", denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, Britain\'s The Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.', 'image': 'https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/04/25/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg/BINARY/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:37'}

The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nOn February 24th 2022 the world awoke to the news that the Russian Federation had begun a brutal invasion and attack from land, sea and air against independent and free Ukraine. That terrible winter morning confirmed that the evidence gathered by US intelligence and shared with the world weeks before was indeed correct. Russia’s large-scale military invasion was inevitable. It was to take place, despite our utter disbelief.\n\nRussia’s plan of mass aggression directed at the Ukrainian people could also have been gathered from the televised speech that Vladimir Putin delivered on February 21st, just a few days before the invasion. In this over one-hour-long gloomy talk to the Russian nation (and indeed the whole world), Putin bluntly declared his hatred of the former republics, now independent states, and bitterness over the collapse of the Soviet Union. The communist state’s breakup is for him, as we have long known, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. Today, it is crystal clear that Putin will not spare anything that humanity holds dear in order to restore the Russian empire and halt the NATO alliance from accepting new members.\n\nCowardice and denial\n\nThe brutality of the Russian army since the start of the invasion not only shows that Putin has no respect for international norms or human lives, but also that his own state – the Russian Federation – has become a repressive fascist system. The infamous letter “Z”, first painted on Russian military vehicles, has now become an explicit symbol of this fascism. But the truth is that Russia has been on the totalitarian path for quite some time now. We have just refused to accept this, naively believing that the lessons of the Second World War had been internalised long ago and its atrocities would never be repeated. This was especially true immediately after the Cold War, when it appeared that liberal democracy would prevail worldwide as part of the “end of history”.\n\nToday, when news about Russia’s hideous crimes against the Ukrainian nation reaches us daily, we have to admit that Russia acted in this way partly because of our own cowardice and denial. To put it honestly, it was us, the international community, that absolved the Russian Federation from accountability for its many brutal invasions in the past. These actions started with Moldova and Chechnya in the 1990s, then Georgia, Syria, Crimea and Donbas in the first and second decades of the 21st century. Like now in Ukraine, all these other places witnessed the Russian army commit crimes against humanity. Yet, instead of punishing those responsible for the atrocities in our international system of justice, we stood by, silently watching as the Kremlin ordered the murders of those who had openly opposed them in Russia and abroad.\n\nAmong those who were killed is Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered for informing the world on the reality of the Second Chechen War. Natalya Estemirova, a human rights activist, was also assassinated in Chechnya for similar reasons. We all remember the murder of Boris Nemtsov, who was killed for his reports on the Russian military intervention in Donbas. The closure of Memorial – an organisation that investigated Stalin’s brutal crimes – should have been no surprise as the totalitarian regime began closing its ranks internally.\n\nAnd while we may have been shocked by all these events and even expressed our anger publicly, we did very little to prevent them from happening again. Some in the West believed that these were even isolated incidents or that business with Russia did not necessarily mean business with those killers responsible for these horrible yet largely ignored crimes. Russian disinformation and propaganda fuelled ignorance and provided a cover for those who valued business over morals, and profits over lives.\n\nInformation pervasion\n\nRussia also gained a foothold in many of our own countries, often exploiting corrupt politicians and disseminating state-sponsored fake news and disinformation that inflamed internal divides. By allowing Russia Today, later RT, and Sputnik, primarily broadcast in English (the global lingua franca, but also translated into many other languages), to frequent our media landscape, we believed that we were adhering to our cherished democratic values like freedom of speech. Under the impression that these channels were offering “a different perspective”, we allowed Putin’s sick vision of restoring the Russian empire to take root in our societies and Kremlin-created narratives meant to divide us to enter into our discourse.\n\nThus, in 2014, instead of talking about the Russian war against Ukraine, we could read about a “civil conflict” in Ukraine; “the Ukrainian crisis”; and the problem of “Ukrainian nationalists”. These phrases, however, as many finally learnt in 2021 and 2022, were only to serve as a background for a much stronger lie. It was uttered by Putin himself and used as a pretext to start the current war. He falsely stated that Ukraine has no historical right to exist and even requires “denazification”.\n\nThe “denazification” of a state whose president is Jewish is obviously a groundless argument. Yet, we have to admit that many politicians in our own countries have long been under the influence of Russia. Thanks to this, we have witnessed many destructive trends that have severely damaged not only the operations of our state institutions and political processes, but also brought on deep divisions within our highly polarised societies. Almost any issue that requires a democratic choice has become prey to Russian manipulation via its disinformation machine, online trolls, bots and useful idiots. This is true for elections, but also COVID-19, Brexit, abortion rights, race relations, LGBTQ+ rights and many other issues. Instead of adequately diagnosing the sources of these divisions, we eagerly joined in; fanning the flames that were stoked by Russia’s interference. While we cannot blame Russia for everything wrong within our own societies, we do need to acknowledge all the risks it poses to our social cohesion through echo-chambers, bubbles and cancel culture.\n\nOur money also allowed Russia to grow. We nourished the monster in the Kremlin through vast and numerous business deals that we now find so difficult to free ourselves from. For some, business with Russia is still acceptable even if their daily news reports highlight the inhumane blockade of Mariupol and the shelling of breadlines in Kharkiv. Several EU member states remain prone to pressure from Russia, having ignored repeated calls for the diversification of their energy supply.\n\nWho provoked who?\n\nUnfortunately, there are still commentators, politicians and opinion makers in the West who continue to act as useful idiots for the Kremlin by claiming that it is NATO’s fault Russia invaded Ukraine. They say that NATO provoked the conflict and Russia is only acting in its own self-defence. Is Moscow defending itself by brutally killing civilians in the thousands? By destroying entire cities and forcibly moving their populations to various regions in Russia, including the Far East? How we can even point the finger at anyone else beyond Putin and his regime is still a deep-seated mystery. Besides, NATO does not “expand”; it has an “open door policy”. In other words, if a country wishes or decides that it is in its own best interests to join the Alliance, NATO will welcome them into the family after it conforms to the highest western standards. Seeing how Russia assaults those who even consider joining NATO, we should not doubt the importance of the Alliance. What if Poland did not decide to join NATO in 1999 and waited to announce such intentions until 2015? It would not take much imagination to fathom how Putin would have reacted in such a scenario. The argument that NATO provoked Russia is another example of the Russian narrative being regurgitated in mainstream western media. The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nNot that long ago, we were disgusted by the revelations in Alexei Navalny’s film about Putin’s mansion. But no one really bothered to speak up against the gas pipeline that allowed him to reach such levels of wealth. Many in the West in fact never felt obliged enough to see their business with Russia as an act of corruption. Yet many of them were eager to point to Ukraine as being corrupt and hence unable to “meet European democratic standards”. We expected Ukrainians to listen to our guidelines on what modern statehood should look like, but their arguments (or those in Poland or the Baltic states) on why Nord Stream 2 is dangerous for the region and our security went ignored, written off as wild “Russophobia”.\n\nNow, Europe and the West face their greatest challenge since the end of the Cold War and perhaps since the outbreak of the Second World War. The refugee crisis that the Russian forces have now set in motion through their indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine will be an immense and lengthy test. The tactics of total war have already forced a large percentage of Ukraine’s future beyond its borders. It must remain a priority for the international community to provide them with care and safety. Pushing these masses of civilians into Poland, Romania and Moldova in particular is also part of the Russian strategy to put these countries under pressure, sow divisions and exhaust resources. These countries and their allies must quickly come to terms with the fact that they are now on the frontline.\n\nTowards a common victory\n\nNow, of course, we have reached a stage of western unity and solidarity with Ukraine. The response by the transatlantic community to Russia’s invasion was impressive. Putin certainly did not expect such a reaction. A new emboldened sanctions regime has been introduced and Nord Stream 2 has finally been put on hold (yet for how long, we do not know). How this war will end depends on many factors. The brave and courageous Ukrainians defending their home, led and inspired by their democratically elected president, convince us that victory is not only possible but likely. However, peace at any cost cannot be the western-imposed solution to Putin’s war. Ukraine has already sacrificed too much. It has lost too many husbands, wives, sons, daughters and grandparents. Instead, peace can only come with Ukraine’s victory; its territorial integrity intact and its future bright and prosperous.\n\nThe Russian totalitarian regime must be held to account for its crimes in this war. This includes an end to Vladimir Putin’s rule in the Kremlin. A return to business as usual, drunk on Russian disinformation and corrupted by dirty money – to a place where we were before February 24th – is no longer possible. There is only one outcome: Ukraine’s victory and the renewal of the West and its promise of a new future. The price that Ukraine is paying today cannot and will not be made in vain. Understanding this is the first step towards our common victory.\n\nThis text was written by the editors of New Eastern Europe.', 'image': 'https://neweasterneurope.eu/new_site/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/editorial.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:01'}

Poland and Bulgaria would be the first countries to have their gas cut off by Europe\'s main supplier since Russia started what it calls a military operation in Ukraine on February 24. The move to cut off supplies also followed sanctions imposed by Poland against Russian individuals and companies. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that countries he terms "unfriendly" agree to a scheme under which they would open accounts at Gazprombank and make payments for Russian gas imports in euros or US dollars that would be converted into roubles. Poland is a staunch political opponent of Russia. Polish gas company PGNiG, whose gas deal with Russia expires at the end of this year, has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract. It also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland. Poland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year, and covers about 50 per cent of national consumption. Earlier, data from the European Union network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted but they resumed later on Tuesday. Poland\'s energy supplies were secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said on Tuesday, adding there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut. Gazprom also informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it would halt gas supplies from Wednesday, the energy ministry said. Bulgaria also had a contract due to expire at the end of the year. It meets more than 90 per cent of its gas needs with Gazprom\'s imports about 3 bcm a year. Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at data intelligence firm ICIS, said: "This is a seismic warning shot by Russia." "Poland has had an anti-Russia and anti-Gazprom stance for a number of years, which is not the case for Bulgaria, so to see Bulgaria also be cut off is also quite a development in its own right," he said. Bulgaria said it had taken steps to find alternative gas supply and no restrictions on gas consumption was required for now. Germany\'s network regulator said it was monitoring the gas delivery situation from Russia after the threat to Poland supplies, adding that supply to Germany was currently guaranteed.

For us, it\'s important to give the opportunity to those leaders who want to show their support of Ukraine by visiting Kyiv, to travel to Kyiv safe, and travel back safe," Kamyshin said.\n\nWatch video 02:41 Courageous rail workers keep Ukraine running amid war\n\nBiden names new US ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden has named Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine, the White House said in a statement.\n\nBridget Brink currently represents the United States in Slovakia.\n\nBrink\'s nomination must be confirmed by the US Senate.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that US diplomats would begin to return to Ukraine starting next week.\n\nWatch video 02:08 US pledges more arms funding for Ukraine\n\nNo southern Ukraine secession referendum plans — Russian Foreign Ministry\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry has denied claims that Moscow is planning a referendum on the secession of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson.\n\n"I have not heard anything about that," deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko told journalists.\n\nRudenko also said that a face-to-face meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers was not planned at present.

The ceasefire is set to begin at 2 p.m. Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Monday.\n\nThe ministry said any civilians trapped at the facility could leave in whichever direction they chose.\n\nOn April 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he cancelled plans to storm the Azovstal plant in Mariupol. He said he wanted the plant to be securely blockaded instead.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian fighters at the Azovstal plant reported heavy shelling and Russian attacks in recent days.\n\nAzovstal is the last remaining pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the key port of Mariupol.\n\nGermany\'s Steinmeier meets Ukrainian Holocaust survivors\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Ukrainian Holocaust survivors in Berlin and said that he hoped that refugees in Germany would feel safe from further attacks.\n\nSteinmeier met the survivors during a visit to a care facility in Berlin\'s eastern neighborhood of Marzahn.\n\nThe six Holocaust survivors told Steinmeier stories of their escape from Ukrainian cities, which in some cases lasted several days. The four women and two men were brought to Germany with the help of Jewish organizations.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the president\'s office, around 70 Holocaust survivors from Ukraine who are in need of serious care have so far been admitted in 11 German cities.\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Holocaust survivors in Berlin who fled Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia \'greeted\' Ukraine on Easter with missile strikes, Zelenskyy said\n\nIn a morning video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia "greeted" Ukraine with missiles strikes over the weekend, when Orthodox Easter was celebrated. The majority of population in both Russia and Ukraine are Orthodox Christians.\n\n"Why was this blow needed at Easter? There is no military threat from which this could protect Russia. This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the biggest Orthodox holiday," Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also spoke about yesterday\'s visit by top US officials. "Assistance to Ukraine was the number one issue in talks with representatives of the United States of America, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin," Zelenskyy said.\n\n"We share the same understanding with the United States: when democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world. When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world," said the Ukrainian president.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskyy also mentioned the morning air raids in the Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv and Odesa regions. However, he did not provide any information on the rocket attacks reported at train stations in western Ukraine.\n\nUkraine reports deadly rocket attacks in central Vinnytsia region\n\nTwo towns in Ukraine\'s central Vinnytsia region came under fire on Monday, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, according to local officials.\n\nThe cities of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn were struck by "rocket fire," local governor Serhiy Borzov said on Facebook. The attacks reportedly targeted "critical infrastructure" in the region, he said. Both cities are important railway junctions on the route from Kyiv to western Ukraine.\n\nBorzov also said the strikes caused deaths and injuries, but he did not give any numbers.\n\nRailway stations struck by missiles — Ukrainian railway chief\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine have been hit by missile strikes, according to the head of the country\'s railways, Oleksandr Kamyshin.\n\n"Russian forces are systematically destroying the infrastructure of our railways," Kamyshin said on his Telegram channel.\n\nKamyshin added that trains are being forced to alter routes and schedules for security reasons.\n\nReports of missile attacks also emerged in the western city of Lviv and southwestern city of Vinnytsia.\n\nAccording to Maksym Kozytskyy, the governor of the western Lviv region, an explosion occurred on Monday morning at the traction substation of the Krasne railway station as a result of a missile strike.\n\nOne missile was destroyed by Ukrainian air defense. The missiles flew to western Ukraine from the southeast, Kozytskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe added that the missiles were likely fired from Russian strategic aircraft. He had no information yet about possible victims.\n\nKyiv needs long-range fires and tanks — US Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed and that Kyiv now needs long-range fires for both artillery and missiles, as well as tanks.\n\nAustin said that he and Blinken had discussed "security assistance" and "training" with Ukrainian officials. He said that the meeting was to talk about things that would "enable us to win the current fight and also build for tomorrow."\n\n"We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," Austin said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke to reporters following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nAustin is scheduled to go to the Ramstein US Air Base in western Germanyon Tuesday to speak with allies on how best to support Ukraine.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense said it is difficult for the US to track what happens to weapons transferred to Ukraine as there are no US forces on the ground, but added that he spoke to Kyiv to make sure weapons were tracked as best as possible.\n\nRussia \'failing\' in its war aims — Blinken\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press conference following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Russia has been "failing" when it came to its war aims in Ukraine, while Kyiv is "succeeding."\n\n"Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine," Blinken said. "That has failed."\n\nBlinken said that Russia\'s military was underperforming and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin\'s on the scene," Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees "final success."\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "things are beginning to get back to normal" in Kyiv, but noted that "that\'s in stark contrast to what\'s going on" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas — UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain\'s defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, "Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. Britain\'s defense ministry believes this "reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia\'s losses from the domestic population."\n\nWatch video 01:57 Ukraine war: Russia\'s renewed ambitions in the east\n\nRussia increased military spending to $65.9 billion in 2021\n\nWorld military expenditure surpassed the $2 trillion mark (€1.8 trillion) for the first time in 2021, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe report released on Monday shows Russia increased its military expenditure to $65.9 billion in 2021 to reach 4.1% of its GDP.\n\nIt was the third consecutive year of growth and Russia\'s military spending. Moscow was the fifth largest spender in the world, behind the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nUkraine\'s military spending has risen by 72% since Russia\'s annexation of Crimea in 2014. It spent $5.9 billion, or 3.2% of the country\'s GDP, in 2021.\n\nTotal spending in Europe in 2021 amounted to $418 billion, 3% higher than in 2020 and 19% higher than in 2012. Many European countries have contributed substantial military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, and third-largest spender Germany boosted its military aid budget to €2 billion a little over a week ago.\n\nThe United States saw a drop in expenditure in 2021 due to a drop in American spending on research and development. The US is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, having provided an additional $800 million in mid-April and another $322 million this Sunday.\n\nWatch video 02:24 US approves more military aid to Ukraine\n\nBlinken and Austin announce aid, diplomatic surge\n\nThe United States will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military financing and has approved a $165 million sale of ammunition to the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe announcement came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt was the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war.\n\nThe US officials also pledged further assistance worth $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries, with the $322 million earmarked specifically for Kyiv.\n\nThe new money brings the total amount of US military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said.\n\nThe two returned overland to Poland after their meeting. While Blinken was returning to Washington, Austin would head to Ramstein in Germany, for a meeting Tuesday of NATO defense ministers and other donor countries.\n\nWatch video 03:37 Zelenskyy hopes US Foreign and Defense Ministers bring promises of weapons: DW\'s Rebecca Ritter\n\nFire at Russian oil depot north of Ukrainian border\n\nA large fire was reported at an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk. The emergency services ministry told Russian news agencies it was a single large fire.\n\nIt was not immediately not clear how the fire started. Bryansk is located about 380 kilometers (236 miles) southwest of Moscow.\n\nThe city is the administrative center of the Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials on Thursday had said Ukrainian helicopters hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the Bryansk region.\n\nThere was no immediate indication the fire on Monday at the oil storage facility was related to the war in Ukraine.\n\nEU considering \'smart sanctions\' against Russian oil\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, the UK newspaper The Times reported.\n\nQuoting the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis, the paper reported that the precise details of the oil sanctions had not yet been agreed but could include a gradual phasing-out of Russian oil or imposing tariffs on imports beyond a certain price cap.\n\n"We are working on a sixth sanctions package, and one of the issues we are considering is some form of an oil embargo. When we are imposing sanctions, we need to do so in a way that maximizes pressure on Russia while minimizing collateral damage on ourselves," Dombrovskis said.\n\nEurope spends around $450 million (€417 million) per day on Russian crude oil and refined products.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand show support for Ukraine at ANZAC Day commemorations\n\nThe leaders of Australia and New Zealand used their annual speeches on Anzac Day to show support for Ukraine.\n\nAnzac Day marks the anniversary of Australian and New Zealand soldiers landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in 1915 during World War I but is now used to commemorate troops from all conflicts.\n\n"The invasion of Ukraine is a senseless act of war, one that is taking the lives of innocent people. It is a threat to the international laws that a nation like ours relies on — but it is also a threat to our sense of humanity. And that makes it a threat to all of us," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said\n\nNew Zealand was physically distanced from the conflict but "inextricably linked" to what it represented, Ardern added.\n\nAcross the Tasman sea, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the people of Ukraine, who are fighting a Russian invasion.\n\n"On this particular day, as we honor those who fought for our liberty and freedom, we stand with the people of Ukraine who do the same thing at this very moment," Morrison said.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nSummary of Sunday\'s events in Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv. A senior Ukrainian official confirmed the meeting. Zelenskyy was expected to push Washington for more powerful weapons.\n\nRussia\'s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol. Ukraine\'s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing "offensive operations" at the Azovstal steel plant.\n\nThe UN refugee agency said 5,186,744 Ukrainians have fled since the start of Russia\'s invasion, an increase of 23,058 on Saturday\'s figures.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has said it is "extremely concerned" after several of its Ukrainian members were believed to have been arrested in pro-Russian separatist territories in the country\'s east. In a tweet, the organization said it was using all available channels to facilitate their release.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defense said Russia was planning a "staged referendum in the southern city of Kherson aimed at justifying its occupation." In 2014, Russia held a sham referendum in Crimea to retrospectively justify its annexation of the territory.\n\ndh, si, lo/sri,rs (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61578306_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:58:42'}

Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said during a visit to Kosovo that Hungary had no plans to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine. In addition, Hungary does not allow their transit to Kiev, as they "could become targets to hostile military actions".\n\n"We are not getting involved in this war," the minister explained.\n\nIncidentally, a group of German public figures wrote an open letter to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz calling for arms shipments to Ukraine to end, as this "drags Germany into war".\n\n"By supplying weapons, Germany and other NATO countries have de facto made themselves a party to the war.

Kyiv won 3-2 in a charity match played in front of about 35,000 fans. All proceeds will go to victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n"It is about sending a signal, a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, earning a bit of money so that we can do one or the other humanitarian action. And then it is also a sign against this despicable war of aggression," Dortmund managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke told broadcasters ZDF.\n\nKyiv has played similar fund-raising matches in Warsaw, Istanbul and Cluj.\n\nPutin claims he hopes for diplomatic agreement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Moscow. In televised remarks, he told Guterres that he still hoped for negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject [talks]," Putin told Guterres, who was visiting Moscow.\n\nHe said talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv. He claimed without evidence, that the massacres in Bucha were not carried out by Russians.\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nGuterres reiterated his call for Ukraine and Russia to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe broadcast discussions showed Guterres and Putin sitting opposite each other at the large oval table in the hall of the Senate Palace, following an hour-long meeting in the Kremlin.

It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense. Speaking at the event, Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense, told reporters that "we have to move at the speed of war."\n\nAustin said the US was determined to make better use of the US European Command\'s coordination mechanism and would extend the forum for Ukraine\'s defense into a monthly contact group.\n\n"We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and make it less able to do that," Austin said.\n\nAustin went on to express sharp criticism of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who warned on Monday that World War III might be looming.\n\n"You\'ve heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful," Austin said. "Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence.

This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing. Mantoo added that Syria has the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled the country.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nUN doubles Ukraine aid appeal to $2.25 billion\n\nThe United Nations\' humanitarian agency (UN OCHA) said that it has been forced to double its aid appeal to $2.25 billion (€2.11 billion) as the humanitarian situation in the country worsens.\n\n"Over $2.25 billion is now required for needs inside Ukraine, more than double of the amount requested ($1.1 billion) when we launched the appeal on 1 March, a few days after the war began," the UN OCHA said in a statement.\n\nUS, allies will \'move heaven and Earth\' to meet Ukrainian security requirements — Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the aim of the conference at the air base in Ramstein, Germany was to "help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion," as well as to "build up Ukraine\'s defenses for tomorrow\'s challenges."\n\nAustin said that he discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Kyiv\'s "changing requirements" as Russia focuses on Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.

The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes. Russia\'s Defense Ministry claimed it used missiles to destroy facilities powering the railways supplying Ukrainian forces with foreign weapons.\n\nAbout 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. Ukraine has claimed 22,000 Russian troops were killed since the invasion. Russia has acknowledged only 1,351 military deaths.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalize parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims.\n\nAfter a visit to Kyiv, Blinken said Russia\'s military was underperforming, and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nWatch video 02:54 Russian missiles strike Ukrainian rail stations\n\nYou can revisit our live updates from April 25 here.\n\nsi, lo, aw/wmr, rs, mhm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61602081_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:19'}

Russia is also proving that energy resources are a weapon. That is why the EU needs to be united and impose an embargo on energy resources, depriving the Russians of their energy weapons.”\n\nThe move will be a grave concern to those countries who are the most heavily dependent on Russian gas, such as Germany, but at a hastily arranged press conference, Polish ministers said they had sufficient supplies to weather an interruption while accusing Gazprom of a breach of contract.\n\nAnna Moskwa, Poland’s minister for climate, said: “There are no worries about shortages of gas in our homes. It is worth pointing out that liquified natural gas alone supplies the market sufficiently. LNG deliveries in [terminal] Świnoujście are growing – in 2015 there was one, in 2021 it was already 35. As of today, it provides for about 50 deliveries.”\n\nShe added: “Appropriate diversification strategies that we have introduced allow us to feel on the safe side in this situation.”\n\nPGNiG, Poland’s largest gas supplier, said it would file a breach of contract lawsuit over Gazprom’s decision.\n\nRussia currently supplies about 55% of Poland’s annual demand of about 21bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas but the country’s government has still been pushing the EU and other western allies to go further in punishing the Kremlin.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Bulgaria’s energy ministry said it had been told that supplies of Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline would also cease on Wednesday.\n\nOnce a close ally of Moscow, Bulgaria has cut many of its ties with Russia, supporting sanctions against Russia and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\nPrime Minister Kiril Petkov and members of his coalition government were due to travel to Kyiv on Wednesday for aid talks with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Balkan country meets more than 90% of its gas needs with Russian imports, but the government insisted that no restrictions would be imposed on domestic gas consumption would be imposed for.\n\nThe NGO Europe Beyond Coal has calculated that the EU has sent more than €41bn (£34.7bn) to Russia in payments for fossil fuels since it invaded Ukraine two months ago.\n\nPoland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, had already said he intended to ban Russian gas and oil imports by the end of the year and there has been a move to diversify to cover for losses.\n\nThe key Yamal pipeline carries natural gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, through Belarus. But the Polish government had made a clear move away from dependency by constructing a liquefied natural gas terminal in the Baltic port of Świnoujście, run by Qatari and US companies, which is capable of handling 5 bcm of gas. It is being expanded to 7.5 bcm by 2023.\n\nThe extent to which Polish industry will be able to rely on this flow is yet to be seen, however, and other countries will be worried about the development.\n\nMoscow had warned clients in March that they risked having their gas supplies cut unless they paid in roubles.\n\nThe European Commission had nevertheless said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars.\n\nThe only EU leader who has suggested he would pay Gazprom in roubles is Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, whose rightwing government has pursued a close relationship with Putin’s regime for over a decade.\n\nThe move by the Kremlin comes as EU member states are drawing up a sixth wave of sanctions that could include imposing a ceiling on the price paid for Russian oil.\n\nBut there remains a reluctance in Berlin, in particular, to go hard on gas imports given the German economy’s dependence on Russia in that field.\n\nIn early April, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told the Bundestag that the country’s energy reliance had “grown over decades and cannot be ended from one day to the next”, given that it would lead to the rationing of energy to industry and the potential closure of its largest factories.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gazprom denied that gas flows to Poland had been stopped. Spokesperson Sergei Kupriyanov said: “Today Poland has to pay for gas supplies according to the new payment procedure.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/420e247b8a553addda3a467a546bd7b9ad9b5477/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ae70b85c18886bd10a227f8648798a1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:05'}

Click here for updates from April 24.\n\nMariupol Officials Say New Mass Grave Found\n\nOfficials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new mass grave has been identified north of the city.\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) north of Mariupol.\n\nSatellite photos released over the past several days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nMariupol has been decimated by fierce fighting over the past two months. The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk.

Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:40'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war.

Unsurprisingly, many of these efforts have often been penetrated due to the poor and blatant construction exposed by the mainstream Western mass media that perhaps interact closely with the intelligence circles.\n\nBut this hardly means that Western governments and the mass media are bona fide disseminators of war information that is free from distortion and manipulation. This is because, in the modern and contemporary history of war, government propaganda is a commonplace. It is instrumental to mobilize, sustain and strengthen domestic and international support for war efforts, particularly when magnified by mass media. An underdog country can use such propaganda to enhance international support, especially through provision of weapons, ammunition, logistics and, if feasible, reinforcements, to complement its inferior war capability, as well as economic sanction against the top dog country. On the other hand, the latter can employ such a propaganda to enhance popular morale and supplement resource mobilization capacity.\n\nIn fact, Western government war propaganda and the mainstream mass media reports have established a predominant international opinion that sides sympathetically with Ukraine as the innocent underdog[i]. This is particularly because numerous video footage has lively covered massive exoduses of Ukrainian women and children to neighboring countries, missile bombardment and other forms of shelling against urban residential areas, and vivid images of killed and injured noncombatants as well as combatants, among others. Unfortunately, timely open-source information on evolving operational and tactical realities is limited, partial, unbalanced and/or, biased, possibly with intentional distortions and manipulations. Yet, the reports seem to prove atrocities committed by the Russian invasion forces, demonizing these forces and President Vladimir Putin at the levels of jus ad bellum and jus in bello.\n\nYet, war propaganda becomes unplausible and ineffective, especially when detached from evolving battlefield realities. Until then, war propaganda surely hampers coolheaded analysis and appropriate policy prescription on how to end a war, while unnecessarily protracting warfare involving a significantly higher death toll and further destruction.\n\nIn this light, this study will cast some different light on the tenability of the predominant factual recognition and discourse in mainstream Western mass media. The first jus in bello cases are about Western allegation of atrocities committed by the Russian side against Ukrainian non-combatants, particularly under the condition of extremely fierce urban warfare in the cities of Mariupol and Bucha. The second jus ad bellum case is about Russian allegation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine. These cases are particularly important because most of Western news and reports have flatly turned down Russian counterparts as misinformation and disinformation, without any serious examination. Certainly, the current author of this piece does not enjoy any privileged access to classified information but only to open sources. Yet, careful examination of open-source materials, including Russian and alternative media sources, may make it possible to identify blind assumptions and invalid judgements in the current dominant Western discourse, if not to present correct facts and cogent judgements.\n\n1. The Mariupol Case\n\n1) The Context\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky stated in his on-line speech of March 23 to the Japanese Diet that several thousand Ukrainian civilians, including 121 children, had been killed, together with nine millions refugees and internally displaced civilians[ii]. This unexpectedly low level of death toll may indicate that Russian invasion forces exercised certain self-restraint in attacking civilians, except collateral damage.\n\nIn fact, Douglas Macgregor[iii], a retired U.S. Army Colonel and a Senior Advisor to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, stated that, despite the strong impression generated by the repeated exposure to video footage, President Putin strictly ordered from the outset of the war to avoid killing civilians and destroying urban areas as much as possible[iv]. This is consistent with his historical outlook on the triune Russian national identity – White, Little and Great Russians (respectively, Belarussians, Ukrainians and Russians), characterized by strong historical unity and brotherhood[v]. Naturally ,it begs the question of why the Russian forces killed many Ukrainian civilians and severely destroyed urban residential areas in Ukraine, involving an inscrutable disjunction between Putin’s own creed and practice.\n\nExtremely fierce urban warfare, especially in the City of Mariupol, is a natural consequence of the stark disparity of Russian and Ukrainian military power, to which both sides have even introduced foreign volunteer fighters and mercenaries[vi]. With its overwhelming superiority, the Russian invasion forces neutralized a significant portion of main high-end platforms, assets and on-ground facilities of the Ukrainian armed forces at the initial stage of the current war, including air superiority fighters, major battle tanks and the command & control systems[vii]. This is consistent with numerous video footage available in public domain that primarily captures Ukrainian infantry operations with portable anti-tank missiles for close combat and low-altitude anti-air missiles, while few high-end platforms are visible. In fact, the Russian Defense Ministry said that, soon after the start of the war, the Russian forces totally destroyed Ukrainian Air Force combat aircraft while some of them escaped to Poland and Romania[viii]. Reportedly, the Russia forces destroyed 974 Ukrainian tanks and other armored vehicles just for the first three weeks[ix]. No wonder, MacGregor judged that the Ukrainian units still active “(were) completely surrounded, cut off and isolated in various town and cities”, with supplies likely running out soon[x]. Ukrainian infantry and special operation forces in Mariupol were cornered at bay without reinforcement nor air cover. An Azov Battalion commander there vainly urged the U.S.-led NATO to make armed intervention against Russia, especially to set an effective no-fly zone over Ukraine, while attributing a grave humanitarian crisis in the making to Russia。[xi]\n\n2) Who attacked the maternity hospital and the drama theater?\n\nThe Ukrainian government strongly condemned Russia for its military attack against a maternity hospital in Mariupol on March 17[xii], which injured 17 people including women, children and doctors, with at least five of them dead thereafter[xiii]. But Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov justified the attack because an Azov Battalion unit turned the hospital to a combat base[xiv], claiming the victims as unavoidable and lawful collateral damage. Surprisingly, the pregnant woman on spotlight in the reports later disclosed that Ukrainian soldiers used the hospital as base while holding these civilians as human shield against Russian forces, suggesting that the incident was an act of self-destruct and a false flag operation by the Ukraine’s side[xv]. This is compatible with other fragmentary video footage that capture how Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol have been used as human shield[xvi] and prevented from leaving the city[xvii].\n\nAlso, the Ukrainian government alleged, echoed aloud by major Western mass media, that, on March 16, a Russian airstrike dropped a powerful bomb on the Mariupol Drama Theater sheltering some 1,300 local residents, including women and children, and despite large signs of “children” that were clearly visible from aircraft. Reportedly, the death toll reached at least to 300[xviii]. The Russian government flatly denied the allegation and instead accused the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, of blowing up the theater building. This is compatible with the interview of a 17- year-old female survivor of the incident with the Abkhazian Network News Agency, who eye-witnessed Azov soldiers hiding themselves behind civilian hostages in the building[xix].\n\nMore specifically, a Russian military spokesman stated that Azov Battalion units held civilian hostages in the theater building as human shield, using the upper floor as firing points. This means that the Russian attack aimed at these units, involving significant civilian casualties as collateral damage during the engagement[xx]. This is a plausible account on what happened, particularly given the very similar circumstances of the above hospital case.\n\nIt is now crucially important to inquire what the Azov Battalion is all about and if the troop has the established notoriety of committing such atrocities.\n\n3）The Azov Battalion[xxi]\n\nThe Azov Battalion is now a part of the Ukrainian National Guard, which is the country’s gendarmerie under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Its name originates from the fact that it has been based in Mariupol in the Azov Sea costal region since 2014, first as a volunteer militia that fought against Russian separatist forces in the Donbas War and later in the same year incorporated into the National Guard while expanded in scale into a regiment. As Russia labels it as neo-Nazis, it in fact uses controversial symbols resembling the Nazis SS Wolfsangel, though it denies any connection with Nazism[xxii]. Yet, in 2015, an Azov spokesman disclosed 10-20% of units consisted of neo-Nazis members[xxiii]. The concern over the Azov is serious enough to the extent that the U.S. Congress enacted a legislative measure, Consolidated Appropriation Bill of 2018, to ban military aids to the paramilitary due to its white supremacist ideology and neo-Nazism[xxiv].\n\nThe Azov has faced serious allegations of committing torture and war crimes, including the grossly underinvestigated case of the 2014 Odessa Clashes in which some 50 pro-Russia separatists were killed[xxv]. In fact, the U.N. Human Rights Office of High Commissioner published reports that connect the Azov Battalion to war crimes such as mass looting, unlawful detention, and torture[xxvi]. Clearly. Russia’s counter-allegations on the above atrocities in Mariupol are at least compatible with an established understanding on Azov’s behavioral pattern connected to war crimes.\n\nActually, Russia’s emphasis and Western de-emphasis on the Azov Battalion is obscurely central to their intensified exchanges of war propaganda and counter-propaganda, on the ground that the paramilitary has constituted a major U.S instrument of covert military intervention in Russia-Ukraine armed conflict. More specifically, the CIA had a secret advisory and training program for Ukrainian paramilitaries and militias, most probably including the Azov, for eight years until shortly before the start of the current war, despite the aforementioned legislative ban. The CIA has had training centers in the U.S. and eastern Ukraine for sniper techniques[xxvii], anti-tank missile handling, covert communications, and other tactics necessary for insurgency and counter-insurgency[xxviii]. Thus, the issue of the Azov Battalion cannot simply be reduced to the question of war crimes, but can only be fully comprehended in the context of a U.S.-Russia proxy war over the Donbas region that is central to NATO expansion to Ukraine and determination of their spheres of interest.\n\n2. The Bucha Case\n\nA similar suspicion of war propaganda is not easily excludable, with a focus on the atrocities allegedly committed by the Russian armed forces against local Ukrainian civilians in the city of Bucha. Major Western governments and the mainstream mass media are condemning, with strongest terms, the unspeakable atrocities against local Ukrainian civilians on the way of retreat after hard battles to vainly capture Kiev. However, on March 31 when the Russian forces left the city, its mayor did not at all mention of the atrocities in an interview with a Ukrainian on-line news site[xxix] which is compatible with his bright expression in a selfie video taken on the same day[xxx]. On April 2, when Ukrainian army forces entered the city to make sure of a complete retreat of the Russian forces, the video footage by a local news media captured no corpse on roads and no sign of emotional distress among the local population. On April 1, Azov Battalion troops entered the city[xxxi], and on April 3, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense released video footage as evidence of the atrocities committed by the Russian forces, which neither the New York Times nor the Pentagon are independently able to verify the assertion of the Ministry[xxxii]. In addition, in the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. and the U.K. blocked Russia’s proposal to send an independent fact-finding mission to Ukraine[xxxiii].\n\nThus, there is a good possibility that the Azov Battalion might have fabricated or purposefully committed at least some parts of the “atrocities” by itself[xxxiv]. (More specifically, to differentiate which camp they belong, pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian civilians wear blue or white armbands respectively. Many corpses in Bucha wore white armbands as in video footage available. The Azov and/or other ultra-right militia units may have committed the atrocities out of emotional impulse, while the mass media and propaganda section of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs may have made up the scene to impute responsibilities of war crime to the Russian invasion forces[xxxv]. It should be reminded that the current war has the dimension of ethnic conflict as well as that of inter-state war.)\n\nGiven the leading role of BBC reports on this matter with the analysis of a satellite image, this begs the question of if the U.K. intelligence circles are engaged in elaborate war propaganda against Russia to mislead and manipulate other major Western governments and mass media[xxxvi].\n\n3. The Case of Biological Weapon R&D\n\nPossession of weapon of mass destruction by a revisionist power may constitute a casus belli of a status quo power, particularly when the latter sees the former’s move as its existential threat or serious threat against its vital national interests. Yet, legitimatizing a war has to satisfy some procedural requirements according to international law with presentation of solid evidence to the international society.\n\nIn this light, Russia’s allegation on Ukraine’s nuclear weapon programs is not tenable at all, at least at this point, due to its abrupt aggression against Ukraine without presenting any substantial evidence[xxxvii]. Also, there are little significant related information in public domain, though Ukraine has active nuclear power plants with some substantial potential to develop nuclear weapons as the country was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nBut Russia’s accusation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine, as articulated with a trove of original documentation by Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, Commander of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troop of the Russian Army[xxxviii], is not totally deniable but seems plausible with open-source information[xxxix]. Most remarkably, Victoria Nuland, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, admitted the existence of biolaboratories in Ukraine under the bilateral cooperative programs of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency during a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations[xl], while the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department unequivocally denied U.S.-funded biological weapon laboratories in Ukraine[xli]. In addition, an official letter from an official in charge at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to a project manager of Black & Veatch, a DTRA contractor, attests to their significant collaborative research relationship, while another official letter from an official in charge at the DTRA office in Kiev to an official in charge at the Ukraine Ministry Defense indicates their clear awareness of the potential usefulness of their research collaboration for biological weapon development[xlii].\n\nCertainly, the Agency’s Biological Threat Reduction Programs may serve bona fide statutory purposes, not designed to contribute to virus and other biological weapon R&D. Yet, suspicion remains, given that the offense and defense of biological warfare is generally the head and tail of similar biological weapon technologies while there is no clear demarcation line between military and civil research in most advanced virus and other biological R&D that involves genetic manipulation. The lack of confidence in the sectoral culture has recently become worse because Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the President Biden, hid the fact before a Senate hearing that the EcoHealth Alliance, New York City-based nonprofit organization, funneled U.S. public funds to gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses at China’s Wuhan lab, making it feasible to bypass stringent domestic regulations and strict public eyes. The experiment is suspected potentially useful for biological weapon R&D, and a virus leak from the lab might have been a primary cause of the current COVIT-19 pandemic[xliii].\n\n4. Reflection\n\nHitherto, this investigative inquiry has cast significant doubt and suspicion on the established Western discourse that sided uncritically with Ukraine in its war against hyper-demonized Russia, almost exclusively on the basis of Western government war information and mass media reports, and without carefully checking Russian reports.\n\nOf course, Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine is utterly indisputable, and a great number of innocent Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the current war, either in atrocity or collateral damage. But who killed how many civilians and in what ways is not self-evident as reported in the Western media, especially in the context of ethnic conflict and urban warfare as the world learnt from gross information manipulation in the former Yugoslavia ethnic conflict[xliv]. It is increasingly necessary to check Western reports carefully against Russian ones, while verifying the authenticity of allegedly “original” U.S. documents presented by the Russian government and mass media. The U.S. government will be accountable, if verified.\n\nInundated with propaganda and counter-propaganda both by the West and Russia day after day, both political leaders and the public in the West will suffer self-poisoning effect of the hyper-demonized image of Russia on making coolheaded policy analysis. It is high time that the Western governments and mainstream mass media recalibrate war propaganda and counter-propaganda, in view of the need to think of how to end the current war and to keep diplomatic channels open with Russia that would most unlikely capitulate, given that it is a nuclear power coequal to the United States.\n\n[i] Despite the current image of an innocent victim, Ukraine has continually played a disturbing role to Asian and international security, particularly because it sold an ex-Soviet aircraft career, Varyag, as scrap to China, that has been already repaired and commissioned as the country’s first aircraft career, Liaoning; and because Ukraine has not effectively banned outflows of ballistic missile technologies to North Korea that has significantly contributed to the development of its nuclear weapon programs.

EU countries have largely refused that demand, saying it breaks contracts denominated in dollars and euros.\n\nThe European Commission said that such payments would violate EU sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nPGNiG said it continued "to settle its liabilities for natural gas delivered under the Yamal Contract in accordance with its current terms."\n\nThe Polish utility demanded that Gazprom resume gas deliveries. If that doesn\'t happen, it warned: "the Company reserves the right to claim damages."\n\n"There is no contractual basis for the suspension of the supply of the gas delivered under the Yamal Contract," PGNiG said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Gazprom spokesperson Sergey Kupriyanov told reporters in Moscow: "Poland is obliged to pay for gas supplies in accordance with the new payment procedure," according to the official TASS news agency.\n\nBulgaria also balked at the demand to pay in rubles. The new Russian payment system is "at odds with the agreement that is effective until the end of this year and poses considerable risks for the Bulgarian side," said the energy ministry.\n\nPoland has vowed to end imports of Russian coal, gas and oil, and is pressing other EU countries to rapidly do the same.\n\n"We are prepared for the complete cut off of Russian fossil fuels," Polish Energy Minister Anna Moskwa said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nPoland gets 46 percent of its gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia, according to Forum Energii, a think tank.\n\nPolish authorities insisted that the cutoff won\'t affect gas users.\n\n"Thanks to the implementation of the government\'s strategy of diversifying gas supply sources, PGNiG is prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on the western and southern borders and the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście," said PGNiG.\n\nMoskwa said: "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security," adding that the country\'s gas storage was 80 percent full. She said Poland will continue to buy gas on European and international markets and aims to fill its reserves to 100 percent.\n\nBulgaria, which gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia, said it has "taken steps to ensure alternative supplies of natural gas and handle the situation. Measures to restrict consumption in Bulgaria are unnecessary at this stage."\n\nPoland\'s 1996 agreement with Gazprom expires at the end of the year, and Warsaw has said it won\'t be renewed. Piotr Naimski, in charge of strategic energy infrastructure, said that Poland was already planning to end Russian gas supplies, and that Tuesday\'s decision by Gazprom "speeds that up."\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, news that gas flows from Russia to Poland showed a precipitous decline caused spot gas prices to spike. Month-ahead gas contracts on the EU benchmark TTF trading hub in the Netherlands rose from €91 per megawatt-hour to €107/MWh around 4:30 p.m. before settling back to €99/MWh.\n\nThis article has been updated to add that Gazprom will also stop shipments to Bulgaria.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26/GettyImages-1368239012.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:26'}

But Johnson insisted that the West did not need to make concessions despite the nuclear threat.\n\n“People say we have to make a concession, we have to worry about what Putin might do because of the risk of his defeat,” Johnson said. “I think he has got a lot of space, he has got a lot of room for manoeuvre.”\n\n10:02pm: Gazprom has informed Bulgaria, Poland of halt to gas supplies from Wednesday\n\nRussia’s Gazprom has informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it will halt gas supplies as of Wednesday, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ministry said that along with state gas companies it has taken steps to find alternative arrangements for the supply of natural gas and to deal with the situation.\n\nIt said for the time being no restrictions in the gas consumption in the Balkan country which meets over 90 percent of its gas needs with Gazprom’s imports, were required.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Polish officials had said Russia is suspending natural gas deliveries to Poland beginning Wednesday morning after that country refused a demand to pay for its supplies in Russian rubles\n\nPoland’s state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Russian gas giant Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop on Wednesday.\n\nPolish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources.

We are negotiating, we do not reject (talks)," Putin told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was visiting Moscow, in televised remarks.\n\nSitting across from Guterres at a long table at the Kremlin, Putin said efforts at talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, speaks to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting in the Kremlin, in Moscow, Russia, on April 26, 2022. © Vladimir Astapkovich, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nPutin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia\'s military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.\n\nGuterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (see 2:02pm, below) for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\n6:45pm: Blinken says Putin not \'serious\' about Ukraine diplomacy\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the Ukraine war, despite a series of international efforts.\n\n“We’ve seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: “Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table.”\n\nBlinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlinken hailed what he saw on the trip and said that the US was speeding up arms deliveries, with the process now often taking only 72 hours after Ukraine sends requests.\n\n6:10pm: Germany confirms plans to send Ukraine tanks, in policy shift\n\nGermany said Tuesday it would send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a clear switch in Berlin’s cautious policy on military backing for Kyiv that was welcomed by the United States.\n\nThe government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the US Ramstein airbase.\n\nThe move comes after heavy criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to Ukraine, despite announcing a “turning point” in German defence policy in response to Russia’s invasion.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the pledge to send “some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems”, the English name for the weapons, was “especially welcome”.\n\n5:19pm: US Defence Secretary says US, allies to meet monthly on arming Ukraine\n\nThe United States and its allies will meet once a month to discuss Ukraine\'s defence needs to battle invading Russian troops, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.\n\n"Today\'s gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine\'s self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\n4:53pm: FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg on the fallout over blasts in Transnistria, Moldova\n\n02:48 © FRANCE 24\n\n4:08pm: Putin, Erdogan discuss humanitarian corridors in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow’s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin statement, the leaders in a phone call talked about “efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors”.\n\nThis came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.\n\nThe Kremlin said Erdogan asked Putin about the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe Russian leader told him that “the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there”.\n\n3:09pm: Nearly 5.3 million flee Ukraine war as refugees, up more than 32,000 since Monday\n\nNearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.\n\nIn total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 32,753 over Monday\'s figure.\n\nWhile the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday (see 11:31am, below) that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.\n\n2:02 pm: Guterres says Russia, UN have \'very different\' views of events in Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had "very frank" discussions with Lavrov. He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol.

Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy.

But the Ukrainians, aided by Western weapons, bogged down President Vladimir Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its focus is in the eastern region of the Donbas, but one senior military official says it also wants to control southern Ukraine.

No cause was given for the blaze.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries.\n\nA Russian news report said that another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire early Monday.\n\nIn footage later released by the Ukrainian presidency of the meeting with top US officials, Mr Blinken praised the “extraordinary courage and leadership and success that you’ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression”.\n\nMr Austin said at the news conference that “the world has been inspired” by Ukraine in the war and that America will continue its support. “What you’ve done in repelling the Russians in the Battle of Kyiv is extraordinary,” he said.\n\nMr Zelensky had announced on Saturday that he would meet the US officials in Kyiv on Sunday, but Joe Biden’s administration refused to confirm that and declined to discuss details of a possible visit even though planning had been under way for more than a week.\n\nJournalists who travelled to Poland with Mr Austin and Mr Blinken were barred from reporting on the trip until it ended, were not allowed to accompany them on their overland journey into Ukraine, and were prohibited from specifying where in south-east Poland they waited for the Cabinet members to return. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon cited security concerns.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nSuch financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need.\n\nThe new money, along with the sale of 165 million dollars (£128 million) in non-US made ammunition that is compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use, takes the total amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to 3.7 billion dollars (£2.9 billion) since the invasion, officials said.\n\nUS officials said they believed the new assistance would satisfy at least some of the Ukrainians’ urgent pleas for more help. New artillery, including howitzers, continues to be delivered at a rapid pace to Ukraine’s military, which is being trained on its use in neighbouring countries, the officials said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\nMs Brink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the US Senate.\n\nMr Blinken also told Ukraine’s foreign minister that the small staff from the US embassy in Kyiv, which has relocated to Poland from temporary offices in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, will begin making day trips to Lviv in the coming days.\n\nOfficials said the US had accelerated its review of security conditions in the capital and that the State Department will reopen the embassy there as soon as the situation allows.\n\nMr Biden has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of genocide for the destruction and death wrought on Ukraine. On Thursday, the US leader said he would provide a new package of 800 million dollars (£623 million) in military aid to Ukraine that included heavy artillery and drones.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nFrom Poland, Mr Blinken plans to return to Washington while Mr Austin will head to Ramstein in Germany for a meeting Tuesday of Nato defence ministers and other donor countries.\n\nThat discussion will look at battlefield updates from the ground, additional security assistance for Ukraine and longer-term defence needs in Europe, including how to step up military production to fill gaps caused by the war in Ukraine, officials said. More than 20 nations are expected to send representatives to the meeting.', 'image': 'https://jerseyeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25144250/Img33212545-4.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:53'}

World Food Programme, David Beasley, has also warned us that the war in Ukraine will lead to the worst food crisis since World War II — and World Bank President David Malpass acknowledged this.\nWe will not accept a peace that Ukraine is forced to settle for because it has missiles pointed at it.', 'channel': 'politico.eu', 'text': 'Alar Karis is the president of Estonia.\n\nThe pink elephant that a little girl played with in a day care center just a month and a half ago lay covered in dust, in the ruins of a building destroyed by Russian bombs. In Borodyanka, near Kyiv — in the midst of the destruction and devastation — I and the presidents of the other Baltic states and Poland stood and stared at the ghastly face of war. I thought of my own children and grandchildren, and I was overwhelmed by sadness and grief.\n\nAs Europe, we failed. We failed because we were unable to dissuade Russian President Vladimir Putin from starting his war. And every town and village Russia now takes in Ukraine is part of our failure. Every Ukrainian hurt, killed or deported from their home adds to our failure, as do the millions of Ukrainian war refugees in every European country.\n\nIt is important that we start helping Ukraine more effectively, more visibly and more boldly. Russia’s goal is to destroy the existing Ukrainian state; our goal is to prevent that from happening. The time has come for us to shake off our fear and start making courageous decisions.\n\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter states that a U.N. member has the inherent right to individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against it. I emphasize the word “collective” because it underscores a very important point: Ukraine has the right to defend itself, and the rest of us, for whom the charter is an essential cornerstone of international relations, have a duty to help. This is what the collective self-defense of Ukraine means.\n\nWe must do everything we can to ensure Ukraine’s strong military resistance and the sanctions isolating Russia make the cost of the war so high for Moscow that it is eventually forced to back down.\n\nEconomic sanctions must be strong and effective, without exception, and for immediate implementation. This means some inconvenience for us, but just look at the footage of Ukrainian towns and villages after the departure of the Russian army. When we look into the face of Putin’s war, we realize that the inconveniences we experience under the umbrella of the European Union and NATO are nothing compared to the suffering of Ukrainians.\n\nIt’s time to embrace debates that involve thinking outside the box. We need an oil embargo, and we need it now. By paying Russia for energy, we continue to finance its war. Let us not forget that 60 percent of Russia’s oil exports are to Europe, and that last year, the Kremlin earned €180 billion from the sale of crude oil and petroleum products.\n\nAs for gas, Estonia has made a proposal to the EU, which is being referred to as “escrow”: Part of the payment for gas will be made directly to Russia, while the other part will be transferred to a separate account, frozen for Ukraine, which will be able to use it in the future to rebuild its destroyed nation. Gas cannot be put back into the ground, so there is no reason to fear that we will receive no gas if we implement this proposal.\n\nThe head of the U.N. World Food Programme, David Beasley, has also warned us that the war in Ukraine will lead to the worst food crisis since World War II — and World Bank President David Malpass acknowledged this. As such, we must discuss whether and how, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the U.N. Charter, we could provide direct support, upon the invitation of the Ukrainian government, to keep the port of Odesa open for Ukrainian grain ships.\n\nUkrainians say they have 20 million metric tons of grain in storage silos — probably 50 million with this year’s harvest — and if it remains in storage, there will be no sowing in the coming years. It is not possible to transport this quantity to the world market by rail — there is simply too much of it.\n\nWestern countries should establish a military presence in part of the Black Sea to ensure the safe movement of commercial and humanitarian aid vessels. Surely, some will argue against this and say that no one would take such a risk. But in the end, it is a question of our willingness to meet humanitarian needs. And where there is a will, there is a way.\n\nUkraine also needs weapons to defend itself, both those that its military knows how to use and more modern, effective weaponry that requires rapid training. We can offer them this training. As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its next phase, we should work more on the planning and coordination of military aid, helping to ensure that Ukraine’s most critical needs are met. This would truly be an effective signal of our unity.\n\nThe war in Europe affects us all; no one can ignore it. To do so would be to betray Europe. And only effective sanctions and Ukraine’s continued courage will eventually bring us to a point where Russia starts discussing a ceasefire in a meaningful and serious way. Only then will peace finally be possible.\n\nBut our goal must be a peace to which Ukrainians agree. We are not pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to give in, pushing the idea that a bad peace is still better than war. We will not accept a peace that Ukraine is forced to settle for because it has missiles pointed at it.\n\n“This war will only be won by Ukraine,” wrote Eero Epner, a well-known Estonian director and journalist, who visited Kyiv alongside myself and my fellow Polish and Baltic presidents. “But if it is lost, Ukraine will not be the one that loses it: we will be the ones who lose it.”\n\nWe cannot — we must not — lose.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25/GettyImages-1240213966-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:21'}

This issue of New Eastern Europe brings you some tales and reflections of the brave Ukrainians who have united to fight the invading aggressor.\n\nThese stories provide a distinct account – some of which are written in a diary format – of the first month of the war, the incredibly horrible period when Russian troops were brutally attacking villages on the road to Kyiv and elsewhere in the country. The disturbing images of the Russian inhumanity only emerged after the Ukrainians successfully defended the areas around the capital.\n\nThis issue also analyses the impact that the war has or will have on the region and beyond. Our authors examine the sanctions against Russia, the role of Belarus in the war, Poland’s new position as a frontline country as well as the future of Russia’s relations with the West. A significant development of the wartime has been not only the unity of the European Union and NATO but also the fact that all three countries known as the Associated Trio (Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia) have officially submitted applications to become members of the EU. These developments clearly demonstrate that the war has not only brought tragic results, but historical ones as well.\n\nLastly, the issue provides a look at the extraordinary level of human response to the war, including humanitarian activities and the welcoming of refugees. At New Eastern Europe we have been extremely involved in these actions as well, and have put a lot of focus on supporting our Ukrainian contributors and translators.

Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\nRussia also fired rockets at two towns in the central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\nUkraine\'s general staff described Russian shelling and assaults along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steel works in Mariupol where the last Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a city destroyed during two months of Russian siege and bombardment.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation", denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, Britain\'s The Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.', 'image': 'https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/04/25/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg/BINARY/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:37'}

The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nOn February 24th 2022 the world awoke to the news that the Russian Federation had begun a brutal invasion and attack from land, sea and air against independent and free Ukraine. That terrible winter morning confirmed that the evidence gathered by US intelligence and shared with the world weeks before was indeed correct. Russia’s large-scale military invasion was inevitable. It was to take place, despite our utter disbelief.\n\nRussia’s plan of mass aggression directed at the Ukrainian people could also have been gathered from the televised speech that Vladimir Putin delivered on February 21st, just a few days before the invasion. In this over one-hour-long gloomy talk to the Russian nation (and indeed the whole world), Putin bluntly declared his hatred of the former republics, now independent states, and bitterness over the collapse of the Soviet Union. The communist state’s breakup is for him, as we have long known, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. Today, it is crystal clear that Putin will not spare anything that humanity holds dear in order to restore the Russian empire and halt the NATO alliance from accepting new members.\n\nCowardice and denial\n\nThe brutality of the Russian army since the start of the invasion not only shows that Putin has no respect for international norms or human lives, but also that his own state – the Russian Federation – has become a repressive fascist system. The infamous letter “Z”, first painted on Russian military vehicles, has now become an explicit symbol of this fascism. But the truth is that Russia has been on the totalitarian path for quite some time now. We have just refused to accept this, naively believing that the lessons of the Second World War had been internalised long ago and its atrocities would never be repeated. This was especially true immediately after the Cold War, when it appeared that liberal democracy would prevail worldwide as part of the “end of history”.\n\nToday, when news about Russia’s hideous crimes against the Ukrainian nation reaches us daily, we have to admit that Russia acted in this way partly because of our own cowardice and denial. To put it honestly, it was us, the international community, that absolved the Russian Federation from accountability for its many brutal invasions in the past. These actions started with Moldova and Chechnya in the 1990s, then Georgia, Syria, Crimea and Donbas in the first and second decades of the 21st century. Like now in Ukraine, all these other places witnessed the Russian army commit crimes against humanity. Yet, instead of punishing those responsible for the atrocities in our international system of justice, we stood by, silently watching as the Kremlin ordered the murders of those who had openly opposed them in Russia and abroad.\n\nAmong those who were killed is Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered for informing the world on the reality of the Second Chechen War. Natalya Estemirova, a human rights activist, was also assassinated in Chechnya for similar reasons. We all remember the murder of Boris Nemtsov, who was killed for his reports on the Russian military intervention in Donbas. The closure of Memorial – an organisation that investigated Stalin’s brutal crimes – should have been no surprise as the totalitarian regime began closing its ranks internally.\n\nAnd while we may have been shocked by all these events and even expressed our anger publicly, we did very little to prevent them from happening again. Some in the West believed that these were even isolated incidents or that business with Russia did not necessarily mean business with those killers responsible for these horrible yet largely ignored crimes. Russian disinformation and propaganda fuelled ignorance and provided a cover for those who valued business over morals, and profits over lives.\n\nInformation pervasion\n\nRussia also gained a foothold in many of our own countries, often exploiting corrupt politicians and disseminating state-sponsored fake news and disinformation that inflamed internal divides. By allowing Russia Today, later RT, and Sputnik, primarily broadcast in English (the global lingua franca, but also translated into many other languages), to frequent our media landscape, we believed that we were adhering to our cherished democratic values like freedom of speech. Under the impression that these channels were offering “a different perspective”, we allowed Putin’s sick vision of restoring the Russian empire to take root in our societies and Kremlin-created narratives meant to divide us to enter into our discourse.\n\nThus, in 2014, instead of talking about the Russian war against Ukraine, we could read about a “civil conflict” in Ukraine; “the Ukrainian crisis”; and the problem of “Ukrainian nationalists”. These phrases, however, as many finally learnt in 2021 and 2022, were only to serve as a background for a much stronger lie. It was uttered by Putin himself and used as a pretext to start the current war. He falsely stated that Ukraine has no historical right to exist and even requires “denazification”.\n\nThe “denazification” of a state whose president is Jewish is obviously a groundless argument. Yet, we have to admit that many politicians in our own countries have long been under the influence of Russia. Thanks to this, we have witnessed many destructive trends that have severely damaged not only the operations of our state institutions and political processes, but also brought on deep divisions within our highly polarised societies. Almost any issue that requires a democratic choice has become prey to Russian manipulation via its disinformation machine, online trolls, bots and useful idiots. This is true for elections, but also COVID-19, Brexit, abortion rights, race relations, LGBTQ+ rights and many other issues. Instead of adequately diagnosing the sources of these divisions, we eagerly joined in; fanning the flames that were stoked by Russia’s interference. While we cannot blame Russia for everything wrong within our own societies, we do need to acknowledge all the risks it poses to our social cohesion through echo-chambers, bubbles and cancel culture.\n\nOur money also allowed Russia to grow. We nourished the monster in the Kremlin through vast and numerous business deals that we now find so difficult to free ourselves from. For some, business with Russia is still acceptable even if their daily news reports highlight the inhumane blockade of Mariupol and the shelling of breadlines in Kharkiv. Several EU member states remain prone to pressure from Russia, having ignored repeated calls for the diversification of their energy supply.\n\nWho provoked who?\n\nUnfortunately, there are still commentators, politicians and opinion makers in the West who continue to act as useful idiots for the Kremlin by claiming that it is NATO’s fault Russia invaded Ukraine. They say that NATO provoked the conflict and Russia is only acting in its own self-defence. Is Moscow defending itself by brutally killing civilians in the thousands? By destroying entire cities and forcibly moving their populations to various regions in Russia, including the Far East? How we can even point the finger at anyone else beyond Putin and his regime is still a deep-seated mystery. Besides, NATO does not “expand”; it has an “open door policy”. In other words, if a country wishes or decides that it is in its own best interests to join the Alliance, NATO will welcome them into the family after it conforms to the highest western standards. Seeing how Russia assaults those who even consider joining NATO, we should not doubt the importance of the Alliance. What if Poland did not decide to join NATO in 1999 and waited to announce such intentions until 2015? It would not take much imagination to fathom how Putin would have reacted in such a scenario. The argument that NATO provoked Russia is another example of the Russian narrative being regurgitated in mainstream western media. The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nNot that long ago, we were disgusted by the revelations in Alexei Navalny’s film about Putin’s mansion. But no one really bothered to speak up against the gas pipeline that allowed him to reach such levels of wealth. Many in the West in fact never felt obliged enough to see their business with Russia as an act of corruption. Yet many of them were eager to point to Ukraine as being corrupt and hence unable to “meet European democratic standards”. We expected Ukrainians to listen to our guidelines on what modern statehood should look like, but their arguments (or those in Poland or the Baltic states) on why Nord Stream 2 is dangerous for the region and our security went ignored, written off as wild “Russophobia”.\n\nNow, Europe and the West face their greatest challenge since the end of the Cold War and perhaps since the outbreak of the Second World War. The refugee crisis that the Russian forces have now set in motion through their indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine will be an immense and lengthy test. The tactics of total war have already forced a large percentage of Ukraine’s future beyond its borders. It must remain a priority for the international community to provide them with care and safety. Pushing these masses of civilians into Poland, Romania and Moldova in particular is also part of the Russian strategy to put these countries under pressure, sow divisions and exhaust resources. These countries and their allies must quickly come to terms with the fact that they are now on the frontline.\n\nTowards a common victory\n\nNow, of course, we have reached a stage of western unity and solidarity with Ukraine. The response by the transatlantic community to Russia’s invasion was impressive. Putin certainly did not expect such a reaction. A new emboldened sanctions regime has been introduced and Nord Stream 2 has finally been put on hold (yet for how long, we do not know). How this war will end depends on many factors. The brave and courageous Ukrainians defending their home, led and inspired by their democratically elected president, convince us that victory is not only possible but likely. However, peace at any cost cannot be the western-imposed solution to Putin’s war. Ukraine has already sacrificed too much. It has lost too many husbands, wives, sons, daughters and grandparents. Instead, peace can only come with Ukraine’s victory; its territorial integrity intact and its future bright and prosperous.\n\nThe Russian totalitarian regime must be held to account for its crimes in this war. This includes an end to Vladimir Putin’s rule in the Kremlin. A return to business as usual, drunk on Russian disinformation and corrupted by dirty money – to a place where we were before February 24th – is no longer possible. There is only one outcome: Ukraine’s victory and the renewal of the West and its promise of a new future. The price that Ukraine is paying today cannot and will not be made in vain. Understanding this is the first step towards our common victory.\n\nThis text was written by the editors of New Eastern Europe.', 'image': 'https://neweasterneurope.eu/new_site/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/editorial.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:01'}

Poland and Bulgaria would be the first countries to have their gas cut off by Europe\'s main supplier since Russia started what it calls a military operation in Ukraine on February 24. The move to cut off supplies also followed sanctions imposed by Poland against Russian individuals and companies. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that countries he terms "unfriendly" agree to a scheme under which they would open accounts at Gazprombank and make payments for Russian gas imports in euros or US dollars that would be converted into roubles. Poland is a staunch political opponent of Russia. Polish gas company PGNiG, whose gas deal with Russia expires at the end of this year, has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract. It also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland. Poland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year, and covers about 50 per cent of national consumption. Earlier, data from the European Union network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted but they resumed later on Tuesday. Poland\'s energy supplies were secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said on Tuesday, adding there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut. Gazprom also informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it would halt gas supplies from Wednesday, the energy ministry said. Bulgaria also had a contract due to expire at the end of the year. It meets more than 90 per cent of its gas needs with Gazprom\'s imports about 3 bcm a year. Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at data intelligence firm ICIS, said: "This is a seismic warning shot by Russia." "Poland has had an anti-Russia and anti-Gazprom stance for a number of years, which is not the case for Bulgaria, so to see Bulgaria also be cut off is also quite a development in its own right," he said. Bulgaria said it had taken steps to find alternative gas supply and no restrictions on gas consumption was required for now. Germany\'s network regulator said it was monitoring the gas delivery situation from Russia after the threat to Poland supplies, adding that supply to Germany was currently guaranteed.

In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence. The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing. Mantoo added that Syria has the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled the country.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nUN doubles Ukraine aid appeal to $2.25 billion\n\nThe United Nations\' humanitarian agency (UN OCHA) said that it has been forced to double its aid appeal to $2.25 billion (€2.11 billion) as the humanitarian situation in the country worsens.\n\n"Over $2.25 billion is now required for needs inside Ukraine, more than double of the amount requested ($1.1 billion) when we launched the appeal on 1 March, a few days after the war began," the UN OCHA said in a statement.\n\nUS, allies will \'move heaven and Earth\' to meet Ukrainian security requirements — Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the aim of the conference at the air base in Ramstein, Germany was to "help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion," as well as to "build up Ukraine\'s defenses for tomorrow\'s challenges."\n\nAustin said that he discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Kyiv\'s "changing requirements" as Russia focuses on Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region. Austin said that the US and its allies will "keep moving heaven and Earth" to meet Ukraine\'s security requirements.\n\n"Ukraine needs our help to win today, and they will still need our help when the war is over," Austin said. He added that the US and its allies have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine\'s defense since the start of the war.\n\nThe defense secretary said that Ukraine "has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia\'s unprovoked invasion."\n\nAustin said that Ukraine\'s allies had provided assistance at "record speed," adding that "Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly."\n\nReferring to Russian troop withdrawal from areas around Ukraine\'s capital, Austin said that the war was "entering a new phase" following what he called "Russia\'s defeat at the battle of Kyiv."\n\n"Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man," Austin said, alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens."\n\nWatch video 01:06 Austin: \'We\'re here to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion\'\n\nExplosions hit radio facility in Russia-backed Trans-Dniester\n\nPolice in the breakaway Moldovan region of Trans-Dniester said that two explosions knocked two powerful antennas out of service in a radio facility close to Ukrainian border. The interior ministry of the region said those antennas were re-broadcasting Russian radio.\n\nThe incident occurred in a small town of Maiac about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the regional capital Tiraspol and roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said.\n\nThe explosions come just a day after several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the state security ministry in Tiraspol.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu is convening a meeting of the country\'s Supreme Security Council on Tuesday over incidents that took place in Trans-Dniester.\n\nTrans-Dniester is a narrow strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River, sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova. The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government has come under increasing pressure over not yet sending heavy weapons to Ukraine.\n\nUS kicks off Ukraine conference at Ramstein air base\n\nA defense conference on securing Ukraine\'s long-term security is now underway at the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has invited around 40 countries to the conference. While many NATO members will be present, a number of the countries invited are not NATO member states.\n\nThe attendees will include NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht.\n\nThe meeting seeks to boost weapons deliveries to Ukraine and bolster the country\'s long-term security.\n\nAustin and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday and pledged additional military assistance to Kyiv. Austin and Blinken are expected to brief allies on Ukraine\'s security needs during the conference.\n\nWatch video 02:05 US to host talks on assistance for Ukraine in Germany\n\nNo imminent threat of direct confrontation with Russia — UK armed forces minister\n\nBritish Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said he did not think there was an imminent threat of escalation in the war in Ukraine leading to nuclear conflict.\n\n"What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine. German defense company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann will be given the green light to sell "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks from previous Bundeswehr stocks, dpa reported.\n\nGermany\'s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported that Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht will pledge the anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine during today\'s meeting at the Ramstein US air base.\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Monday following a meeting with Ukrainian officials that Kyiv had requested tanks as it seeks to adapt to the shifting conditions of the conflict.\n\nGermany is reportedly to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft "Gepard" tanks\n\nKreminna in Luhansk region has fallen — UK defense ministry\n\nBritain\'s Defense Ministry said in a Tuesday intelligence update that the town of Kreminna in Ukraine\'s eastern Luhansk region has reportedly fallen to Russian forces.\n\nRussian troops are attempting to advance north to Sloviansk and east to Kramatorsk, according to the ministry.\n\n"Russian forces are likely attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the east of Ukraine," the intelligence update said, adding that Ukrainian forces have been preparing defenses in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nUK drops import tariffs on goods from Ukraine to zero\n\nThe UK has dropped tariffs on all goods coming from Ukraine, following a direct request from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"The UK will continue to do everything in its power to support Ukraine\'s fight against Putin\'s brutal and unprovoked invasion," British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said.\n\nThe average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22%.\n\nThe British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods.\n\nUkraine wants UN to seek Mariupol evacuation\n\nUkraine has urged UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol. Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes. Russia\'s Defense Ministry claimed it used missiles to destroy facilities powering the railways supplying Ukrainian forces with foreign weapons.\n\nAbout 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. Ukraine has claimed 22,000 Russian troops were killed since the invasion. Russia has acknowledged only 1,351 military deaths.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalize parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims.\n\nAfter a visit to Kyiv, Blinken said Russia\'s military was underperforming, and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nWatch video 02:54 Russian missiles strike Ukrainian rail stations\n\nYou can revisit our live updates from April 25 here.\n\nsi, lo, aw/wmr, rs, mhm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61602081_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:19'}

Russia is also proving that energy resources are a weapon. That is why the EU needs to be united and impose an embargo on energy resources, depriving the Russians of their energy weapons.”\n\nThe move will be a grave concern to those countries who are the most heavily dependent on Russian gas, such as Germany, but at a hastily arranged press conference, Polish ministers said they had sufficient supplies to weather an interruption while accusing Gazprom of a breach of contract.\n\nAnna Moskwa, Poland’s minister for climate, said: “There are no worries about shortages of gas in our homes. It is worth pointing out that liquified natural gas alone supplies the market sufficiently. LNG deliveries in [terminal] Świnoujście are growing – in 2015 there was one, in 2021 it was already 35. As of today, it provides for about 50 deliveries.”\n\nShe added: “Appropriate diversification strategies that we have introduced allow us to feel on the safe side in this situation.”\n\nPGNiG, Poland’s largest gas supplier, said it would file a breach of contract lawsuit over Gazprom’s decision.\n\nRussia currently supplies about 55% of Poland’s annual demand of about 21bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas but the country’s government has still been pushing the EU and other western allies to go further in punishing the Kremlin.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Bulgaria’s energy ministry said it had been told that supplies of Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline would also cease on Wednesday.\n\nOnce a close ally of Moscow, Bulgaria has cut many of its ties with Russia, supporting sanctions against Russia and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\nPrime Minister Kiril Petkov and members of his coalition government were due to travel to Kyiv on Wednesday for aid talks with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Balkan country meets more than 90% of its gas needs with Russian imports, but the government insisted that no restrictions would be imposed on domestic gas consumption would be imposed for.\n\nThe NGO Europe Beyond Coal has calculated that the EU has sent more than €41bn (£34.7bn) to Russia in payments for fossil fuels since it invaded Ukraine two months ago.\n\nPoland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, had already said he intended to ban Russian gas and oil imports by the end of the year and there has been a move to diversify to cover for losses.\n\nThe key Yamal pipeline carries natural gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, through Belarus. But the Polish government had made a clear move away from dependency by constructing a liquefied natural gas terminal in the Baltic port of Świnoujście, run by Qatari and US companies, which is capable of handling 5 bcm of gas. It is being expanded to 7.5 bcm by 2023.\n\nThe extent to which Polish industry will be able to rely on this flow is yet to be seen, however, and other countries will be worried about the development.\n\nMoscow had warned clients in March that they risked having their gas supplies cut unless they paid in roubles.\n\nThe European Commission had nevertheless said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars.\n\nThe only EU leader who has suggested he would pay Gazprom in roubles is Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, whose rightwing government has pursued a close relationship with Putin’s regime for over a decade.\n\nThe move by the Kremlin comes as EU member states are drawing up a sixth wave of sanctions that could include imposing a ceiling on the price paid for Russian oil.\n\nBut there remains a reluctance in Berlin, in particular, to go hard on gas imports given the German economy’s dependence on Russia in that field.\n\nIn early April, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told the Bundestag that the country’s energy reliance had “grown over decades and cannot be ended from one day to the next”, given that it would lead to the rationing of energy to industry and the potential closure of its largest factories.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gazprom denied that gas flows to Poland had been stopped. Spokesperson Sergei Kupriyanov said: “Today Poland has to pay for gas supplies according to the new payment procedure.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/420e247b8a553addda3a467a546bd7b9ad9b5477/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ae70b85c18886bd10a227f8648798a1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:05'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene," the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media.\n\n3:37pm: Ukraine war has consequences for Asia, EU chief warns neutral India\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine threatens India\'s regional security, the European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Monday during a trip to New Delhi aimed at fostering deeper strategic ties.\n\nVon der Leyen is the latest visiting Western diplomat to press India, which gets most of its arms from Russia, over its neutral stance on the conflict.\n\nBoth the EU and India face challenges from a rising China, and von der Leyen raised the spectre of Beijing\'s partnership with Moscow to warn the war had consequences further afield than Europe.\n\n"The outcome of the war will not only determine the future of Europe but also deeply affect the Indo-Pacific region," she told an audience at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitical conference in New Delhi.\n\n"Russia and China have forged a seemingly unrestrained pact. They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war. Since the beginning of April, just under 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, after some 3.4 million left in March.\n\nThe UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an additional 218,000 citizens of third countries—largely students and migrant workers—have also fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began.\n\nWomen and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.\n\nBeyond the refugees, the IOM estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Ukrainian children have had to flee their homes, including those who remain in the country.\n\n2:45pm: Visit by top US officials sign of improved security situation in Kyiv\n\nA visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday is a strong sign that the security situation in Ukraine\'s capital has improved.

Unsurprisingly, many of these efforts have often been penetrated due to the poor and blatant construction exposed by the mainstream Western mass media that perhaps interact closely with the intelligence circles.\n\nBut this hardly means that Western governments and the mass media are bona fide disseminators of war information that is free from distortion and manipulation. This is because, in the modern and contemporary history of war, government propaganda is a commonplace. It is instrumental to mobilize, sustain and strengthen domestic and international support for war efforts, particularly when magnified by mass media. An underdog country can use such propaganda to enhance international support, especially through provision of weapons, ammunition, logistics and, if feasible, reinforcements, to complement its inferior war capability, as well as economic sanction against the top dog country. On the other hand, the latter can employ such a propaganda to enhance popular morale and supplement resource mobilization capacity.\n\nIn fact, Western government war propaganda and the mainstream mass media reports have established a predominant international opinion that sides sympathetically with Ukraine as the innocent underdog[i]. This is particularly because numerous video footage has lively covered massive exoduses of Ukrainian women and children to neighboring countries, missile bombardment and other forms of shelling against urban residential areas, and vivid images of killed and injured noncombatants as well as combatants, among others. Unfortunately, timely open-source information on evolving operational and tactical realities is limited, partial, unbalanced and/or, biased, possibly with intentional distortions and manipulations. Yet, the reports seem to prove atrocities committed by the Russian invasion forces, demonizing these forces and President Vladimir Putin at the levels of jus ad bellum and jus in bello.\n\nYet, war propaganda becomes unplausible and ineffective, especially when detached from evolving battlefield realities. Until then, war propaganda surely hampers coolheaded analysis and appropriate policy prescription on how to end a war, while unnecessarily protracting warfare involving a significantly higher death toll and further destruction.\n\nIn this light, this study will cast some different light on the tenability of the predominant factual recognition and discourse in mainstream Western mass media. The first jus in bello cases are about Western allegation of atrocities committed by the Russian side against Ukrainian non-combatants, particularly under the condition of extremely fierce urban warfare in the cities of Mariupol and Bucha. The second jus ad bellum case is about Russian allegation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine. These cases are particularly important because most of Western news and reports have flatly turned down Russian counterparts as misinformation and disinformation, without any serious examination. Certainly, the current author of this piece does not enjoy any privileged access to classified information but only to open sources. Yet, careful examination of open-source materials, including Russian and alternative media sources, may make it possible to identify blind assumptions and invalid judgements in the current dominant Western discourse, if not to present correct facts and cogent judgements.\n\n1. The Mariupol Case\n\n1) The Context\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky stated in his on-line speech of March 23 to the Japanese Diet that several thousand Ukrainian civilians, including 121 children, had been killed, together with nine millions refugees and internally displaced civilians[ii]. This unexpectedly low level of death toll may indicate that Russian invasion forces exercised certain self-restraint in attacking civilians, except collateral damage.\n\nIn fact, Douglas Macgregor[iii], a retired U.S. Army Colonel and a Senior Advisor to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, stated that, despite the strong impression generated by the repeated exposure to video footage, President Putin strictly ordered from the outset of the war to avoid killing civilians and destroying urban areas as much as possible[iv]. This is consistent with his historical outlook on the triune Russian national identity – White, Little and Great Russians (respectively, Belarussians, Ukrainians and Russians), characterized by strong historical unity and brotherhood[v]. Naturally ,it begs the question of why the Russian forces killed many Ukrainian civilians and severely destroyed urban residential areas in Ukraine, involving an inscrutable disjunction between Putin’s own creed and practice.\n\nExtremely fierce urban warfare, especially in the City of Mariupol, is a natural consequence of the stark disparity of Russian and Ukrainian military power, to which both sides have even introduced foreign volunteer fighters and mercenaries[vi]. With its overwhelming superiority, the Russian invasion forces neutralized a significant portion of main high-end platforms, assets and on-ground facilities of the Ukrainian armed forces at the initial stage of the current war, including air superiority fighters, major battle tanks and the command & control systems[vii]. This is consistent with numerous video footage available in public domain that primarily captures Ukrainian infantry operations with portable anti-tank missiles for close combat and low-altitude anti-air missiles, while few high-end platforms are visible. In fact, the Russian Defense Ministry said that, soon after the start of the war, the Russian forces totally destroyed Ukrainian Air Force combat aircraft while some of them escaped to Poland and Romania[viii]. Reportedly, the Russia forces destroyed 974 Ukrainian tanks and other armored vehicles just for the first three weeks[ix]. No wonder, MacGregor judged that the Ukrainian units still active “(were) completely surrounded, cut off and isolated in various town and cities”, with supplies likely running out soon[x]. Ukrainian infantry and special operation forces in Mariupol were cornered at bay without reinforcement nor air cover. An Azov Battalion commander there vainly urged the U.S.-led NATO to make armed intervention against Russia, especially to set an effective no-fly zone over Ukraine, while attributing a grave humanitarian crisis in the making to Russia。[xi]\n\n2) Who attacked the maternity hospital and the drama theater?\n\nThe Ukrainian government strongly condemned Russia for its military attack against a maternity hospital in Mariupol on March 17[xii], which injured 17 people including women, children and doctors, with at least five of them dead thereafter[xiii]. But Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov justified the attack because an Azov Battalion unit turned the hospital to a combat base[xiv], claiming the victims as unavoidable and lawful collateral damage. Surprisingly, the pregnant woman on spotlight in the reports later disclosed that Ukrainian soldiers used the hospital as base while holding these civilians as human shield against Russian forces, suggesting that the incident was an act of self-destruct and a false flag operation by the Ukraine’s side[xv]. This is compatible with other fragmentary video footage that capture how Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol have been used as human shield[xvi] and prevented from leaving the city[xvii].\n\nAlso, the Ukrainian government alleged, echoed aloud by major Western mass media, that, on March 16, a Russian airstrike dropped a powerful bomb on the Mariupol Drama Theater sheltering some 1,300 local residents, including women and children, and despite large signs of “children” that were clearly visible from aircraft. Reportedly, the death toll reached at least to 300[xviii]. The Russian government flatly denied the allegation and instead accused the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, of blowing up the theater building. This is compatible with the interview of a 17- year-old female survivor of the incident with the Abkhazian Network News Agency, who eye-witnessed Azov soldiers hiding themselves behind civilian hostages in the building[xix].\n\nMore specifically, a Russian military spokesman stated that Azov Battalion units held civilian hostages in the theater building as human shield, using the upper floor as firing points. This means that the Russian attack aimed at these units, involving significant civilian casualties as collateral damage during the engagement[xx]. This is a plausible account on what happened, particularly given the very similar circumstances of the above hospital case.\n\nIt is now crucially important to inquire what the Azov Battalion is all about and if the troop has the established notoriety of committing such atrocities.\n\n3）The Azov Battalion[xxi]\n\nThe Azov Battalion is now a part of the Ukrainian National Guard, which is the country’s gendarmerie under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Its name originates from the fact that it has been based in Mariupol in the Azov Sea costal region since 2014, first as a volunteer militia that fought against Russian separatist forces in the Donbas War and later in the same year incorporated into the National Guard while expanded in scale into a regiment. As Russia labels it as neo-Nazis, it in fact uses controversial symbols resembling the Nazis SS Wolfsangel, though it denies any connection with Nazism[xxii]. Yet, in 2015, an Azov spokesman disclosed 10-20% of units consisted of neo-Nazis members[xxiii]. The concern over the Azov is serious enough to the extent that the U.S. Congress enacted a legislative measure, Consolidated Appropriation Bill of 2018, to ban military aids to the paramilitary due to its white supremacist ideology and neo-Nazism[xxiv].\n\nThe Azov has faced serious allegations of committing torture and war crimes, including the grossly underinvestigated case of the 2014 Odessa Clashes in which some 50 pro-Russia separatists were killed[xxv]. In fact, the U.N. Human Rights Office of High Commissioner published reports that connect the Azov Battalion to war crimes such as mass looting, unlawful detention, and torture[xxvi]. Clearly. Russia’s counter-allegations on the above atrocities in Mariupol are at least compatible with an established understanding on Azov’s behavioral pattern connected to war crimes.\n\nActually, Russia’s emphasis and Western de-emphasis on the Azov Battalion is obscurely central to their intensified exchanges of war propaganda and counter-propaganda, on the ground that the paramilitary has constituted a major U.S instrument of covert military intervention in Russia-Ukraine armed conflict. More specifically, the CIA had a secret advisory and training program for Ukrainian paramilitaries and militias, most probably including the Azov, for eight years until shortly before the start of the current war, despite the aforementioned legislative ban. The CIA has had training centers in the U.S. and eastern Ukraine for sniper techniques[xxvii], anti-tank missile handling, covert communications, and other tactics necessary for insurgency and counter-insurgency[xxviii]. Thus, the issue of the Azov Battalion cannot simply be reduced to the question of war crimes, but can only be fully comprehended in the context of a U.S.-Russia proxy war over the Donbas region that is central to NATO expansion to Ukraine and determination of their spheres of interest.\n\n2. The Bucha Case\n\nA similar suspicion of war propaganda is not easily excludable, with a focus on the atrocities allegedly committed by the Russian armed forces against local Ukrainian civilians in the city of Bucha. Major Western governments and the mainstream mass media are condemning, with strongest terms, the unspeakable atrocities against local Ukrainian civilians on the way of retreat after hard battles to vainly capture Kiev. However, on March 31 when the Russian forces left the city, its mayor did not at all mention of the atrocities in an interview with a Ukrainian on-line news site[xxix] which is compatible with his bright expression in a selfie video taken on the same day[xxx]. On April 2, when Ukrainian army forces entered the city to make sure of a complete retreat of the Russian forces, the video footage by a local news media captured no corpse on roads and no sign of emotional distress among the local population. On April 1, Azov Battalion troops entered the city[xxxi], and on April 3, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense released video footage as evidence of the atrocities committed by the Russian forces, which neither the New York Times nor the Pentagon are independently able to verify the assertion of the Ministry[xxxii]. In addition, in the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. and the U.K. blocked Russia’s proposal to send an independent fact-finding mission to Ukraine[xxxiii].\n\nThus, there is a good possibility that the Azov Battalion might have fabricated or purposefully committed at least some parts of the “atrocities” by itself[xxxiv]. (More specifically, to differentiate which camp they belong, pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian civilians wear blue or white armbands respectively. Many corpses in Bucha wore white armbands as in video footage available. The Azov and/or other ultra-right militia units may have committed the atrocities out of emotional impulse, while the mass media and propaganda section of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs may have made up the scene to impute responsibilities of war crime to the Russian invasion forces[xxxv]. It should be reminded that the current war has the dimension of ethnic conflict as well as that of inter-state war.)\n\nGiven the leading role of BBC reports on this matter with the analysis of a satellite image, this begs the question of if the U.K. intelligence circles are engaged in elaborate war propaganda against Russia to mislead and manipulate other major Western governments and mass media[xxxvi].\n\n3. The Case of Biological Weapon R&D\n\nPossession of weapon of mass destruction by a revisionist power may constitute a casus belli of a status quo power, particularly when the latter sees the former’s move as its existential threat or serious threat against its vital national interests. Yet, legitimatizing a war has to satisfy some procedural requirements according to international law with presentation of solid evidence to the international society.\n\nIn this light, Russia’s allegation on Ukraine’s nuclear weapon programs is not tenable at all, at least at this point, due to its abrupt aggression against Ukraine without presenting any substantial evidence[xxxvii]. Also, there are little significant related information in public domain, though Ukraine has active nuclear power plants with some substantial potential to develop nuclear weapons as the country was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nBut Russia’s accusation of U.S.-assisted biological weapon R&D in Ukraine, as articulated with a trove of original documentation by Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, Commander of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troop of the Russian Army[xxxviii], is not totally deniable but seems plausible with open-source information[xxxix]. Most remarkably, Victoria Nuland, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, admitted the existence of biolaboratories in Ukraine under the bilateral cooperative programs of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency during a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations[xl], while the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department unequivocally denied U.S.-funded biological weapon laboratories in Ukraine[xli]. In addition, an official letter from an official in charge at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to a project manager of Black & Veatch, a DTRA contractor, attests to their significant collaborative research relationship, while another official letter from an official in charge at the DTRA office in Kiev to an official in charge at the Ukraine Ministry Defense indicates their clear awareness of the potential usefulness of their research collaboration for biological weapon development[xlii].\n\nCertainly, the Agency’s Biological Threat Reduction Programs may serve bona fide statutory purposes, not designed to contribute to virus and other biological weapon R&D. Yet, suspicion remains, given that the offense and defense of biological warfare is generally the head and tail of similar biological weapon technologies while there is no clear demarcation line between military and civil research in most advanced virus and other biological R&D that involves genetic manipulation. The lack of confidence in the sectoral culture has recently become worse because Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the President Biden, hid the fact before a Senate hearing that the EcoHealth Alliance, New York City-based nonprofit organization, funneled U.S. public funds to gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses at China’s Wuhan lab, making it feasible to bypass stringent domestic regulations and strict public eyes. The experiment is suspected potentially useful for biological weapon R&D, and a virus leak from the lab might have been a primary cause of the current COVIT-19 pandemic[xliii].\n\n4. Reflection\n\nHitherto, this investigative inquiry has cast significant doubt and suspicion on the established Western discourse that sided uncritically with Ukraine in its war against hyper-demonized Russia, almost exclusively on the basis of Western government war information and mass media reports, and without carefully checking Russian reports.\n\nOf course, Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine is utterly indisputable, and a great number of innocent Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the current war, either in atrocity or collateral damage. But who killed how many civilians and in what ways is not self-evident as reported in the Western media, especially in the context of ethnic conflict and urban warfare as the world learnt from gross information manipulation in the former Yugoslavia ethnic conflict[xliv]. It is increasingly necessary to check Western reports carefully against Russian ones, while verifying the authenticity of allegedly “original” U.S. documents presented by the Russian government and mass media. The U.S. government will be accountable, if verified.\n\nInundated with propaganda and counter-propaganda both by the West and Russia day after day, both political leaders and the public in the West will suffer self-poisoning effect of the hyper-demonized image of Russia on making coolheaded policy analysis. It is high time that the Western governments and mainstream mass media recalibrate war propaganda and counter-propaganda, in view of the need to think of how to end the current war and to keep diplomatic channels open with Russia that would most unlikely capitulate, given that it is a nuclear power coequal to the United States.\n\n[i] Despite the current image of an innocent victim, Ukraine has continually played a disturbing role to Asian and international security, particularly because it sold an ex-Soviet aircraft career, Varyag, as scrap to China, that has been already repaired and commissioned as the country’s first aircraft career, Liaoning; and because Ukraine has not effectively banned outflows of ballistic missile technologies to North Korea that has significantly contributed to the development of its nuclear weapon programs.

EU countries have largely refused that demand, saying it breaks contracts denominated in dollars and euros.\n\nThe European Commission said that such payments would violate EU sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nPGNiG said it continued "to settle its liabilities for natural gas delivered under the Yamal Contract in accordance with its current terms."\n\nThe Polish utility demanded that Gazprom resume gas deliveries. If that doesn\'t happen, it warned: "the Company reserves the right to claim damages."\n\n"There is no contractual basis for the suspension of the supply of the gas delivered under the Yamal Contract," PGNiG said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Gazprom spokesperson Sergey Kupriyanov told reporters in Moscow: "Poland is obliged to pay for gas supplies in accordance with the new payment procedure," according to the official TASS news agency.\n\nBulgaria also balked at the demand to pay in rubles. The new Russian payment system is "at odds with the agreement that is effective until the end of this year and poses considerable risks for the Bulgarian side," said the energy ministry.\n\nPoland has vowed to end imports of Russian coal, gas and oil, and is pressing other EU countries to rapidly do the same.\n\n"We are prepared for the complete cut off of Russian fossil fuels," Polish Energy Minister Anna Moskwa said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nPoland gets 46 percent of its gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia, according to Forum Energii, a think tank.\n\nPolish authorities insisted that the cutoff won\'t affect gas users.\n\n"Thanks to the implementation of the government\'s strategy of diversifying gas supply sources, PGNiG is prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on the western and southern borders and the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście," said PGNiG.\n\nMoskwa said: "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security," adding that the country\'s gas storage was 80 percent full. She said Poland will continue to buy gas on European and international markets and aims to fill its reserves to 100 percent.\n\nBulgaria, which gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia, said it has "taken steps to ensure alternative supplies of natural gas and handle the situation. Measures to restrict consumption in Bulgaria are unnecessary at this stage."\n\nPoland\'s 1996 agreement with Gazprom expires at the end of the year, and Warsaw has said it won\'t be renewed.

But Johnson insisted that the West did not need to make concessions despite the nuclear threat.\n\n“People say we have to make a concession, we have to worry about what Putin might do because of the risk of his defeat,” Johnson said. “I think he has got a lot of space, he has got a lot of room for manoeuvre.”\n\n10:02pm: Gazprom has informed Bulgaria, Poland of halt to gas supplies from Wednesday\n\nRussia’s Gazprom has informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it will halt gas supplies as of Wednesday, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ministry said that along with state gas companies it has taken steps to find alternative arrangements for the supply of natural gas and to deal with the situation.\n\nIt said for the time being no restrictions in the gas consumption in the Balkan country which meets over 90 percent of its gas needs with Gazprom’s imports, were required.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Polish officials had said Russia is suspending natural gas deliveries to Poland beginning Wednesday morning after that country refused a demand to pay for its supplies in Russian rubles\n\nPoland’s state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Russian gas giant Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop on Wednesday.\n\nPolish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources. She said the country has been effectively independent when it comes to Russian gas for some time.\n\n“There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes,” Moskwa tweeted.\n\n9:39pm IAEA says it has agreed with Ukraine to help repair damage to Chernobyl\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday said he had agreed with Ukraine to help repair the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant after it was occupied by Russian troops.\n\n“It is visible that there is damage and we are assessing that,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told a news conference in Kyiv after visiting the station.\n\nThirty-six years ago, on April 26, 1986, an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction destroyed the reactor in an accident that was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities.\n\nRussian troops took over the site on February 24 of this year, the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, taking Ukrainian soldiers prisoner and detaining civilian staff.\n\nThe occupation lasted until the end of March and raised global fears of nuclear leaks.\n\nRussia’s temporary takeover of the Chernobyl site was “very, very dangerous” and raised radiation levels but they have now returned to “normal”, Grossi said during his visit there earlier on Tuesday.\n\n9:17pm: US warns not to \'escalate tensions\' after Moldova region blasts\n\nThe United States on Tuesday warned against attempts to "escalate tensions" after a series of blasts in a Russian-backed separatist region of Moldova, which borders Ukraine.\n\nWhile stopping short of backing Kyiv\'s contention that Russia was responsible for the incidents in Transnistria, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters: "We do remain concerned about any potential attempts to escalate tensions."\n\n"We reiterate the Moldovan government\'s call for calm in response to these incidents and we fully support Moldova\'s territorial integrity and sovereignty," Price said.\n\nThe mysterious recent blasts which targeted the state security ministry, a radio tower and military unit came days after a senior Russian commander claimed Russian speakers in Moldova were being oppressed.\n\nRussian forces have been positioned in Transnistria for three decades after the predominantly Russian-speaking region seceded from the former Soviet republic, a decision not recognized internationally.\n\n9:04pm: US says talk of Lavrov\'s comments on nuclear escalation is irresponsible\n\nThe US State Department on Tuesday criticized Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s comments about the potential of a nuclear war, saying loose talk about nuclear escalation was the "height of irresponsibility."\n\nLavrov warned the West on Monday not to underestimate the elevated risks of nuclear conflict over Ukraine and said he viewed NATO as being "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia by supplying Kyiv with weaponry.\n\n8:10pm: Putin agrees to United Nations, Red Cross help to evacuate civilians from Azovstal plant, UN says\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin agreed “in principle” to UN and International Committee for the Red Cross involvement in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in Ukraine’s Mariupol, the United Nations said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n“Follow-on discussions will be had with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Russian Defence Ministry,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement after Putin met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Moscow.\n\n7:44pm: Putin tells UN chief he still has \'hope\' for Ukraine talks\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told the visiting UN chief Tuesday that he still had hope for negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject (talks)," Putin told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was visiting Moscow, in televised remarks.\n\nSitting across from Guterres at a long table at the Kremlin, Putin said efforts at talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, speaks to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting in the Kremlin, in Moscow, Russia, on April 26, 2022. © Vladimir Astapkovich, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nPutin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia\'s military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.\n\nGuterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (see 2:02pm, below) for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\n6:45pm: Blinken says Putin not \'serious\' about Ukraine diplomacy\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the Ukraine war, despite a series of international efforts.\n\n“We’ve seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: “Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table.”\n\nBlinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlinken hailed what he saw on the trip and said that the US was speeding up arms deliveries, with the process now often taking only 72 hours after Ukraine sends requests.\n\n6:10pm: Germany confirms plans to send Ukraine tanks, in policy shift\n\nGermany said Tuesday it would send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a clear switch in Berlin’s cautious policy on military backing for Kyiv that was welcomed by the United States.\n\nThe government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the US Ramstein airbase.\n\nThe move comes after heavy criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to Ukraine, despite announcing a “turning point” in German defence policy in response to Russia’s invasion.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the pledge to send “some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems”, the English name for the weapons, was “especially welcome”.\n\n5:19pm: US Defence Secretary says US, allies to meet monthly on arming Ukraine\n\nThe United States and its allies will meet once a month to discuss Ukraine\'s defence needs to battle invading Russian troops, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.\n\n"Today\'s gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine\'s self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\n4:53pm: FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg on the fallout over blasts in Transnistria, Moldova\n\n02:48 © FRANCE 24\n\n4:08pm: Putin, Erdogan discuss humanitarian corridors in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow’s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin statement, the leaders in a phone call talked about “efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors”.\n\nThis came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.\n\nThe Kremlin said Erdogan asked Putin about the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe Russian leader told him that “the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there”.\n\n3:09pm: Nearly 5.3 million flee Ukraine war as refugees, up more than 32,000 since Monday\n\nNearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.\n\nIn total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 32,753 over Monday\'s figure.\n\nWhile the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday (see 11:31am, below) that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.\n\n2:02 pm: Guterres says Russia, UN have \'very different\' views of events in Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had "very frank" discussions with Lavrov. He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Le Drian “reiterated France\'s request for the free movement of civilians and free access for humanitarian aid in Mariupol, as in the rest of Ukraine”, the statement noted.\n\nFrance is delivering Caesar cannons with a range of 40 kilometres (25 miles) to Ukraine and is among 40 countries attending the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group meeting hosted by the US at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nJ’ai souhaité confirmer à mon homologue ukrainien @DmytroKuleba que la France maintiendrait son appui déterminé à l’Ukraine face à la guerre à laquelle elle est confrontée : assistance financière, sanctions, équipements de défense, lutte contre l’impunité. pic.twitter.com/9OgtKltUar — Jean-Yves Le Drian (@JY_LeDrian) April 26, 2022\n\n10:32 am: ‘Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine’: US defence chief Austin\n\nOpening the gathering of representatives of more than 40 countries at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called on members of the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group to arrive at “a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to move heaven and earth so that we can meet them”.\n\nAustin, who is chairing the meeting at the US air base, said Kyiv had done “an impressive job defending its sovereignty against Russia’s unprovoked invasion”, adding: "“Ukraine’s valor and skill will go down in military history.”\n\n“Ukraine has now beaten back the Russian military for 62 days. Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\n06:12am: Russia’s Lavrov warns of ‘real threat’ of World War III\n\nRussia has warned of the “real” threat of World War III breaking out, ahead of a Tuesday meeting between the United States and allies over sending further arms to war-torn Ukraine.\n\nMoscow’s invasion of its neighbour has triggered an outburst of support from Western nations that has seen weapons pour into the country to help it wage war against Russian troops.\n\nBut Western powers have been reluctant to deepen their involvement, for fear of sparking a conflict against nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nSpeaking to Russian news agencies, Moscow’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the risk of a World War III “is serious” and criticised Kyiv’s approach to floundering peace talks.\n\n“It is real, you can’t underestimate it,” Lavrov said.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Vedika Bahl brings us a recap of Monday’s events:\n\n01:49 Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, April 7, 2022. © Reuters\n\n04:36am: Pressure mounts on Germany’s Schroeder over Russia ties\n\nPressure was growing Monday inside Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) to expel their former leader and ex-chancellor Gerhard Schroeder over his apparent refusal to renounce his business ties with Russia.\n\nSchroeder, who is a lobbyist for Russian gas and has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, sparked fresh outrage following remarks in an interview with the New York Times published this weekend.\n\nUnrepentant over his business links with Russia, he told the newspaper: “I don’t do mea culpa. It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and REUTERS)\n\n© Studio graphique France Médias Monde\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/e48d305a-c59a-11ec-898c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/20220426-gazprom-m.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:50'}

World Food Programme, David Beasley, has also warned us that the war in Ukraine will lead to the worst food crisis since World War II — and World Bank President David Malpass acknowledged this.\nWe will not accept a peace that Ukraine is forced to settle for because it has missiles pointed at it.', 'channel': 'politico.eu', 'text': 'Alar Karis is the president of Estonia.\n\nThe pink elephant that a little girl played with in a day care center just a month and a half ago lay covered in dust, in the ruins of a building destroyed by Russian bombs. In Borodyanka, near Kyiv — in the midst of the destruction and devastation — I and the presidents of the other Baltic states and Poland stood and stared at the ghastly face of war. I thought of my own children and grandchildren, and I was overwhelmed by sadness and grief.\n\nAs Europe, we failed. We failed because we were unable to dissuade Russian President Vladimir Putin from starting his war. And every town and village Russia now takes in Ukraine is part of our failure. Every Ukrainian hurt, killed or deported from their home adds to our failure, as do the millions of Ukrainian war refugees in every European country.\n\nIt is important that we start helping Ukraine more effectively, more visibly and more boldly. Russia’s goal is to destroy the existing Ukrainian state; our goal is to prevent that from happening. The time has come for us to shake off our fear and start making courageous decisions.\n\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter states that a U.N. member has the inherent right to individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against it. I emphasize the word “collective” because it underscores a very important point: Ukraine has the right to defend itself, and the rest of us, for whom the charter is an essential cornerstone of international relations, have a duty to help. This is what the collective self-defense of Ukraine means.\n\nWe must do everything we can to ensure Ukraine’s strong military resistance and the sanctions isolating Russia make the cost of the war so high for Moscow that it is eventually forced to back down.\n\nEconomic sanctions must be strong and effective, without exception, and for immediate implementation. This means some inconvenience for us, but just look at the footage of Ukrainian towns and villages after the departure of the Russian army. When we look into the face of Putin’s war, we realize that the inconveniences we experience under the umbrella of the European Union and NATO are nothing compared to the suffering of Ukrainians.\n\nIt’s time to embrace debates that involve thinking outside the box. We need an oil embargo, and we need it now. By paying Russia for energy, we continue to finance its war. Let us not forget that 60 percent of Russia’s oil exports are to Europe, and that last year, the Kremlin earned €180 billion from the sale of crude oil and petroleum products.\n\nAs for gas, Estonia has made a proposal to the EU, which is being referred to as “escrow”: Part of the payment for gas will be made directly to Russia, while the other part will be transferred to a separate account, frozen for Ukraine, which will be able to use it in the future to rebuild its destroyed nation. Gas cannot be put back into the ground, so there is no reason to fear that we will receive no gas if we implement this proposal.\n\nThe head of the U.N. World Food Programme, David Beasley, has also warned us that the war in Ukraine will lead to the worst food crisis since World War II — and World Bank President David Malpass acknowledged this. As such, we must discuss whether and how, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the U.N. Charter, we could provide direct support, upon the invitation of the Ukrainian government, to keep the port of Odesa open for Ukrainian grain ships.\n\nUkrainians say they have 20 million metric tons of grain in storage silos — probably 50 million with this year’s harvest — and if it remains in storage, there will be no sowing in the coming years. It is not possible to transport this quantity to the world market by rail — there is simply too much of it.\n\nWestern countries should establish a military presence in part of the Black Sea to ensure the safe movement of commercial and humanitarian aid vessels. Surely, some will argue against this and say that no one would take such a risk. But in the end, it is a question of our willingness to meet humanitarian needs. And where there is a will, there is a way.\n\nUkraine also needs weapons to defend itself, both those that its military knows how to use and more modern, effective weaponry that requires rapid training. We can offer them this training. As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its next phase, we should work more on the planning and coordination of military aid, helping to ensure that Ukraine’s most critical needs are met. This would truly be an effective signal of our unity.\n\nThe war in Europe affects us all; no one can ignore it. To do so would be to betray Europe. And only effective sanctions and Ukraine’s continued courage will eventually bring us to a point where Russia starts discussing a ceasefire in a meaningful and serious way. Only then will peace finally be possible.\n\nBut our goal must be a peace to which Ukrainians agree. We are not pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to give in, pushing the idea that a bad peace is still better than war. We will not accept a peace that Ukraine is forced to settle for because it has missiles pointed at it.\n\n“This war will only be won by Ukraine,” wrote Eero Epner, a well-known Estonian director and journalist, who visited Kyiv alongside myself and my fellow Polish and Baltic presidents. “But if it is lost, Ukraine will not be the one that loses it: we will be the ones who lose it.”\n\nWe cannot — we must not — lose.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25/GettyImages-1240213966-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:21'}

This issue of New Eastern Europe brings you some tales and reflections of the brave Ukrainians who have united to fight the invading aggressor.\n\nThese stories provide a distinct account – some of which are written in a diary format – of the first month of the war, the incredibly horrible period when Russian troops were brutally attacking villages on the road to Kyiv and elsewhere in the country. The disturbing images of the Russian inhumanity only emerged after the Ukrainians successfully defended the areas around the capital.\n\nThis issue also analyses the impact that the war has or will have on the region and beyond. Our authors examine the sanctions against Russia, the role of Belarus in the war, Poland’s new position as a frontline country as well as the future of Russia’s relations with the West. A significant development of the wartime has been not only the unity of the European Union and NATO but also the fact that all three countries known as the Associated Trio (Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia) have officially submitted applications to become members of the EU. These developments clearly demonstrate that the war has not only brought tragic results, but historical ones as well.\n\nLastly, the issue provides a look at the extraordinary level of human response to the war, including humanitarian activities and the welcoming of refugees.

The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nOn February 24th 2022 the world awoke to the news that the Russian Federation had begun a brutal invasion and attack from land, sea and air against independent and free Ukraine. That terrible winter morning confirmed that the evidence gathered by US intelligence and shared with the world weeks before was indeed correct. Russia’s large-scale military invasion was inevitable. It was to take place, despite our utter disbelief.\n\nRussia’s plan of mass aggression directed at the Ukrainian people could also have been gathered from the televised speech that Vladimir Putin delivered on February 21st, just a few days before the invasion. In this over one-hour-long gloomy talk to the Russian nation (and indeed the whole world), Putin bluntly declared his hatred of the former republics, now independent states, and bitterness over the collapse of the Soviet Union. The communist state’s breakup is for him, as we have long known, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. Today, it is crystal clear that Putin will not spare anything that humanity holds dear in order to restore the Russian empire and halt the NATO alliance from accepting new members.\n\nCowardice and denial\n\nThe brutality of the Russian army since the start of the invasion not only shows that Putin has no respect for international norms or human lives, but also that his own state – the Russian Federation – has become a repressive fascist system. The infamous letter “Z”, first painted on Russian military vehicles, has now become an explicit symbol of this fascism. But the truth is that Russia has been on the totalitarian path for quite some time now. We have just refused to accept this, naively believing that the lessons of the Second World War had been internalised long ago and its atrocities would never be repeated. This was especially true immediately after the Cold War, when it appeared that liberal democracy would prevail worldwide as part of the “end of history”.\n\nToday, when news about Russia’s hideous crimes against the Ukrainian nation reaches us daily, we have to admit that Russia acted in this way partly because of our own cowardice and denial. To put it honestly, it was us, the international community, that absolved the Russian Federation from accountability for its many brutal invasions in the past. These actions started with Moldova and Chechnya in the 1990s, then Georgia, Syria, Crimea and Donbas in the first and second decades of the 21st century. Like now in Ukraine, all these other places witnessed the Russian army commit crimes against humanity. Yet, instead of punishing those responsible for the atrocities in our international system of justice, we stood by, silently watching as the Kremlin ordered the murders of those who had openly opposed them in Russia and abroad.\n\nAmong those who were killed is Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered for informing the world on the reality of the Second Chechen War. Natalya Estemirova, a human rights activist, was also assassinated in Chechnya for similar reasons. We all remember the murder of Boris Nemtsov, who was killed for his reports on the Russian military intervention in Donbas. The closure of Memorial – an organisation that investigated Stalin’s brutal crimes – should have been no surprise as the totalitarian regime began closing its ranks internally.\n\nAnd while we may have been shocked by all these events and even expressed our anger publicly, we did very little to prevent them from happening again. Some in the West believed that these were even isolated incidents or that business with Russia did not necessarily mean business with those killers responsible for these horrible yet largely ignored crimes. Russian disinformation and propaganda fuelled ignorance and provided a cover for those who valued business over morals, and profits over lives.\n\nInformation pervasion\n\nRussia also gained a foothold in many of our own countries, often exploiting corrupt politicians and disseminating state-sponsored fake news and disinformation that inflamed internal divides. By allowing Russia Today, later RT, and Sputnik, primarily broadcast in English (the global lingua franca, but also translated into many other languages), to frequent our media landscape, we believed that we were adhering to our cherished democratic values like freedom of speech. Under the impression that these channels were offering “a different perspective”, we allowed Putin’s sick vision of restoring the Russian empire to take root in our societies and Kremlin-created narratives meant to divide us to enter into our discourse.\n\nThus, in 2014, instead of talking about the Russian war against Ukraine, we could read about a “civil conflict” in Ukraine; “the Ukrainian crisis”; and the problem of “Ukrainian nationalists”. These phrases, however, as many finally learnt in 2021 and 2022, were only to serve as a background for a much stronger lie. It was uttered by Putin himself and used as a pretext to start the current war. He falsely stated that Ukraine has no historical right to exist and even requires “denazification”.\n\nThe “denazification” of a state whose president is Jewish is obviously a groundless argument. Yet, we have to admit that many politicians in our own countries have long been under the influence of Russia. Thanks to this, we have witnessed many destructive trends that have severely damaged not only the operations of our state institutions and political processes, but also brought on deep divisions within our highly polarised societies. Almost any issue that requires a democratic choice has become prey to Russian manipulation via its disinformation machine, online trolls, bots and useful idiots. This is true for elections, but also COVID-19, Brexit, abortion rights, race relations, LGBTQ+ rights and many other issues. Instead of adequately diagnosing the sources of these divisions, we eagerly joined in; fanning the flames that were stoked by Russia’s interference. While we cannot blame Russia for everything wrong within our own societies, we do need to acknowledge all the risks it poses to our social cohesion through echo-chambers, bubbles and cancel culture.\n\nOur money also allowed Russia to grow. We nourished the monster in the Kremlin through vast and numerous business deals that we now find so difficult to free ourselves from. For some, business with Russia is still acceptable even if their daily news reports highlight the inhumane blockade of Mariupol and the shelling of breadlines in Kharkiv. Several EU member states remain prone to pressure from Russia, having ignored repeated calls for the diversification of their energy supply.\n\nWho provoked who?\n\nUnfortunately, there are still commentators, politicians and opinion makers in the West who continue to act as useful idiots for the Kremlin by claiming that it is NATO’s fault Russia invaded Ukraine. They say that NATO provoked the conflict and Russia is only acting in its own self-defence. Is Moscow defending itself by brutally killing civilians in the thousands? By destroying entire cities and forcibly moving their populations to various regions in Russia, including the Far East? How we can even point the finger at anyone else beyond Putin and his regime is still a deep-seated mystery. Besides, NATO does not “expand”; it has an “open door policy”. In other words, if a country wishes or decides that it is in its own best interests to join the Alliance, NATO will welcome them into the family after it conforms to the highest western standards. Seeing how Russia assaults those who even consider joining NATO, we should not doubt the importance of the Alliance. What if Poland did not decide to join NATO in 1999 and waited to announce such intentions until 2015? It would not take much imagination to fathom how Putin would have reacted in such a scenario. The argument that NATO provoked Russia is another example of the Russian narrative being regurgitated in mainstream western media. The truth is, however, that we did not take enough action. This is what ultimately encouraged Putin to act in such a brutal manner.\n\nNot that long ago, we were disgusted by the revelations in Alexei Navalny’s film about Putin’s mansion. But no one really bothered to speak up against the gas pipeline that allowed him to reach such levels of wealth. Many in the West in fact never felt obliged enough to see their business with Russia as an act of corruption. Yet many of them were eager to point to Ukraine as being corrupt and hence unable to “meet European democratic standards”. We expected Ukrainians to listen to our guidelines on what modern statehood should look like, but their arguments (or those in Poland or the Baltic states) on why Nord Stream 2 is dangerous for the region and our security went ignored, written off as wild “Russophobia”.\n\nNow, Europe and the West face their greatest challenge since the end of the Cold War and perhaps since the outbreak of the Second World War. The refugee crisis that the Russian forces have now set in motion through their indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine will be an immense and lengthy test. The tactics of total war have already forced a large percentage of Ukraine’s future beyond its borders. It must remain a priority for the international community to provide them with care and safety. Pushing these masses of civilians into Poland, Romania and Moldova in particular is also part of the Russian strategy to put these countries under pressure, sow divisions and exhaust resources. These countries and their allies must quickly come to terms with the fact that they are now on the frontline.\n\nTowards a common victory\n\nNow, of course, we have reached a stage of western unity and solidarity with Ukraine. The response by the transatlantic community to Russia’s invasion was impressive. Putin certainly did not expect such a reaction. A new emboldened sanctions regime has been introduced and Nord Stream 2 has finally been put on hold (yet for how long, we do not know). How this war will end depends on many factors. The brave and courageous Ukrainians defending their home, led and inspired by their democratically elected president, convince us that victory is not only possible but likely. However, peace at any cost cannot be the western-imposed solution to Putin’s war. Ukraine has already sacrificed too much. It has lost too many husbands, wives, sons, daughters and grandparents. Instead, peace can only come with Ukraine’s victory; its territorial integrity intact and its future bright and prosperous.\n\nThe Russian totalitarian regime must be held to account for its crimes in this war. This includes an end to Vladimir Putin’s rule in the Kremlin. A return to business as usual, drunk on Russian disinformation and corrupted by dirty money – to a place where we were before February 24th – is no longer possible. There is only one outcome: Ukraine’s victory and the renewal of the West and its promise of a new future. The price that Ukraine is paying today cannot and will not be made in vain.

How can it be otherwise?" Lavrov said. "NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war," he added.\n\nIn another interview late Monday, Lavrov vowed peace talks with Ukraine would continue even as he warned of a "real" danger of the conflict in Ukraine escalating into a third world war.\n\n"The danger is serious, it is real, you can\'t underestimate it," Lavrov told the Interfax news agency.\n\nThe foreign minister also told Russian state television that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nWhen asked if the current situation in Ukraine was comparable to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Lavrov said that "back then there were actually only a few rules, written rules."\n\nHowever, Lavrov said that during that time, there were "clear rules of conduct" and a channel of communication between the leaders of the US and Soviet Union that doesn\'t exist today.\n\nThe foreign minister also criticized Ukraine\'s approach to negotiations following Russia\'s invasion of the country on February 24. Lavrov accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of "pretending" to negotiate.\n\nHe told Russian news agencies the content of peace talks would depend on the military situation and added, "Good will has its limits.

However, she said tough decisions now could reduce the likelihood of an attack against the alliance further down the line.\n\n"Germany has said Article 5 is ironclad and Germany will come to help if necessary, but then it is also important for everybody, including Germany, to make those decisions so that we make NATO stronger — and there will be no need to come to any help at all."\n\n"Of course, gas or oil could be expensive, but freedom is really priceless," Kallas said, adding: "Strong sanctions, hitting hard, would be something that would maybe end this war."\n\nNo agreement with Russia on Mariupol corridor — Ukrainian deputy PM\n\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that Kyiv had not reached any agreement with Moscow on establishing a humanitarian corridor out of the southeastern city of Mariupol.\n\nRussia said it would open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol.\n\n"It is important to understand that a humanitarian corridor opens by the agreement of both sides," Vereshchuk said on Telegram.

Click here for updates from April 24.\n\nMariupol Officials Say New Mass Grave Found\n\nOfficials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new mass grave has been identified north of the city.\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) north of Mariupol.\n\nSatellite photos released over the past several days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nMariupol has been decimated by fierce fighting over the past two months. The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk.

Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:40'}

But the Ukrainians, aided by Western weapons, bogged down President Vladimir Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its focus is in the eastern region of the Donbas, but one senior military official says it also wants to control southern Ukraine. While both sides said the campaign in the east has begun, it has yet to gather steam.\n\nA small group of Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces, and keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor on Monday for them to leave.\n\nRussian tanks roll along a street in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Mariupol, Ukraine (Alexei Alexandrov/AP)\n\nBut for now, the British Defence Ministry said that Ukrainian forces have repelled numerous assaults in the past week and “inflicted significant cost on Russian forces”. It said, so far, Russia has “yet to achieve a significant breakthrough” since shifting its focus to the Donbas.\n\nInstead, Russian missiles and war planes struck far behind the front line of that offensive on Monday.\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday, including a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nSerhiy Borzov, the governor of Ukraine’s central Vinnytsia region, said there were casualties after rocket strikes targeting “critical infrastructure”. It was not clear if that referred to the attacks on the railways.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries.\n\nA Russian news report said that another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire early Monday.\n\nIn footage later released by the Ukrainian presidency of the meeting with top US officials, Mr Blinken praised the “extraordinary courage and leadership and success that you’ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression”.\n\nMr Austin said at the news conference that “the world has been inspired” by Ukraine in the war and that America will continue its support. “What you’ve done in repelling the Russians in the Battle of Kyiv is extraordinary,” he said.\n\nMr Zelensky had announced on Saturday that he would meet the US officials in Kyiv on Sunday, but Joe Biden’s administration refused to confirm that and declined to discuss details of a possible visit even though planning had been under way for more than a week.\n\nJournalists who travelled to Poland with Mr Austin and Mr Blinken were barred from reporting on the trip until it ended, were not allowed to accompany them on their overland journey into Ukraine, and were prohibited from specifying where in south-east Poland they waited for the Cabinet members to return. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon cited security concerns.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nSuch financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need.\n\nThe new money, along with the sale of 165 million dollars (£128 million) in non-US made ammunition that is compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use, takes the total amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to 3.7 billion dollars (£2.9 billion) since the invasion, officials said.\n\nUS officials said they believed the new assistance would satisfy at least some of the Ukrainians’ urgent pleas for more help. New artillery, including howitzers, continues to be delivered at a rapid pace to Ukraine’s military, which is being trained on its use in neighbouring countries, the officials said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\nMs Brink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the US Senate.\n\nMr Blinken also told Ukraine’s foreign minister that the small staff from the US embassy in Kyiv, which has relocated to Poland from temporary offices in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, will begin making day trips to Lviv in the coming days.\n\nOfficials said the US had accelerated its review of security conditions in the capital and that the State Department will reopen the embassy there as soon as the situation allows.\n\nMr Biden has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of genocide for the destruction and death wrought on Ukraine. On Thursday, the US leader said he would provide a new package of 800 million dollars (£623 million) in military aid to Ukraine that included heavy artillery and drones.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nFrom Poland, Mr Blinken plans to return to Washington while Mr Austin will head to Ramstein in Germany for a meeting Tuesday of Nato defence ministers and other donor countries.\n\nThat discussion will look at battlefield updates from the ground, additional security assistance for Ukraine and longer-term defence needs in Europe, including how to step up military production to fill gaps caused by the war in Ukraine, officials said. More than 20 nations are expected to send representatives to the meeting.', 'image': 'https://jerseyeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25144250/Img33212545-4.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:53'}

"We are here to support you in any way possible."\n\nSaid Blinken: "The reason we\'re back is because of you, because of the extraordinary courage, leadership and success that you\'ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression."\n\nUS officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for Zelensky\'s government and other countries in the region. An extra $322 million in military aid for Ukraine would take total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, one official said.\n\n"It will provide support for capabilities Ukraine needs, especially the fight in the Donbas," the official said. It would also help Ukraine\'s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defence systems -- essentially NATO capable systems, the official added on condition of anonymity.\n\nWestern arms for Ukraine have infuriated Moscow. Russia\'s ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note stressing "the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice".\n\nThe meeting between the US delegation and Ukraine\'s leaders ran for three hours, or more than double the allotted time, a US official said.\n\n"In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded," Blinken told a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine\'s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nJust weeks ago, Kyiv was a frontline city under curfew and bombardment, with tens of thousands of Russian troops massing on its northern outskirts. Residents spent nights huddled in its metro stations, sheltering from artillery.\n\nToday, the nearest Russian troops are hundreds of miles away, normal life is returning to the capital, Western leaders have been visiting and countries are reopening their embassies.\n\nBlinken said US diplomats would first return to Lviv in the west and should be back in Kyiv within weeks.\n\nBut despite Ukraine having repelled the assault on Kyiv, the war is far from over. Russia has regrouped its forces and sent more troops in to eastern Ukraine. Last week it launched a massive assault there in an attempt to capture eastern provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nRAILWAY STATIONS HIT\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying. Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot. There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\'s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nIn a daily update on the conflict, Britain\'s defence ministry said Russia had only made minor advances in some parts of Donbas.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nIn an emotional address at Kyiv\'s 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral to mark the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday, Zelensky said his nation would overcome "dark times".\n\nWAR GRINDS ON\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country, where the war grinds on relentlessly.\n\nSome 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\nRussia also fired rockets at two towns in the central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\nUkraine\'s general staff described Russian shelling and assaults along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steel works in Mariupol where the last Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a city destroyed during two months of Russian siege and bombardment.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation", denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, Britain\'s The Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.', 'image': 'https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/04/25/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg/BINARY/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:37'}

However, she will not be stationed in the country just yet, but will instead be making “day trips” from Poland to Lvov in western Ukraine until Washington reopens its embassy in Kiev.\n\nSunday’s visit by Blinken and Austin was kept secret for “security reasons” until the pair had already left the country on Monday. The meeting also yielded a promise to send Ukraine hundreds of millions of dollars more in weaponry, including “nonstandard ammunition” and air defense system upgrades aimed at bringing the eastern European nation to NATO standards. The US has shipped over $3 billion of "security assistance" to Ukraine since the start of the Biden administration.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly condemned the arms supplies to Kiev sent by the US and other NATO countries, saying they only destabilize the situation on the ground and hamper the prospects for peace. It also insists that Western convoys become legitimate targets for the Russian forces once they cross into Ukrainian territory.\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

In response, he started out with the established administration line about helping Ukraine retain its sovereignty and defend its territory.\n\nThen Austin added a second goal: “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.” That meant Russia should “not have the capability to very quickly reproduce” the forces and equipment that had been lost in Ukraine.\n\nThe UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, estimated those losses on Monday as a quarter of Russia’s pre-invasion strength, with more than 2,000 armoured vehicles knocked out, including at least 530 tanks, as well as 60 aircraft.\n\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who travelled with Austin to see Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, agreed with his formulation of US objectives, saying: “I think the secretary said it very well”.\n\nThe two officials were talking as the first howitzers from the latest tranche of US military supplies began arriving in Ukraine, and $165m in supplies of “non-standard” ex-Soviet compatible ammunition was announced.\n\n01:01 ‘Russia is failing’ in its war aims, says US secretary of state Antony Blinken – video\n\nThe remarks suggested that even if Russian forces withdrew or were expelled from the Ukrainian territory they have occupied since 24 February, the US and its allies would seek to maintain sanctions with the aim of stopping Russia reconstituting its forces.\n\nIt also indicated Washington is taking a position in an internal debate within Nato on whether to use the opportunity of Vladimir Putin’s strategic blunder in Ukraine to try to hobble his ability to threaten other countries in the future.\n\n“The balance in Nato itself has shifted,” Rajan Menon, the director of the grand strategy programme at the Defense Priorities thinktank, said. “The argument now seems to be this is not just about Ukraine; it’s about a larger problem, that is the threat that Russia poses to Europe as a whole. And if you look at it that way, then these comments begin to make sense.”\n\n“The Russians are on the retreat, so you have this flush of optimism which has moved the goalposts,” Menon, professor emeritus in international relations at Columbia University, said. “Once Washington says it, those in Nato who want the war to be about that are empowered, because what the US says matters.”\n\nA European diplomat said it was unclear whether the remarks reflected a new decision or “a clearer articulation” of an existing position.\n\n“I think it’s fundamentally about trying to get on the front foot in this crisis. There’s a lot of domestic criticism of the administration for being passive,” the diplomat said. “All of this is swirling around at the moment in the administration, as they work out exactly how forward they want to be.”\n\nIf the remarks do indeed represent the Biden administration’s aims, there is a separate question of whether it was sensible to declare them so bluntly. It arguably weakens Russia’s incentive to withdraw, reinforces Moscow’s narrative that Nato is waging a proxy war in Ukraine aimed at weakening Russia and even regime change, deepening Putin’s paranoia.\n\n“If I was writing the secretary’s talking points, I would prefer he said: our goal is that Ukraine wins, rather than our goal is to weaken Russia because they are two sides of the same coin, but one would have been much more aligned with what the administration has been saying,” said Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, said.\n\n“Certainly this will be used by the Russian state media to double down on the narrative that we’ve already seen from the Russian government, that the US is ‘out to get us’, that they want to destroy Russia,” she said, but added: “Frankly, I don’t think we should worry too much about how this will be spun by the Russian media, because they can spin anything.”\n\nUltimately, Polyakova said, Austin was voicing a widespread feeling about the long-term threat posed by Putin that is increasingly difficult to ignore.\n\n“I think the secretary’s comments were truthful in that it will be in the greater interest of global stability and European security not to have a military aggressive state, bordering Nato or bordering Europe,” she said. “I think that’s very obvious.”', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/277e44afa6fd0828f74d1431f160d2db106f59ad/0_43_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45267daeda292aace8759563906f0877', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:58:47'}

It also condemned the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes and called for anyone detained to be treated humanely in accordance with the requirements of international humanitarian law.\n\nAslin, originally from Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, north England, and Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, east England, are both members of the Ukrainian armed forces. The families said they have both been in Ukraine since 2018, long before the Russian invasion of the eastern European country.\n\nThe pair were captured earlier this month after their unit had to surrender after 48 days of defending Mariupol as they were “running out of ammunition.”\n\nThey later appeared on Russian state TV, asking Johnson to help exchange for them with Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who was arrested by the Ukrainian secret services on April 12. It’s not clear if they were under duress.\n\nBoth appeared to have bruises and Aslin appeared to have been beaten. Their families later said they were in contact with the UK’s Foreign Office to ensure the Russian authorities “meet their obligations to prisoners of war under international law.”\n\nRussia’s foreign ministry on April 21 said “the Russian side [was] taking care of them,” and they were “fed, watered, and given the necessary assistance. Just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained.”\n\nA Russian national flag flies by destroyed buildings in Mariupol, Ukraine, on April 12, 2022.

The International Committee of the Red Cross also recommends not publishing images that identify prisoners of war, or show them in humiliating or degrading situations unless there’s a “compelling public interest” in doing so in accordance with the Geneva Convention.\n\nBut Aslin’s mother Angela and his brother Nathan spoke to TalkTV on Monday, pleading for Johnson’s help. Pinner’s family also previously released a statement through the FCDO, rebuking Russian media’s characterisation of foreign fighters in the Ukrainian military as “mercenaries.”\n\n“I would hope that, at some point, there will be a prisoner swap. However, it’s out of my hands. It is between Ukraine and Russia,” Nathan Aslin told TalkTV.\n\nOutlining his recent phone conversation with his brother, Nathan Aslin told the broadcaster, “It was obvious that he was with the Russian people that were holding him and he was asking for me to contact Boris [Johnson] to get this prison swap done. And to keep on asking for this swap.”\n\nAsked what he would say to the prime minister, Nathan said: “Act now when you got the time to act. You’ve got two British citizens on the line, being forced to say whatever the Russians are putting in [their] mouths at gunpoint, whether they show it on the camera or not. And it’s a moral obligation to do something about it.”\n\nAngela Aslin added: “I would like to hope that Boris will help. And talk to the Ukraine government [and] embassy. There can be something sorted out so that these two guys can come home.”\n\nAslin moved to Ukraine in 2018 with his Ukrainian fiancée and now holds British and Ukrainian citizenship. He previously fought the ISIS terrorist group with Kurdish militia People’s Defense Units in Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nPinner’s family previously said that the former British Army soldier decided to relocate to Ukraine in 2019 “to use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military.”\n\nThe statement said Pinner “enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country” where he also met his Ukrainian wife.\n\nForeign Office minister James Cleverly on Tuesday confirmed that Aslin and Pinner should be treated as prisoners of war.\n\nAsked about the pair by Aslin’s local MP—former housing minister Robert Jenrick—Cleverly told Parliament he had discussed the issue of foreign volunteer fighters with the Ukrainian government.\n\n“They are clear, and we are clear, that those fighting under the Ukrainian flag for the Ukrainian armed forces in the defence of Ukraine should be treated as Ukrainian military and as prisoners of war, with all the protections that the international humanitarian law affords to those individuals,” Cleverly said.\n\nThe UK government advises against all travel to Ukraine.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.2.66462486.jpg-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:36'}

When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world," said the Ukrainian president.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskyy also mentioned the morning air raids in the Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv and Odesa regions. However, he did not provide any information on the rocket attacks reported at train stations in western Ukraine.\n\nUkraine reports deadly rocket attacks in central Vinnytsia region\n\nTwo towns in Ukraine\'s central Vinnytsia region came under fire on Monday, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, according to local officials.\n\nThe cities of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn were struck by "rocket fire," local governor Serhiy Borzov said on Facebook. The attacks reportedly targeted "critical infrastructure" in the region, he said. Both cities are important railway junctions on the route from Kyiv to western Ukraine.\n\nBorzov also said the strikes caused deaths and injuries, but he did not give any numbers.\n\nRailway stations struck by missiles — Ukrainian railway chief\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine have been hit by missile strikes, according to the head of the country\'s railways, Oleksandr Kamyshin.\n\n"Russian forces are systematically destroying the infrastructure of our railways," Kamyshin said on his Telegram channel.\n\nKamyshin added that trains are being forced to alter routes and schedules for security reasons.\n\nReports of missile attacks also emerged in the western city of Lviv and southwestern city of Vinnytsia.\n\nAccording to Maksym Kozytskyy, the governor of the western Lviv region, an explosion occurred on Monday morning at the traction substation of the Krasne railway station as a result of a missile strike.\n\nOne missile was destroyed by Ukrainian air defense. The missiles flew to western Ukraine from the southeast, Kozytskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe added that the missiles were likely fired from Russian strategic aircraft. He had no information yet about possible victims.\n\nKyiv needs long-range fires and tanks — US Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed and that Kyiv now needs long-range fires for both artillery and missiles, as well as tanks.\n\nAustin said that he and Blinken had discussed "security assistance" and "training" with Ukrainian officials. He said that the meeting was to talk about things that would "enable us to win the current fight and also build for tomorrow."\n\n"We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," Austin said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke to reporters following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nAustin is scheduled to go to the Ramstein US Air Base in western Germanyon Tuesday to speak with allies on how best to support Ukraine.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense said it is difficult for the US to track what happens to weapons transferred to Ukraine as there are no US forces on the ground, but added that he spoke to Kyiv to make sure weapons were tracked as best as possible.\n\nRussia \'failing\' in its war aims — Blinken\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press conference following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Russia has been "failing" when it came to its war aims in Ukraine, while Kyiv is "succeeding."\n\n"Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine," Blinken said. "That has failed."\n\nBlinken said that Russia\'s military was underperforming and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin\'s on the scene," Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees "final success."\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "things are beginning to get back to normal" in Kyiv, but noted that "that\'s in stark contrast to what\'s going on" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas — UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain\'s defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, "Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. Britain\'s defense ministry believes this "reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia\'s losses from the domestic population."\n\nWatch video 01:57 Ukraine war: Russia\'s renewed ambitions in the east\n\nRussia increased military spending to $65.9 billion in 2021\n\nWorld military expenditure surpassed the $2 trillion mark (€1.8 trillion) for the first time in 2021, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe report released on Monday shows Russia increased its military expenditure to $65.9 billion in 2021 to reach 4.1% of its GDP.\n\nIt was the third consecutive year of growth and Russia\'s military spending. Moscow was the fifth largest spender in the world, behind the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nUkraine\'s military spending has risen by 72% since Russia\'s annexation of Crimea in 2014. It spent $5.9 billion, or 3.2% of the country\'s GDP, in 2021.\n\nTotal spending in Europe in 2021 amounted to $418 billion, 3% higher than in 2020 and 19% higher than in 2012. Many European countries have contributed substantial military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, and third-largest spender Germany boosted its military aid budget to €2 billion a little over a week ago.\n\nThe United States saw a drop in expenditure in 2021 due to a drop in American spending on research and development. The US is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, having provided an additional $800 million in mid-April and another $322 million this Sunday.\n\nWatch video 02:24 US approves more military aid to Ukraine\n\nBlinken and Austin announce aid, diplomatic surge\n\nThe United States will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military financing and has approved a $165 million sale of ammunition to the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe announcement came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt was the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war.\n\nThe US officials also pledged further assistance worth $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries, with the $322 million earmarked specifically for Kyiv.\n\nThe new money brings the total amount of US military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said.\n\nThe two returned overland to Poland after their meeting.

(AP Photo/Felipe Dana) (Felipe Dana)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine — (AP) — Russia unleashed a string of attacks Monday against rail and fuel installations deep inside Ukraine, far from the front lines of Moscow’s new eastern offensive, as Russia’s top diplomat warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.”\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, moved to rush more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from the Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n“Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared, a day after he and the U.S. secretary of defense made a bold visit to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nBlinken said Washington approved a $165 million sale of ammunition — non-U.S. ammo, mainly if not entirely for Ukraine\'s Soviet-era weapons — and will also provide more than $300 million in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin took his comments further, saying that while the U.S. wants to see Ukraine remain a sovereign, democratic country, it also wants "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nAustin’s comments about weakening Russia appeared to represent a shift in broader U.S. strategic goals. Previously, the U.S. position had been that the goal of American military aid was to help Ukraine win and to defend Ukraine’s NATO neighbors against Russian threats.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said weapons supplied by Western countries “will be a legitimate target," adding that Russian forces had already targeted weapons warehouses in western Ukraine.\n\n“Everyone is reciting incantations that in no case can we allow World War III,” Lavrov said in a wide-ranging interview on Russian television. He accused Ukrainian leaders of provoking Russia by asking NATO to become involved in the conflict.\n\nBy providing weapons, NATO forces are “pouring oil on the fire,” he said, according to a transcript on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website.\n\nRegarding the possibility of a nuclear confrontation, Lavrov said: “I would not want to see these risks artificially inflated now, when the risks are rather significant.”\n\n“The danger is serious," he said. "It is real. It should not be underestimated.”\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv, the capital. But the Ukrainians, with the help of Western weapons, thwarted the push and forced President Vladimir Putin\'s troops to retreat.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is to take the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking industrial region in eastern Ukraine. While both sides say the campaign in the east is underway, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and warplanes striking far behind the front lines in an effort to thwart Ukrainian efforts to marshal supplies for the fight.\n\nFive railroad stations in central and western Ukraine were hit, and one worker was killed, said Oleksandr Kamyshin, head of Ukraine\'s state railway. The bombardment included a missile attack near Lviv, the western city close to the Polish border that has been swelled by Ukrainians fleeing the fighting elsewhere around the country.\n\nUkrainian authorities said at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk, in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. general who was NATO’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said the latest strikes against fuel depots are part of a strategy to deplete key Ukrainian war resources. The strikes against rail targets, on the other hand, are a newer tactic, he said.\n\n“I think they’re doing it for the legitimate reason of trying to interdict the flow of supplies to the front,” he said. “The illegitimate reason is they know people are trying to leave the country, and this is just another intimidation, terrorist tactic to make them not have faith and confidence in traveling on the rails.”\n\nPhillips P. O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nIn Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova that sits along the Ukrainian border, several explosions believed caused by rocket-propelled grenades hit the territory\'s Ministry of State Security. There was no immediate claim of responsibility or reports of injuries. Transnistria is a strip of land with about 470,000 people and about 1,500 Russian troops based there.\n\nMoldova\'s Foreign Ministry said “the aim of today’s incident is to create pretexts for straining the security situation in the Transnistrian region." The U.S. warned previously that Russia may launch “false-flag” attacks against its own side to create a pretext for invading other nations.\n\nLast week, Rustam Minnekayev, a Russian military commander, said the Kremlin wants full control of southern Ukraine, which he said would open the way to Transnistria.\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic southern port city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas. Over the weekend, Russian forces launched new airstrikes on the Azovstal plant to try to dislodge the holdouts.\n\nSome 1,000 civilians were also said to be taking shelter at the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor Monday for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with skepticism by Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nThe city council and mayor of Mariupol said a new mass grave has been identified about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities were trying to estimate the number of victims. It was at least the third new mass grave discovered in Russian-controlled areas near Mariupol in the last week.\n\nMariupol has been gutted by bombardment and fierce street fighting over the past two months. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, the capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said his country\'s goal is to maintain resistance and “make the occupiers’ stay in our land even more intolerable,” while Russia drains its resources.\n\nA top Ukrainian official cast doubt on the prospect of further talks between the two countries. Recent sessions in Istanbul ended without resolution earlier this month.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview that any negotiations other than talks between Zelenskyy and Putin would bring little resolution.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective."\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Yuras Karmanau and Jon Gambrell in Lviv, Ukraine, and AP staff around the world contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\'s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

On Saturday, Ukrainian officials issued similar warnings and said Russian forces were laying siege to the plant.\n\nPope Francis appeals for truce again\n\nThe blue and yellow Ukrainian flag flew among those gathered on St. Peter\'s Square in the Vatican this Orthodox Easter weekend as Pope Francis appealed again for a truce in Ukraine.\n\nHe called for an easing of "the suffering of exhausted people."\n\nFrancis added that, "Instead of halting, the war has become worse."\n\nEchoing the calls of senior Ukrainian government officials, Francis said, "I renew the appeal for an Easter truce, the smallest tangible sign of a willingness for peace."\n\nRussia\'s US envoy says consulates\' bank accounts closed\n\nRussian ambassador Anatoly Antonov said Sunday that the work of Russian diplomatic missions in the US was essentially "blockaded" by US government entities.\n\n"Accounts of our two consulates in Houston and New York have been closed by Bank of America," Antonov was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency.\n\nHe also said Russian diplomatic sites were receiving threats via telephone and in the mail.\n\nOSCE says members captured in Donetsk and Luhansk\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said it is "extremely concerned" about the detention of several members of its monitoring mission in the eastern part of the country.\n\nIn a brief tweet, the Vienna-based organization said several of its mission members "have been deprived of their liberty in Donetsk and Luhansk" and that OSCE was "using all available channels to facilitate their release."\n\nAn OSCE spokesperson failed to provide specifics such as how many Ukrainian nationals involved in the monitoring mission had been detained or when or who may be holding them.

According to the Interfax news agency, the country\'s media supervisor Roskomnadzor has blocked two of its pages with information about the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian prosecutors demanded the move on Saturday. As the site uses https network protocol, barring the access to those pages has reportedly caused the entire site to be inaccessible in Russia.\n\nPreviously, Russian grandmaster Sergei Karjakin had called for the pages with information about what Russia calls its "special military operations" in Ukraine to be blocked.\n\nRussia claims it struck arms depots in the Kharkiv region\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense said Sunday that it had struck nine Ukrainian military targets overnight.\n\nIncluded among those targets were four arms depots in the Kharkiv region where artillery is stored and a facility producing military grade explosives in Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nWatch video 02:39 A village in Ukraine marks Good Friday in wartime\n\nUkrainian negotiator calls for a \'real Easter truce\'\n\nMykhailo Podoliak, the senior Ukrainian negotiator and presidential advisor, urged a "real Easter truce" as both Ukraine and Russia mark Orthodox Easter.\n\nOn Twitter, Podoliak also urged a humanitarian corridor out of the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\n"Russia is continuously attacking the Mariupol Azovstal. The place where our civilians and military are located, is shelled with heavy air bombs and artillery."\n\nPodoliak urged Russia to "think of the remnants of its reputation."\n\nUkraine says Russia deployed Iskander-M missile launchers near border\n\nRussia has moved Iskander-M missile launchers to sites within 60 kilometers (40 miles) of Ukraine\'s border, said the General Staff of Ukraine\'s Armed Forces.\n\nThe mobile ballistic Iskander system has a range of up to 500 kilometers and is armed with two guided missiles capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads.\n\n"The enemy has increased the number of troops in (Russia\'s) Belgorod region by transferring and concentrating additional units," Ukraine\'s Armed Forces said in their daily morning update.\n\nWatch video 03:24 Missile attack on Odesa during Orthodox Easter\n\nZelenskyy hopes for \'eternal harmony\' following peace in Ukraine\n\nIn his message for Orthodox Easter, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the holiday is a reminder that "light wins over darkness," therefore "Ukraine must win!"\n\nZelenskyy said Ukrainians were praying for a day of "great peace" in Ukraine which would bring "eternal harmony and prosperity."\n\nThe politician recorded the video message at the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kyiv where "a thousand years ago, on the field of the holy battle, the army of Kievan Rus-Ukraine defeated the [medival Turkic nations of] Pechenegs," Zelenskyy noted.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine trace their countries\' origins to the medieval state of Kievan Rus. The Kremlin has argued that because of this, Ukraine\'s national identity is virtually identical to Russia\'s; Kyiv strongly objects.\n\nMeanwhile, Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world\'s Eastern Orthodox Christians, called from Istanbul for humanitarian corridors to be opened in Ukraine where he said "an indescribable human tragedy is unfolding."\n\n"We call once again for an immediate end to the fratricidal war, which, like any war, undermines human dignity," Bartholomew added.\n\nSwitzerland impedes German arms deliveries: report\n\nSwitzerland has blocked the re-export from Germany to Ukraine of Swiss-produced ammunition used in German-made Marder infantry fighting vehicles, according to the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.\n\nThe move by Switzerland, which maintains a neutral status, has held up arms deliveries by Germany at a time when Berlin is already under fire for failing to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons to help fight off Russia\'s invasion of the country.\n\nSwitzerland has gone against previous practice and adopted EU sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for its invasion, but has insisted its neutrality does not allow it to send arms to conflict zones.

It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets.

In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense.

And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow.

The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield.

How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes.

Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

But Johnson insisted that the West did not need to make concessions despite the nuclear threat.\n\n“People say we have to make a concession, we have to worry about what Putin might do because of the risk of his defeat,” Johnson said. “I think he has got a lot of space, he has got a lot of room for manoeuvre.”\n\n10:02pm: Gazprom has informed Bulgaria, Poland of halt to gas supplies from Wednesday\n\nRussia’s Gazprom has informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it will halt gas supplies as of Wednesday, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ministry said that along with state gas companies it has taken steps to find alternative arrangements for the supply of natural gas and to deal with the situation.\n\nIt said for the time being no restrictions in the gas consumption in the Balkan country which meets over 90 percent of its gas needs with Gazprom’s imports, were required.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Polish officials had said Russia is suspending natural gas deliveries to Poland beginning Wednesday morning after that country refused a demand to pay for its supplies in Russian rubles\n\nPoland’s state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Russian gas giant Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop on Wednesday.\n\nPolish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources. She said the country has been effectively independent when it comes to Russian gas for some time.\n\n“There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes,” Moskwa tweeted.\n\n9:39pm IAEA says it has agreed with Ukraine to help repair damage to Chernobyl\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday said he had agreed with Ukraine to help repair the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant after it was occupied by Russian troops.\n\n“It is visible that there is damage and we are assessing that,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told a news conference in Kyiv after visiting the station.\n\nThirty-six years ago, on April 26, 1986, an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction destroyed the reactor in an accident that was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities.\n\nRussian troops took over the site on February 24 of this year, the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, taking Ukrainian soldiers prisoner and detaining civilian staff.\n\nThe occupation lasted until the end of March and raised global fears of nuclear leaks.\n\nRussia’s temporary takeover of the Chernobyl site was “very, very dangerous” and raised radiation levels but they have now returned to “normal”, Grossi said during his visit there earlier on Tuesday.\n\n9:17pm: US warns not to \'escalate tensions\' after Moldova region blasts\n\nThe United States on Tuesday warned against attempts to "escalate tensions" after a series of blasts in a Russian-backed separatist region of Moldova, which borders Ukraine.\n\nWhile stopping short of backing Kyiv\'s contention that Russia was responsible for the incidents in Transnistria, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters: "We do remain concerned about any potential attempts to escalate tensions."\n\n"We reiterate the Moldovan government\'s call for calm in response to these incidents and we fully support Moldova\'s territorial integrity and sovereignty," Price said.\n\nThe mysterious recent blasts which targeted the state security ministry, a radio tower and military unit came days after a senior Russian commander claimed Russian speakers in Moldova were being oppressed.\n\nRussian forces have been positioned in Transnistria for three decades after the predominantly Russian-speaking region seceded from the former Soviet republic, a decision not recognized internationally.\n\n9:04pm: US says talk of Lavrov\'s comments on nuclear escalation is irresponsible\n\nThe US State Department on Tuesday criticized Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s comments about the potential of a nuclear war, saying loose talk about nuclear escalation was the "height of irresponsibility."\n\nLavrov warned the West on Monday not to underestimate the elevated risks of nuclear conflict over Ukraine and said he viewed NATO as being "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia by supplying Kyiv with weaponry.\n\n8:10pm: Putin agrees to United Nations, Red Cross help to evacuate civilians from Azovstal plant, UN says\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin agreed “in principle” to UN and International Committee for the Red Cross involvement in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in Ukraine’s Mariupol, the United Nations said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n“Follow-on discussions will be had with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Russian Defence Ministry,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement after Putin met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Moscow.\n\n7:44pm: Putin tells UN chief he still has \'hope\' for Ukraine talks\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told the visiting UN chief Tuesday that he still had hope for negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject (talks)," Putin told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was visiting Moscow, in televised remarks.\n\nSitting across from Guterres at a long table at the Kremlin, Putin said efforts at talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, speaks to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting in the Kremlin, in Moscow, Russia, on April 26, 2022. © Vladimir Astapkovich, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nPutin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia\'s military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.\n\nGuterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (see 2:02pm, below) for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\n6:45pm: Blinken says Putin not \'serious\' about Ukraine diplomacy\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the Ukraine war, despite a series of international efforts.\n\n“We’ve seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: “Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table.”\n\nBlinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlinken hailed what he saw on the trip and said that the US was speeding up arms deliveries, with the process now often taking only 72 hours after Ukraine sends requests.\n\n6:10pm: Germany confirms plans to send Ukraine tanks, in policy shift\n\nGermany said Tuesday it would send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a clear switch in Berlin’s cautious policy on military backing for Kyiv that was welcomed by the United States.\n\nThe government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the US Ramstein airbase.\n\nThe move comes after heavy criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to Ukraine, despite announcing a “turning point” in German defence policy in response to Russia’s invasion.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the pledge to send “some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems”, the English name for the weapons, was “especially welcome”.\n\n5:19pm: US Defence Secretary says US, allies to meet monthly on arming Ukraine\n\nThe United States and its allies will meet once a month to discuss Ukraine\'s defence needs to battle invading Russian troops, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.\n\n"Today\'s gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine\'s self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\n4:53pm: FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg on the fallout over blasts in Transnistria, Moldova\n\n02:48 © FRANCE 24\n\n4:08pm: Putin, Erdogan discuss humanitarian corridors in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow’s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin statement, the leaders in a phone call talked about “efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors”.\n\nThis came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.\n\nThe Kremlin said Erdogan asked Putin about the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe Russian leader told him that “the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there”.\n\n3:09pm: Nearly 5.3 million flee Ukraine war as refugees, up more than 32,000 since Monday\n\nNearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.\n\nIn total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 32,753 over Monday\'s figure.\n\nWhile the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday (see 11:31am, below) that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.\n\n2:02 pm: Guterres says Russia, UN have \'very different\' views of events in Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had "very frank" discussions with Lavrov. He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Le Drian “reiterated France\'s request for the free movement of civilians and free access for humanitarian aid in Mariupol, as in the rest of Ukraine”, the statement noted.\n\nFrance is delivering Caesar cannons with a range of 40 kilometres (25 miles) to Ukraine and is among 40 countries attending the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group meeting hosted by the US at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nJ’ai souhaité confirmer à mon homologue ukrainien @DmytroKuleba que la France maintiendrait son appui déterminé à l’Ukraine face à la guerre à laquelle elle est confrontée : assistance financière, sanctions, équipements de défense, lutte contre l’impunité. pic.twitter.com/9OgtKltUar — Jean-Yves Le Drian (@JY_LeDrian) April 26, 2022\n\n10:32 am: ‘Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine’: US defence chief Austin\n\nOpening the gathering of representatives of more than 40 countries at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called on members of the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group to arrive at “a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to move heaven and earth so that we can meet them”.\n\nAustin, who is chairing the meeting at the US air base, said Kyiv had done “an impressive job defending its sovereignty against Russia’s unprovoked invasion”, adding: "“Ukraine’s valor and skill will go down in military history.”\n\n“Ukraine has now beaten back the Russian military for 62 days. Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy.

This was, in our judgment, an important moment to be there to have face-to-face conversations in detail.”\n\nMr Zelensky hailed the talks as “encouraging” and “effective”.\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the US is offering “powerful” support to his country. Mr Zelensky added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nHe noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow was also on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nMr Austin said Mr Zelensky’s response to the aid was deep appreciation for what was being given but “he has the mindset that they want to win and we have the mindset that we want to help them win”.\n\nThe talks came as Russia unleashed a string of attacks against Ukrainian rail and fuel facilities on Monday, striking crucial infrastructure far from the front line of its eastern offensive, which Britain said has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, third from left, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, forth from left, meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, fourth from right, in Kyiv (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nMeanwhile, two fires were reported at oil facilities in western Russia.

But the Ukrainians, aided by Western weapons, bogged down President Vladimir Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its focus is in the eastern region of the Donbas, but one senior military official says it also wants to control southern Ukraine. While both sides said the campaign in the east has begun, it has yet to gather steam.\n\nA small group of Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces, and keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor on Monday for them to leave.\n\nRussian tanks roll along a street in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Mariupol, Ukraine (Alexei Alexandrov/AP)\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nBut for now, the British Defence Ministry said that Ukrainian forces have repelled numerous assaults in the past week and “inflicted significant cost on Russian forces”. It said, so far, Russia has “yet to achieve a significant breakthrough” since shifting its focus to the Donbas.\n\nInstead, Russian missiles and war planes struck far behind the front line of that offensive on Monday.\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday, including a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nSerhiy Borzov, the governor of Ukraine’s central Vinnytsia region, said there were casualties after rocket strikes targeting “critical infrastructure”. It was not clear if that referred to the attacks on the railways.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries.\n\nA Russian news report said that another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire early Monday.\n\nIn footage later released by the Ukrainian presidency of the meeting with top US officials, Mr Blinken praised the “extraordinary courage and leadership and success that you’ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression”.\n\n“We got used to seeing you on video around the world, but it’s great, it’s good to see you in person,” he said with a smile.\n\nMr Austin said at the news conference that “the world has been inspired” by Ukraine in the war and that America will continue its support. “What you’ve done in repelling the Russians in the Battle of Kyiv is extraordinary,” he said.\n\nMr Zelensky had announced on Saturday that he would meet the US officials in Kyiv on Sunday, but Joe Biden’s administration refused to confirm that and declined to discuss details of a possible visit even though planning had been under way for more than a week.\n\nJournalists who travelled to Poland with Mr Austin and Mr Blinken were barred from reporting on the trip until it ended, were not allowed to accompany them on their overland journey into Ukraine, and were prohibited from specifying where in south-east Poland they waited for the Cabinet members to return.

The remainder will be split among Nato members and other nations that have provided Ukraine with critical military supplies since the war with Russia began, officials said.\n\nSuch financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need.\n\nThe new money, along with the sale of 165 million dollars (£128 million) in non-US made ammunition that is compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use, takes the total amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to 3.7 billion dollars (£2.9 billion) since the invasion, officials said.\n\nUS officials said they believed the new assistance would satisfy at least some of the Ukrainians’ urgent pleas for more help. New artillery, including howitzers, continues to be delivered at a rapid pace to Ukraine’s military, which is being trained on its use in neighbouring countries, the officials said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\nOn the diplomatic front and as expected, President Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nMs Brink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the US Senate.\n\nMr Blinken also told Ukraine’s foreign minister that the small staff from the US embassy in Kyiv, which has relocated to Poland from temporary offices in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, will begin making day trips to Lviv in the coming days.\n\nOfficials said the US had accelerated its review of security conditions in the capital and that the State Department will reopen the embassy there as soon as the situation allows.\n\nMr Biden has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of genocide for the destruction and death wrought on Ukraine.

Germany announced it cleared the way for delivery of Gepard anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine."This gathering reflects the galvanized world," Austin said in his opening remarks. He added that he wanted officials to leave the meeting "with a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine\'s near-term security requirements because we\'re going to keep moving heaven and earth so that we can meet them."After fierce defense by Ukrainian forces thwarted Russia\'s attempt to take Ukraine\'s capital early in the war, Moscow now says its focus is the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking industrial region in eastern Ukraine. That move is already having a devastating effect on civilians trapped in the conflict.In the small city of Toretsk, residents are struggling to survive, collecting rainwater for cleaning and washing up and fervently hoping for an end to the fighting. "It\'s bad. Very bad. Hopeless," said Andriy Cheromushkin. "You feel so helpless that you don\'t know what you should do or shouldn\'t do. Because if you want to do something, you need some money; and there is no money now."With the potentially pivotal battle for the Donbas underway, the US and its Nato allies are scrambling to get artillery and other heavy weaponry to that area in time to make a difference.German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said her government decided on Monday to clear the delivery of Gepard self-propelled armored anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, though she didn\'t give details. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced mounting pressure, including from within his governing coalition, to approve sending heavy weapons such as tanks and other armored vehicles to Ukraine.Austin also noted Tuesday that more than 30 allies and partners have joined the US in sending security assistance to Ukraine and more than $5 billion worth of equipment committed.The meeting in Germany comes after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , speaking on Russian television, warned weapons supplied by Western countries "will be a legitimate target," and accused Nato of "pouring oil on the fire" with its support for Ukraine, according to a transcript on the Russian Foreign Ministry\'s website.Lavrov also warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict "should not be underestimated." Russian President Vladimir Putin has cited Nato\'s expansion and the risk that Kyiv could join the alliance as reasons for his invasion.UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey rejected Lavrov\'s accusations of Nato aggression as "utter nonsense." He said "the reason there is a war in Ukraine right now is because Russia rolled over the borders of a sovereign country and started to invade their territory."Heappey also said Russia was making "unsound" military decisions and giving away tactical advantages because of Putin\'s desire to secure some kind of victory by May 9, when Russia marks its victory in World War II.Amid the talk of arms shipments, diplomatic efforts to seek an end to the fighting also continued. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met Lavrov on Tuesday and called again for a cease-fire. The UN chief is scheduled to meet Putin later.Elsewhere, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi visited the Chernobyl nuclear plant to deliver equipment, conduct radiological assessments and restore safeguards monitoring systems after tanks and troops churned up highly contaminated soil there in the early hours of Russia\'s invasion in February. His visit comes on the anniversary of the disaster at the plant in 1986, the world\'s worst nuclear accident.In its latest assessment of the fighting, the British Defense Ministry reported Russian advances and heavy fighting in the Donbas region, with one town, Kreminna, reportedly falling after days of street-to-street fighting.Ukraine\'s General Staff said Russian forces shelled Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city that lies outside the Donbas but has seen significant attacks as Moscow seeks full control of the region. Ukrainian forces struck back in the Kherson region in the south.A senior Russian military official has said that Russia\'s goal is full control of Ukraine\'s east and south, which would give it a swath of land that lies between Russia and Crimea, which Moscow seized in 2014.Four people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region of the Donbas, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.The city council and mayor of Mariupol said a new mass grave was identified about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the port city, which is key to the battle of the Donbas. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities were trying to estimate the number of victims. It was at least the third new mass grave discovered in Russian-controlled areas near Mariupol in the last week.Mariupol has been gutted by bombardment and fierce street fighting over the past two months. Russia\'s capture of the city, where an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian troops and some 1,000 civilians are reportedly sheltering in a sprawling steel works, would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, help complete the land corridor to Crimea and free up troops to redeploy elsewhere in the Donbas.Britain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Russia\'s invasion began - far above the 1,351 deaths acknowledged by Moscow. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25 per cent of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine "have been rendered not combat effective."Ukrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April. The West hopes that boosting arms supplies will help remaining fighters repel Russia\'s invasion. As he opened the meeting in Germany, Austin sought to reassure Kyiv: "We know, and you should know, that all of us have your back and that\'s why we\'re here today - to strengthen the arsenal of Ukrainian democracy."', 'image': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-91101322,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-62954,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:40'}

Photograph: Alexei Alexandrov/AP\n\n\n\n47m ago 01.06 Zelenskiy reiterated Russia’s threat to nuclear security in his national address after meeting with director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi. No other country in the world since 1986 has posed such a major threat to nuclear security, to Europe and the world, that Russia has posed since February 24. Russia kept a contingent in the Chernobyl zone with armoured vehicles, which destroyed the soil surface and raised an extraordinary amount of dust into the air, including radioactive particles.” Zelenskiy added that Russia has “no right to turn nuclear energy into weapons”, as well as to blackmail the world with nuclear weapons. We called everyone, we wanted a tough reaction from the world. We warned everyone that there could be a new nuclear catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is like six Chernobyls, and that it could simply destroy Europe.”\n\n\n\n1h ago 00.50 \'The free world has the right to self-defence,\' Zelenskiy says Zelenskiy has said the “free world has the right to self-defence” after predicting that Russia intends to not only seize the territory of Ukraine but to “dismember the entire centre and east of Europe” and “deal a global blow to democracy”. There are almost no people left in the free world who do not understand that Russia’s war against Ukraine is just the beginning. The ultimate goal of Russia’s leadership is not just to seize the territory of Ukraine, but to dismember the entire centre and east of Europe and deal a global blow to democracy. Therefore, the free world has the right to self-defence. And that is why it will help Ukraine even more.”\n\n\n\n1h ago 00.39 Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said “no one in the world can feel safe” after Russia threatened Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and called for “global control” over Russia’s nuclear facilities and nuclear technology. In his national address this evening, Zelenskiy said:\n\nI believe that after all that the Russian military has done in the Chernobyl zone and at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has. If Russia has forgotten what Chernobyl is, it means that global control over Russia’s nuclear facilities and nuclear technology is needed.” Addressing the latest threats to nuclear safety, Zelenskiy said Russia launched three missiles against Ukraine on Tuesday so that they “flew directly over the blocks of our nuclear power plants”. “Over three nuclear power plants at once. Over Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and South-Ukrainian NPPs,” he added. Russian troops that were trying to attack Kyiv through the Chernobyl zone used the restricted area as a military base. They set up positions on land where it is forbidden to even stand. They drove armoured vehicles through areas where radiation-contaminated materials are buried and where the number of radioactive particles is simply horrendous. They destroyed the dosimetric control points. The Chernobyl radiation monitoring system was broken and looted. They looted a nuclear analytical laboratory...”\n\n\n\n2h ago 00.18 US state department spokesman Ned Price responded to Lavrov’s comments, saying they were part of a “pattern of bellicose statements” from Russia, which he branded “irresponsible” and “a clear attempt to distract from its failure in Ukraine.” Loose talk of nuclear weapons, nuclear escalation is especially irresponsible, it is the height of irresponsibility,” Price told reporters on Tuesday. Price said the US was paying close attention “to Russia’s activities, to what it’s doing and what it’s not doing” but added that the US saw no reason to change its own nuclear posture.\n\n\n\n2h ago 00.05 Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said that the danger of nuclear war is “serious” and the core of any agreement to end the conflict in Ukraine would depend largely on the military situation on the ground. Russia, Lavrov said in an interview broadcast on state television, was doing a lot to uphold the principle of striving to prevent nuclear war at all costs. This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable. I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it.” Lavrov, defending Moscow’s actions, also blamed Washington for the lack of dialogue. “The United States has practically ceased all contacts simply because we were obliged to defend Russians in Ukraine,” Lavrov said, repeating the rationale for Moscow’s invasion of its southern neighbour. But he said western supplies of sophisticated weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles and advanced drones were provocative measures calculated to prolong the conflict rather than bring it to an end. “These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov said. “Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” he added. “Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n\n\n2h ago 23.45 The UN General Assembly took a first step to put the five permanent members of the Security Council under a global spotlight on Tuesday when they use their veto power, a move highlighted by Russia’s veto and threat of future vetoes that has paralysed any action by the UN’s most powerful body on the Ukraine war, the Associated Press is reporting. The resolution does not eliminate or limit the veto power of the permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France. But for the first time it will require the General Assembly “to hold a debate on the situation” that sparks a veto in the Security Council within 10 working days, and to give precedence on the list of speakers to the permanent member who cast the veto. The assembly isn’t required to take or consider any action, but the discussion could put veto-wielders on the spot and let a raft of other countries be heard. Liechtenstein’s UN ambassador, Christian Wenaweser, who spearheaded the resolution, has said it aims “to promote the voice of all of us who are not veto-holders, and who are not on the Security Council, on matters of international peace and security because they affect all of us.” Presenting the resolution to the assembly on Tuesday morning, Wenaweser alluded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Security Council’s failure to take action saying: “There has never been a stronger need for effective multilateralism than today, and there has never been a stronger need for innovation in order to secure the central role and voice of the United Nations.”\n\n\n\n3h ago 23.17 Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy believes Russia is trying to destabilise the situation in the Transnistrian region, while Ukrainian armed forces are ready for a possible escalation by Russian troops in the temporarily occupied territory of the Republic of Moldova. Answering journalists’ questions after a meeting with IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said that he fully shares the assessment of the situation by Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Zelenskiy also said that he discussed that issue with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă who was in Kyiv on Tuesday. We clearly understand that this is one of the steps of the Russian Federation. The special services are working there. It’s not just about fake news. The goal is obvious - to destabilise the situation in the region, to threaten Moldova. They show that if Moldova supports Ukraine, there will be certain steps.” According to Zelenskiy, Ukraine knows that the Russian troops, which have been present in the territory of the temporarily occupied part of Moldova - Transnistria for many years, are in “constant readiness”. “But we understand their capabilities, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready for this and are not afraid of them,” he added.\n\nUpdated at 23.21 BST\n\n3h ago 22.54 Britain’s Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss is expected to call on allies of Ukraine to “ramp up” military production including of planes and tanks, the AFP is reporting after reviewing a preview of a speech to be delivered on Wednesday. In her speech, called the new approach, Truss says the UK’s new approach “will be based on three areas: military strength, economic security and deeper global alliances”. “We cannot be complacent - the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance,” her speech reads. Russia’s victory will have “terrible consequences across the globe”, Truss is expected to say. “We must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support for Ukraine. “Heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes – digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this.” “There must be nowhere for Putin to go to fund this appalling war,” her speech continues. “The architecture that was designed to guarantee peace and prosperity has failed Ukraine.” “We must also follow through on the unity shown in this crisis to reboot, recast and remodel our approach to deterring aggressors.” Truss will also call for “free nations” to be “more assertive and self-confident”, according to AFP.\n\nUpdated at 23.00 BST\n\n3h ago 22.31 A senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday that the Department of Defense established a control center in Germany to assist in the distribution of US military aid to Ukraine, CNN is reporting. The control center, called the EUCOM Control Center of Ukraine or ECCU is based within the US European Command area of responsibility in Stuttgart, Germany. It’s run by a two-star military general and works with the international donor coordination center or IDCC.\n\n\n\n4h ago 22.18 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said while the US doesn’t expect to encounter any food shortages as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the administration is working to “bolster food security around the globe” both independently and with allies.

In addition to Poland, Gazprom has announced that it would stop delivering gas to Bulgaria after demanding that countries pay for gas in rubles. Gazprom executives were quoted by Russian news agencies as saying “Poland must pay for gas supplies according to the new payment procedure”. However, it was not immediately clear whether Bulgaria has refused to pay in rubles as well. “Bulgargaz received a notification today, April 26, that natural gas supplies from Gazprom Export will be suspended starting April 27,” Bulgaria’s economy ministry said in a statement. More from AFP: Bulgaria’s energy ministry also said Tuesday that its state-owned gas operators Bulgargaz and Bulgartransgaz “have undertaken steps for alternative agreements for natural gas deliveries and for coping with the current situation”. “At present, there is no need for (imposing) any restrictive measures on consumption,” it added. Bulgaria is almost completely dependent on Russia for its annual consumption of about 3.0 billion cubic metres of gas. The Balkan nation receives only small amounts from Azerbaijan that it hopes to increase after completing a key pipe link to neighbouring Greece later this year.\n\n', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d9a0109116137e08f263d606ebd1967c945be55/0_397_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fa2caefd5eb158723f67cf4182b20b7', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:15'}

"We are here to support you in any way possible."\n\nSaid Blinken: "The reason we\'re back is because of you, because of the extraordinary courage, leadership and success that you\'ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression."\n\nUS officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for Zelensky\'s government and other countries in the region. An extra $322 million in military aid for Ukraine would take total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, one official said.\n\n"It will provide support for capabilities Ukraine needs, especially the fight in the Donbas," the official said. It would also help Ukraine\'s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defence systems -- essentially NATO capable systems, the official added on condition of anonymity.\n\nWestern arms for Ukraine have infuriated Moscow. Russia\'s ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note stressing "the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice".\n\nThe meeting between the US delegation and Ukraine\'s leaders ran for three hours, or more than double the allotted time, a US official said.\n\n"In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded," Blinken told a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine\'s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nJust weeks ago, Kyiv was a frontline city under curfew and bombardment, with tens of thousands of Russian troops massing on its northern outskirts. Residents spent nights huddled in its metro stations, sheltering from artillery.\n\nToday, the nearest Russian troops are hundreds of miles away, normal life is returning to the capital, Western leaders have been visiting and countries are reopening their embassies.\n\nBlinken said US diplomats would first return to Lviv in the west and should be back in Kyiv within weeks.\n\nBut despite Ukraine having repelled the assault on Kyiv, the war is far from over. Russia has regrouped its forces and sent more troops in to eastern Ukraine. Last week it launched a massive assault there in an attempt to capture eastern provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nRAILWAY STATIONS HIT\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying. Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot. There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\'s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nIn a daily update on the conflict, Britain\'s defence ministry said Russia had only made minor advances in some parts of Donbas.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nIn an emotional address at Kyiv\'s 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral to mark the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday, Zelensky said his nation would overcome "dark times".\n\nWAR GRINDS ON\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country, where the war grinds on relentlessly.\n\nSome 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\nRussia also fired rockets at two towns in the central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\nUkraine\'s general staff described Russian shelling and assaults along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steel works in Mariupol where the last Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a city destroyed during two months of Russian siege and bombardment.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation", denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, Britain\'s The Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.', 'image': 'https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/04/25/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg/BINARY/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:55'}

"As we see this morning, nations from around the world stand united in our resolve to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia\'s imperial aggression," Austin said. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here."US Army General Mark Milley , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said ahead of the talks that a key goal was to coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, to help it defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east."The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."Driven back by Ukrainian forces from a failed assault on Kyiv in the north, Moscow has redeployed troops into the east for a ground offensive in two provinces known as the Donbas.US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, assess that Russia will rely heavily on artillery strikes, trying to pound Ukrainian positions as Moscow moves in ground forces from several directions to try to envelop and wipe out a significant chunk of Ukraine\'s military. But the United States also estimates many Russian units are depleted, with some operating with personnel losses as high as 30 per cent, a level considered by the US military to be too high to keep fighting, officials say.US officials cite anecdotes like Russian tanks with sole drivers and no crew and substandard equipment that is either prone to breakdowns or out of date.British assessments showed that about 15,000 Russian personnel had been killed in the conflict while 2,000 armored vehicles including some 530 tanks had been destroyed, along with 60 helicopters and fighter jets, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday. Russia has so far acknowledged only 1,351 troops killed and 3,825 wounded.Russia still has advanced capabilities and superior force numbers, and has shown a willingness to keep pouring soldiers and units into the fight, US officials said. Moscow can also economically afford to wage a long war in Ukraine despite being hammered by Western sanctions, defence experts and economists said.For its part, Ukraine boasts high morale, creative and adaptive battlefield tactics and local knowledge of the terrain, along with arms and intelligence from the United States and its allies. "They definitely stand a fighting chance," a US military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The meeting, which aims to ensure a steady flow of such aid, is taking place at Ramstein, a sprawling air base southwest of Frankfurt which only months ago was grappling with an influx of Afghan evacuees after the Taliban takeover of that country last summer.Organizers said over 40 countries were attending and a scan of the meeting room showed countries from the Middle East and Africa. On a screen, representatives from South Korea and Japan appeared to be attending virtually. "This gathering reflects the galvanized world," Austin said.Germany, for the first time, announced the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine. "We decided yesterday that Germany will facilitate the delivery of Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine," German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said at Ramstein, according to the script of her speech.Russia\'s February 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, by far the world\'s two biggest nuclear powers. Putin says the "special military operation" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Ukraine was guilty of the genocide of Russian-speaking people.

It also condemned the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes and called for anyone detained to be treated humanely in accordance with the requirements of international humanitarian law.\n\nAslin, originally from Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, north England, and Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, east England, are both members of the Ukrainian armed forces. The families said they have both been in Ukraine since 2018, long before the Russian invasion of the eastern European country.\n\nThe pair were captured earlier this month after their unit had to surrender after 48 days of defending Mariupol as they were “running out of ammunition.”\n\nThey later appeared on Russian state TV, asking Johnson to help exchange for them with Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who was arrested by the Ukrainian secret services on April 12. It’s not clear if they were under duress.\n\nBoth appeared to have bruises and Aslin appeared to have been beaten. Their families later said they were in contact with the UK’s Foreign Office to ensure the Russian authorities “meet their obligations to prisoners of war under international law.”\n\nRussia’s foreign ministry on April 21 said “the Russian side [was] taking care of them,” and they were “fed, watered, and given the necessary assistance. Just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained.”\n\nA Russian national flag flies by destroyed buildings in Mariupol, Ukraine, on April 12, 2022.

The International Committee of the Red Cross also recommends not publishing images that identify prisoners of war, or show them in humiliating or degrading situations unless there’s a “compelling public interest” in doing so in accordance with the Geneva Convention.\n\nBut Aslin’s mother Angela and his brother Nathan spoke to TalkTV on Monday, pleading for Johnson’s help. Pinner’s family also previously released a statement through the FCDO, rebuking Russian media’s characterisation of foreign fighters in the Ukrainian military as “mercenaries.”\n\n“I would hope that, at some point, there will be a prisoner swap. However, it’s out of my hands. It is between Ukraine and Russia,” Nathan Aslin told TalkTV.\n\nOutlining his recent phone conversation with his brother, Nathan Aslin told the broadcaster, “It was obvious that he was with the Russian people that were holding him and he was asking for me to contact Boris [Johnson] to get this prison swap done. And to keep on asking for this swap.”\n\nAsked what he would say to the prime minister, Nathan said: “Act now when you got the time to act. You’ve got two British citizens on the line, being forced to say whatever the Russians are putting in [their] mouths at gunpoint, whether they show it on the camera or not. And it’s a moral obligation to do something about it.”\n\nAngela Aslin added: “I would like to hope that Boris will help. And talk to the Ukraine government [and] embassy. There can be something sorted out so that these two guys can come home.”\n\nAslin moved to Ukraine in 2018 with his Ukrainian fiancée and now holds British and Ukrainian citizenship. He previously fought the ISIS terrorist group with Kurdish militia People’s Defense Units in Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nPinner’s family previously said that the former British Army soldier decided to relocate to Ukraine in 2019 “to use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military.”\n\nThe statement said Pinner “enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country” where he also met his Ukrainian wife.\n\nForeign Office minister James Cleverly on Tuesday confirmed that Aslin and Pinner should be treated as prisoners of war.\n\nAsked about the pair by Aslin’s local MP—former housing minister Robert Jenrick—Cleverly told Parliament he had discussed the issue of foreign volunteer fighters with the Ukrainian government.\n\n“They are clear, and we are clear, that those fighting under the Ukrainian flag for the Ukrainian armed forces in the defence of Ukraine should be treated as Ukrainian military and as prisoners of war, with all the protections that the international humanitarian law affords to those individuals,” Cleverly said.\n\nThe UK government advises against all travel to Ukraine.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/1.2.66462486.jpg-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:36'}

The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nWhen asked if the current situation in Ukraine was comparable to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Lavrov said that "back then there were actually only a few rules, written rules."\n\nHowever, Lavrov said that during that time, there were "clear rules of conduct" and a channel of communication between the leaders of the US and Soviet Union that doesn\'t exist today.\n\nThe foreign minister also criticized Ukraine\'s approach to negotiations following Russia\'s invasion of the country on February 24. Lavrov accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of "pretending" to negotiate.\n\nHe told Russian news agencies the content of peace talks would depend on the military situation and added, "Good will has its limits. But if it isn\'t reciprocal, that doesn\'t help the negotiation process."\n\n"We are continuing to engage in negotiations with the team delegated by Zelenskyy, and these contacts will go on," Lavrov said.\n\nUK defense minister promises armored vehicles with missile launchers\n\nUK Defense Minister Ben Wallace said the British government believes Russia has lost approximately 15,000 soldiers since Russian forces invaded Ukraine February 24.

"That has failed."\n\nBlinken said that Russia\'s military was underperforming and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin\'s on the scene," Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees "final success."\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "things are beginning to get back to normal" in Kyiv, but noted that "that\'s in stark contrast to what\'s going on" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas — UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain\'s defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, "Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials.

(AP Photo/Felipe Dana) (Felipe Dana)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine — (AP) — Russia unleashed a string of attacks Monday against rail and fuel installations deep inside Ukraine, far from the front lines of Moscow’s new eastern offensive, as Russia’s top diplomat warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.”\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, moved to rush more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from the Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n“Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared, a day after he and the U.S. secretary of defense made a bold visit to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nBlinken said Washington approved a $165 million sale of ammunition — non-U.S. ammo, mainly if not entirely for Ukraine\'s Soviet-era weapons — and will also provide more than $300 million in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin took his comments further, saying that while the U.S. wants to see Ukraine remain a sovereign, democratic country, it also wants "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nAustin’s comments about weakening Russia appeared to represent a shift in broader U.S. strategic goals. Previously, the U.S. position had been that the goal of American military aid was to help Ukraine win and to defend Ukraine’s NATO neighbors against Russian threats.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said weapons supplied by Western countries “will be a legitimate target," adding that Russian forces had already targeted weapons warehouses in western Ukraine.\n\n“Everyone is reciting incantations that in no case can we allow World War III,” Lavrov said in a wide-ranging interview on Russian television. He accused Ukrainian leaders of provoking Russia by asking NATO to become involved in the conflict.\n\nBy providing weapons, NATO forces are “pouring oil on the fire,” he said, according to a transcript on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website.\n\nRegarding the possibility of a nuclear confrontation, Lavrov said: “I would not want to see these risks artificially inflated now, when the risks are rather significant.”\n\n“The danger is serious," he said. "It is real. It should not be underestimated.”\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv, the capital. But the Ukrainians, with the help of Western weapons, thwarted the push and forced President Vladimir Putin\'s troops to retreat.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is to take the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking industrial region in eastern Ukraine. While both sides say the campaign in the east is underway, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and warplanes striking far behind the front lines in an effort to thwart Ukrainian efforts to marshal supplies for the fight.\n\nFive railroad stations in central and western Ukraine were hit, and one worker was killed, said Oleksandr Kamyshin, head of Ukraine\'s state railway. The bombardment included a missile attack near Lviv, the western city close to the Polish border that has been swelled by Ukrainians fleeing the fighting elsewhere around the country.\n\nUkrainian authorities said at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk, in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. general who was NATO’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said the latest strikes against fuel depots are part of a strategy to deplete key Ukrainian war resources. The strikes against rail targets, on the other hand, are a newer tactic, he said.\n\n“I think they’re doing it for the legitimate reason of trying to interdict the flow of supplies to the front,” he said. “The illegitimate reason is they know people are trying to leave the country, and this is just another intimidation, terrorist tactic to make them not have faith and confidence in traveling on the rails.”\n\nPhillips P. O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nIn Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova that sits along the Ukrainian border, several explosions believed caused by rocket-propelled grenades hit the territory\'s Ministry of State Security. There was no immediate claim of responsibility or reports of injuries. Transnistria is a strip of land with about 470,000 people and about 1,500 Russian troops based there.\n\nMoldova\'s Foreign Ministry said “the aim of today’s incident is to create pretexts for straining the security situation in the Transnistrian region." The U.S. warned previously that Russia may launch “false-flag” attacks against its own side to create a pretext for invading other nations.\n\nLast week, Rustam Minnekayev, a Russian military commander, said the Kremlin wants full control of southern Ukraine, which he said would open the way to Transnistria.\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic southern port city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas. Over the weekend, Russian forces launched new airstrikes on the Azovstal plant to try to dislodge the holdouts.\n\nSome 1,000 civilians were also said to be taking shelter at the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor Monday for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with skepticism by Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nThe city council and mayor of Mariupol said a new mass grave has been identified about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities were trying to estimate the number of victims. It was at least the third new mass grave discovered in Russian-controlled areas near Mariupol in the last week.\n\nMariupol has been gutted by bombardment and fierce street fighting over the past two months. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, the capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said his country\'s goal is to maintain resistance and “make the occupiers’ stay in our land even more intolerable,” while Russia drains its resources.\n\nA top Ukrainian official cast doubt on the prospect of further talks between the two countries. Recent sessions in Istanbul ended without resolution earlier this month.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview that any negotiations other than talks between Zelenskyy and Putin would bring little resolution.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective."\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Yuras Karmanau and Jon Gambrell in Lviv, Ukraine, and AP staff around the world contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\'s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region.

The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing.

Austin said that the US and its allies will "keep moving heaven and Earth" to meet Ukraine\'s security requirements.\n\n"Ukraine needs our help to win today, and they will still need our help when the war is over," Austin said. He added that the US and its allies have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine\'s defense since the start of the war.\n\nThe defense secretary said that Ukraine "has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia\'s unprovoked invasion."\n\nAustin said that Ukraine\'s allies had provided assistance at "record speed," adding that "Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly."\n\nReferring to Russian troop withdrawal from areas around Ukraine\'s capital, Austin said that the war was "entering a new phase" following what he called "Russia\'s defeat at the battle of Kyiv."\n\n"Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man," Austin said, alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens."\n\nWatch video 01:06 Austin: \'We\'re here to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion\'\n\nExplosions hit radio facility in Russia-backed Trans-Dniester\n\nPolice in the breakaway Moldovan region of Trans-Dniester said that two explosions knocked two powerful antennas out of service in a radio facility close to Ukrainian border. The interior ministry of the region said those antennas were re-broadcasting Russian radio.\n\nThe incident occurred in a small town of Maiac about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the regional capital Tiraspol and roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said.\n\nThe explosions come just a day after several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the state security ministry in Tiraspol.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu is convening a meeting of the country\'s Supreme Security Council on Tuesday over incidents that took place in Trans-Dniester.\n\nTrans-Dniester is a narrow strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River, sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova. The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield.

How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes.

Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito.

He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods.

"The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win," he said.

But Johnson insisted that the West did not need to make concessions despite the nuclear threat.\n\n“People say we have to make a concession, we have to worry about what Putin might do because of the risk of his defeat,” Johnson said. “I think he has got a lot of space, he has got a lot of room for manoeuvre.”\n\n10:02pm: Gazprom has informed Bulgaria, Poland of halt to gas supplies from Wednesday\n\nRussia’s Gazprom has informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it will halt gas supplies as of Wednesday, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ministry said that along with state gas companies it has taken steps to find alternative arrangements for the supply of natural gas and to deal with the situation.\n\nIt said for the time being no restrictions in the gas consumption in the Balkan country which meets over 90 percent of its gas needs with Gazprom’s imports, were required.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Polish officials had said Russia is suspending natural gas deliveries to Poland beginning Wednesday morning after that country refused a demand to pay for its supplies in Russian rubles\n\nPoland’s state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Russian gas giant Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop on Wednesday.\n\nPolish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources. She said the country has been effectively independent when it comes to Russian gas for some time.\n\n“There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes,” Moskwa tweeted.\n\n9:39pm IAEA says it has agreed with Ukraine to help repair damage to Chernobyl\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday said he had agreed with Ukraine to help repair the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant after it was occupied by Russian troops.\n\n“It is visible that there is damage and we are assessing that,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told a news conference in Kyiv after visiting the station.\n\nThirty-six years ago, on April 26, 1986, an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction destroyed the reactor in an accident that was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities.\n\nRussian troops took over the site on February 24 of this year, the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, taking Ukrainian soldiers prisoner and detaining civilian staff.\n\nThe occupation lasted until the end of March and raised global fears of nuclear leaks.\n\nRussia’s temporary takeover of the Chernobyl site was “very, very dangerous” and raised radiation levels but they have now returned to “normal”, Grossi said during his visit there earlier on Tuesday.\n\n9:17pm: US warns not to \'escalate tensions\' after Moldova region blasts\n\nThe United States on Tuesday warned against attempts to "escalate tensions" after a series of blasts in a Russian-backed separatist region of Moldova, which borders Ukraine.\n\nWhile stopping short of backing Kyiv\'s contention that Russia was responsible for the incidents in Transnistria, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters: "We do remain concerned about any potential attempts to escalate tensions."\n\n"We reiterate the Moldovan government\'s call for calm in response to these incidents and we fully support Moldova\'s territorial integrity and sovereignty," Price said.\n\nThe mysterious recent blasts which targeted the state security ministry, a radio tower and military unit came days after a senior Russian commander claimed Russian speakers in Moldova were being oppressed.\n\nRussian forces have been positioned in Transnistria for three decades after the predominantly Russian-speaking region seceded from the former Soviet republic, a decision not recognized internationally.\n\n9:04pm: US says talk of Lavrov\'s comments on nuclear escalation is irresponsible\n\nThe US State Department on Tuesday criticized Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s comments about the potential of a nuclear war, saying loose talk about nuclear escalation was the "height of irresponsibility."\n\nLavrov warned the West on Monday not to underestimate the elevated risks of nuclear conflict over Ukraine and said he viewed NATO as being "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia by supplying Kyiv with weaponry.\n\n8:10pm: Putin agrees to United Nations, Red Cross help to evacuate civilians from Azovstal plant, UN says\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin agreed “in principle” to UN and International Committee for the Red Cross involvement in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in Ukraine’s Mariupol, the United Nations said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n“Follow-on discussions will be had with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Russian Defence Ministry,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement after Putin met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Moscow.\n\n7:44pm: Putin tells UN chief he still has \'hope\' for Ukraine talks\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told the visiting UN chief Tuesday that he still had hope for negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject (talks)," Putin told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was visiting Moscow, in televised remarks.\n\nSitting across from Guterres at a long table at the Kremlin, Putin said efforts at talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, speaks to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting in the Kremlin, in Moscow, Russia, on April 26, 2022. © Vladimir Astapkovich, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nPutin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia\'s military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.\n\nGuterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (see 2:02pm, below) for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\n6:45pm: Blinken says Putin not \'serious\' about Ukraine diplomacy\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the Ukraine war, despite a series of international efforts.\n\n“We’ve seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: “Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table.”\n\nBlinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlinken hailed what he saw on the trip and said that the US was speeding up arms deliveries, with the process now often taking only 72 hours after Ukraine sends requests.\n\n6:10pm: Germany confirms plans to send Ukraine tanks, in policy shift\n\nGermany said Tuesday it would send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a clear switch in Berlin’s cautious policy on military backing for Kyiv that was welcomed by the United States.\n\nThe government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the US Ramstein airbase.\n\nThe move comes after heavy criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to Ukraine, despite announcing a “turning point” in German defence policy in response to Russia’s invasion.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the pledge to send “some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems”, the English name for the weapons, was “especially welcome”.\n\n5:19pm: US Defence Secretary says US, allies to meet monthly on arming Ukraine\n\nThe United States and its allies will meet once a month to discuss Ukraine\'s defence needs to battle invading Russian troops, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.\n\n"Today\'s gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine\'s self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\n4:53pm: FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg on the fallout over blasts in Transnistria, Moldova\n\n02:48 © FRANCE 24\n\n4:08pm: Putin, Erdogan discuss humanitarian corridors in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow’s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin statement, the leaders in a phone call talked about “efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors”.\n\nThis came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.\n\nThe Kremlin said Erdogan asked Putin about the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe Russian leader told him that “the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there”.\n\n3:09pm: Nearly 5.3 million flee Ukraine war as refugees, up more than 32,000 since Monday\n\nNearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.\n\nIn total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 32,753 over Monday\'s figure.\n\nWhile the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday (see 11:31am, below) that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.\n\n2:02 pm: Guterres says Russia, UN have \'very different\' views of events in Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had "very frank" discussions with Lavrov. He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol.

Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and REUTERS)\n\n© Studio graphique France Médias Monde\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/e48d305a-c59a-11ec-898c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/20220426-gazprom-m.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:46'}

Germany announced it cleared the way for delivery of Gepard anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine."This gathering reflects the galvanized world," Austin said in his opening remarks. He added that he wanted officials to leave the meeting "with a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine\'s near-term security requirements because we\'re going to keep moving heaven and earth so that we can meet them."After fierce defense by Ukrainian forces thwarted Russia\'s attempt to take Ukraine\'s capital early in the war, Moscow now says its focus is the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking industrial region in eastern Ukraine. That move is already having a devastating effect on civilians trapped in the conflict.In the small city of Toretsk, residents are struggling to survive, collecting rainwater for cleaning and washing up and fervently hoping for an end to the fighting. "It\'s bad. Very bad. Hopeless," said Andriy Cheromushkin. "You feel so helpless that you don\'t know what you should do or shouldn\'t do. Because if you want to do something, you need some money; and there is no money now."With the potentially pivotal battle for the Donbas underway, the US and its Nato allies are scrambling to get artillery and other heavy weaponry to that area in time to make a difference.German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said her government decided on Monday to clear the delivery of Gepard self-propelled armored anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, though she didn\'t give details. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced mounting pressure, including from within his governing coalition, to approve sending heavy weapons such as tanks and other armored vehicles to Ukraine.Austin also noted Tuesday that more than 30 allies and partners have joined the US in sending security assistance to Ukraine and more than $5 billion worth of equipment committed.The meeting in Germany comes after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , speaking on Russian television, warned weapons supplied by Western countries "will be a legitimate target," and accused Nato of "pouring oil on the fire" with its support for Ukraine, according to a transcript on the Russian Foreign Ministry\'s website.Lavrov also warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict "should not be underestimated." Russian President Vladimir Putin has cited Nato\'s expansion and the risk that Kyiv could join the alliance as reasons for his invasion.UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey rejected Lavrov\'s accusations of Nato aggression as "utter nonsense." He said "the reason there is a war in Ukraine right now is because Russia rolled over the borders of a sovereign country and started to invade their territory."Heappey also said Russia was making "unsound" military decisions and giving away tactical advantages because of Putin\'s desire to secure some kind of victory by May 9, when Russia marks its victory in World War II.Amid the talk of arms shipments, diplomatic efforts to seek an end to the fighting also continued. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met Lavrov on Tuesday and called again for a cease-fire. The UN chief is scheduled to meet Putin later.Elsewhere, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi visited the Chernobyl nuclear plant to deliver equipment, conduct radiological assessments and restore safeguards monitoring systems after tanks and troops churned up highly contaminated soil there in the early hours of Russia\'s invasion in February. His visit comes on the anniversary of the disaster at the plant in 1986, the world\'s worst nuclear accident.In its latest assessment of the fighting, the British Defense Ministry reported Russian advances and heavy fighting in the Donbas region, with one town, Kreminna, reportedly falling after days of street-to-street fighting.Ukraine\'s General Staff said Russian forces shelled Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city that lies outside the Donbas but has seen significant attacks as Moscow seeks full control of the region. Ukrainian forces struck back in the Kherson region in the south.A senior Russian military official has said that Russia\'s goal is full control of Ukraine\'s east and south, which would give it a swath of land that lies between Russia and Crimea, which Moscow seized in 2014.Four people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region of the Donbas, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.The city council and mayor of Mariupol said a new mass grave was identified about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the port city, which is key to the battle of the Donbas. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities were trying to estimate the number of victims. It was at least the third new mass grave discovered in Russian-controlled areas near Mariupol in the last week.Mariupol has been gutted by bombardment and fierce street fighting over the past two months. Russia\'s capture of the city, where an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian troops and some 1,000 civilians are reportedly sheltering in a sprawling steel works, would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, help complete the land corridor to Crimea and free up troops to redeploy elsewhere in the Donbas.Britain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Russia\'s invasion began - far above the 1,351 deaths acknowledged by Moscow. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25 per cent of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine "have been rendered not combat effective."Ukrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April. The West hopes that boosting arms supplies will help remaining fighters repel Russia\'s invasion. As he opened the meeting in Germany, Austin sought to reassure Kyiv: "We know, and you should know, that all of us have your back and that\'s why we\'re here today - to strengthen the arsenal of Ukrainian democracy."', 'image': 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-91101322,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-62954,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:40'}

Photograph: Alexei Alexandrov/AP\n\n\n\n47m ago 01.06 Zelenskiy reiterated Russia’s threat to nuclear security in his national address after meeting with director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi. No other country in the world since 1986 has posed such a major threat to nuclear security, to Europe and the world, that Russia has posed since February 24. Russia kept a contingent in the Chernobyl zone with armoured vehicles, which destroyed the soil surface and raised an extraordinary amount of dust into the air, including radioactive particles.” Zelenskiy added that Russia has “no right to turn nuclear energy into weapons”, as well as to blackmail the world with nuclear weapons. We called everyone, we wanted a tough reaction from the world. We warned everyone that there could be a new nuclear catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is like six Chernobyls, and that it could simply destroy Europe.”\n\n\n\n1h ago 00.50 \'The free world has the right to self-defence,\' Zelenskiy says Zelenskiy has said the “free world has the right to self-defence” after predicting that Russia intends to not only seize the territory of Ukraine but to “dismember the entire centre and east of Europe” and “deal a global blow to democracy”. There are almost no people left in the free world who do not understand that Russia’s war against Ukraine is just the beginning. The ultimate goal of Russia’s leadership is not just to seize the territory of Ukraine, but to dismember the entire centre and east of Europe and deal a global blow to democracy. Therefore, the free world has the right to self-defence. And that is why it will help Ukraine even more.”\n\n\n\n1h ago 00.39 Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said “no one in the world can feel safe” after Russia threatened Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and called for “global control” over Russia’s nuclear facilities and nuclear technology. In his national address this evening, Zelenskiy said:\n\nI believe that after all that the Russian military has done in the Chernobyl zone and at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has. If Russia has forgotten what Chernobyl is, it means that global control over Russia’s nuclear facilities and nuclear technology is needed.” Addressing the latest threats to nuclear safety, Zelenskiy said Russia launched three missiles against Ukraine on Tuesday so that they “flew directly over the blocks of our nuclear power plants”. “Over three nuclear power plants at once. Over Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and South-Ukrainian NPPs,” he added. Russian troops that were trying to attack Kyiv through the Chernobyl zone used the restricted area as a military base. They set up positions on land where it is forbidden to even stand. They drove armoured vehicles through areas where radiation-contaminated materials are buried and where the number of radioactive particles is simply horrendous. They destroyed the dosimetric control points. The Chernobyl radiation monitoring system was broken and looted. They looted a nuclear analytical laboratory...”\n\n\n\n2h ago 00.18 US state department spokesman Ned Price responded to Lavrov’s comments, saying they were part of a “pattern of bellicose statements” from Russia, which he branded “irresponsible” and “a clear attempt to distract from its failure in Ukraine.” Loose talk of nuclear weapons, nuclear escalation is especially irresponsible, it is the height of irresponsibility,” Price told reporters on Tuesday. Price said the US was paying close attention “to Russia’s activities, to what it’s doing and what it’s not doing” but added that the US saw no reason to change its own nuclear posture.\n\n\n\n2h ago 00.05 Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said that the danger of nuclear war is “serious” and the core of any agreement to end the conflict in Ukraine would depend largely on the military situation on the ground. Russia, Lavrov said in an interview broadcast on state television, was doing a lot to uphold the principle of striving to prevent nuclear war at all costs. This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable. I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it.” Lavrov, defending Moscow’s actions, also blamed Washington for the lack of dialogue. “The United States has practically ceased all contacts simply because we were obliged to defend Russians in Ukraine,” Lavrov said, repeating the rationale for Moscow’s invasion of its southern neighbour. But he said western supplies of sophisticated weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles and advanced drones were provocative measures calculated to prolong the conflict rather than bring it to an end. “These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov said. “Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” he added. “Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n\n\n2h ago 23.45 The UN General Assembly took a first step to put the five permanent members of the Security Council under a global spotlight on Tuesday when they use their veto power, a move highlighted by Russia’s veto and threat of future vetoes that has paralysed any action by the UN’s most powerful body on the Ukraine war, the Associated Press is reporting. The resolution does not eliminate or limit the veto power of the permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France. But for the first time it will require the General Assembly “to hold a debate on the situation” that sparks a veto in the Security Council within 10 working days, and to give precedence on the list of speakers to the permanent member who cast the veto. The assembly isn’t required to take or consider any action, but the discussion could put veto-wielders on the spot and let a raft of other countries be heard. Liechtenstein’s UN ambassador, Christian Wenaweser, who spearheaded the resolution, has said it aims “to promote the voice of all of us who are not veto-holders, and who are not on the Security Council, on matters of international peace and security because they affect all of us.” Presenting the resolution to the assembly on Tuesday morning, Wenaweser alluded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Security Council’s failure to take action saying: “There has never been a stronger need for effective multilateralism than today, and there has never been a stronger need for innovation in order to secure the central role and voice of the United Nations.”\n\n\n\n3h ago 23.17 Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy believes Russia is trying to destabilise the situation in the Transnistrian region, while Ukrainian armed forces are ready for a possible escalation by Russian troops in the temporarily occupied territory of the Republic of Moldova. Answering journalists’ questions after a meeting with IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said that he fully shares the assessment of the situation by Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Zelenskiy also said that he discussed that issue with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă who was in Kyiv on Tuesday. We clearly understand that this is one of the steps of the Russian Federation. The special services are working there. It’s not just about fake news. The goal is obvious - to destabilise the situation in the region, to threaten Moldova. They show that if Moldova supports Ukraine, there will be certain steps.” According to Zelenskiy, Ukraine knows that the Russian troops, which have been present in the territory of the temporarily occupied part of Moldova - Transnistria for many years, are in “constant readiness”. “But we understand their capabilities, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready for this and are not afraid of them,” he added.\n\nUpdated at 23.21 BST\n\n3h ago 22.54 Britain’s Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss is expected to call on allies of Ukraine to “ramp up” military production including of planes and tanks, the AFP is reporting after reviewing a preview of a speech to be delivered on Wednesday. In her speech, called the new approach, Truss says the UK’s new approach “will be based on three areas: military strength, economic security and deeper global alliances”. “We cannot be complacent - the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance,” her speech reads. Russia’s victory will have “terrible consequences across the globe”, Truss is expected to say. “We must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support for Ukraine. “Heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes – digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this.” “There must be nowhere for Putin to go to fund this appalling war,” her speech continues. “The architecture that was designed to guarantee peace and prosperity has failed Ukraine.” “We must also follow through on the unity shown in this crisis to reboot, recast and remodel our approach to deterring aggressors.” Truss will also call for “free nations” to be “more assertive and self-confident”, according to AFP.\n\nUpdated at 23.00 BST\n\n3h ago 22.31 A senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday that the Department of Defense established a control center in Germany to assist in the distribution of US military aid to Ukraine, CNN is reporting. The control center, called the EUCOM Control Center of Ukraine or ECCU is based within the US European Command area of responsibility in Stuttgart, Germany. It’s run by a two-star military general and works with the international donor coordination center or IDCC.\n\n\n\n4h ago 22.18 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said while the US doesn’t expect to encounter any food shortages as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the administration is working to “bolster food security around the globe” both independently and with allies. "We are not expecting a food shortage here at home, but we are acting to bolster food security around the globe both unilaterally and in conjunction with allies and partners," given shortages due to Russia\'s war on Ukraine, @PressSec says. pic.twitter.com/g3rlBdh23Z — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 26, 2022 On Monday, US Deputy Ambassador Richard M Mills told the UN security council that the war in Ukraine may cause food shortages in Palestine. “Due to President Putin’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, food insecurity could worsen even further in the coming weeks, both in Gaza and the West Bank as prices of food, fuel and other commodities rise,” Mills told the UNSC. “We encourage all member states to provide concrete assistance, including financial contributions to UNRWA, to help meet the needs of vulnerable Palestinians,” he continued.\n\nUpdated at 22.51 BST\n\n4h ago 21.56 Russia’s gas company Gazprom is also halting gas deliveries to Bulgaria, AFP reported. In addition to Poland, Gazprom has announced that it would stop delivering gas to Bulgaria after demanding that countries pay for gas in rubles. Gazprom executives were quoted by Russian news agencies as saying “Poland must pay for gas supplies according to the new payment procedure”. However, it was not immediately clear whether Bulgaria has refused to pay in rubles as well. “Bulgargaz received a notification today, April 26, that natural gas supplies from Gazprom Export will be suspended starting April 27,” Bulgaria’s economy ministry said in a statement. More from AFP: Bulgaria’s energy ministry also said Tuesday that its state-owned gas operators Bulgargaz and Bulgartransgaz “have undertaken steps for alternative agreements for natural gas deliveries and for coping with the current situation”. “At present, there is no need for (imposing) any restrictive measures on consumption,” it added. Bulgaria is almost completely dependent on Russia for its annual consumption of about 3.0 billion cubic metres of gas. The Balkan nation receives only small amounts from Azerbaijan that it hopes to increase after completing a key pipe link to neighbouring Greece later this year.\n\n', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d9a0109116137e08f263d606ebd1967c945be55/0_397_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fa2caefd5eb158723f67cf4182b20b7', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:15'}

An extra $322 million in military aid for Ukraine would take total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, one official said.\n\n"It will provide support for capabilities Ukraine needs, especially the fight in the Donbas," the official said. It would also help Ukraine\'s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defence systems -- essentially NATO capable systems, the official added on condition of anonymity.\n\nWestern arms for Ukraine have infuriated Moscow.

Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nJust weeks ago, Kyiv was a frontline city under curfew and bombardment, with tens of thousands of Russian troops massing on its northern outskirts.

Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot. There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems.

"As we see this morning, nations from around the world stand united in our resolve to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia\'s imperial aggression," Austin said. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here."US Army General Mark Milley , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said ahead of the talks that a key goal was to coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, to help it defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east."The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."Driven back by Ukrainian forces from a failed assault on Kyiv in the north, Moscow has redeployed troops into the east for a ground offensive in two provinces known as the Donbas.US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, assess that Russia will rely heavily on artillery strikes, trying to pound Ukrainian positions as Moscow moves in ground forces from several directions to try to envelop and wipe out a significant chunk of Ukraine\'s military. But the United States also estimates many Russian units are depleted, with some operating with personnel losses as high as 30 per cent, a level considered by the US military to be too high to keep fighting, officials say.US officials cite anecdotes like Russian tanks with sole drivers and no crew and substandard equipment that is either prone to breakdowns or out of date.British assessments showed that about 15,000 Russian personnel had been killed in the conflict while 2,000 armored vehicles including some 530 tanks had been destroyed, along with 60 helicopters and fighter jets, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday. Russia has so far acknowledged only 1,351 troops killed and 3,825 wounded.Russia still has advanced capabilities and superior force numbers, and has shown a willingness to keep pouring soldiers and units into the fight, US officials said. Moscow can also economically afford to wage a long war in Ukraine despite being hammered by Western sanctions, defence experts and economists said.For its part, Ukraine boasts high morale, creative and adaptive battlefield tactics and local knowledge of the terrain, along with arms and intelligence from the United States and its allies. "They definitely stand a fighting chance," a US military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The meeting, which aims to ensure a steady flow of such aid, is taking place at Ramstein, a sprawling air base southwest of Frankfurt which only months ago was grappling with an influx of Afghan evacuees after the Taliban takeover of that country last summer.Organizers said over 40 countries were attending and a scan of the meeting room showed countries from the Middle East and Africa. On a screen, representatives from South Korea and Japan appeared to be attending virtually. "This gathering reflects the galvanized world," Austin said.Germany, for the first time, announced the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine. "We decided yesterday that Germany will facilitate the delivery of Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine," German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said at Ramstein, according to the script of her speech.Russia\'s February 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, by far the world\'s two biggest nuclear powers.

The WHO is investigating the origin of the outbreak and acknowledges that “it is not yet clear whether there has been an increase in hepatitis cases or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected.”\n\nThe WHO has admitted that one of the hypotheses focuses on the origin being due to an adenovirus (which has been detected in at least 74 cases). But the statement adds that “while adenovirus is currently one hypothesis as the underlying cause, it does not fully explain the severity of the clinical picture.” Adenoviruses are very common pathogens that almost always cause mild or very mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nThe United Kingdom was the first country to notify the increase in cases of hepatitis of unknown origin on April 15 and health authorities there have already reported 114 patients.

Many cases reported gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting that preceded severe acute hepatitis and elevated liver enzyme levels. “Most of the cases did not have a fever,” explains the WHO. The origin is unknown because “the common viruses that cause acute viral hepatitis” have not been detected in any of the cases.\n\nAll eyes are turning to adenovirus because the UK, where most cases have been reported so far, has recently seen a significant increase in adenovirus infections in children. The health authorities of the Netherlands have reported something similar, says the WHO. But this agency does not rule out that this increase in the detection of adenoviruses may be due to an improvement in laboratory tests to detect this infection.\n\nThe first investigations pointed to the possibility of this being a side effect of Covid – the coronavirus was identified in several hepatitis cases.

These are children between one month and 16 years old; in 17 cases (approximately 10% of the total) a liver transplantation was required, and there was one reported death. The WHO is investigating the origin of the outbreak and acknowledges that “it is not yet clear whether there has been an increase in hepatitis cases or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected.”\n\nThe WHO has admitted that one of the hypotheses focuses on the origin being due to an adenovirus (which has been detected in at least 74 cases). But the statement adds that “while adenovirus is currently one hypothesis as the underlying cause, it does not fully explain the severity of the clinical picture.” Adenoviruses are very common pathogens that almost always cause mild or very mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nThe United Kingdom was the first country to notify the increase in cases of hepatitis of unknown origin on April 15 and health authorities there have already reported 114 patients. The second country that accumulates the most cases so far, according to information released on Saturday by the WHO, is Spain with 13, followed by Israel (12), the United States (9), Denmark (6) and Ireland (5).\n\nIn identified cases it is an acute hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) with markedly elevated liver enzymes, explains the WHO. Many cases reported gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting that preceded severe acute hepatitis and elevated liver enzyme levels. “Most of the cases did not have a fever,” explains the WHO. The origin is unknown because “the common viruses that cause acute viral hepatitis” have not been detected in any of the cases.\n\nAll eyes are turning to adenovirus because the UK, where most cases have been reported so far, has recently seen a significant increase in adenovirus infections in children. The health authorities of the Netherlands have reported something similar, says the WHO. But this agency does not rule out that this increase in the detection of adenoviruses may be due to an improvement in laboratory tests to detect this infection.\n\nThe first investigations pointed to the possibility of this being a side effect of Covid – the coronavirus was identified in several hepatitis cases. An adenovirus, an infection of toxic origin or an entirely unknown virus were not ruled out either.', 'image': 'https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/NMZzsw-OzPN2YjcOQGuYJmlImOc=/1200x0/filters:focal(2228x441:2238x451)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/PFAESI4VNKVEXWUDVDOYXSKXCA.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:49'}

But the minimum grades would have affected just 7% of white British undergraduates.\n\nThe IFS said the impact would be reduced if the requirement was for school-leavers to have at least two Es at A-level or equivalents.

France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nTalking to reporters on April 25, Johnson said it is “very important” to have a French president “who can be relied upon” on international issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s not right for friendly governments to comment on elections in neighbouring countries but what I can certainly say is that it is very, very important that Emmanuel and I have been able to work closely together on Ukraine over the last few weeks and months,” he said.\n\n“We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of NATO, has been absolutely vital for the stance we’ve taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I’m very, very reassured by that.”\n\nFrench President and La Republique en Marche party candidate for reelection Emmanuel Macron celebrates after his victory in France’s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

The French government has complained about the UK’s reluctance to issue fishing licences to French fishermen, claiming it was a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly expressed frustration over France’s alleged failure to prevent illegal immigrants from boarding small boats and crossing the English Channel into Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson, who led the Brexit campaign and took the UK out of the EU, has more common ground with Le Pen than Macron on the issue of EU membership.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, though she insisted during the election campaign she had no “secret agenda” this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nMarine Le Pen, presidential candidate, delivers her concession speech after early result projections show France’s incumbent President Emmanuel Macron heading to win a second five-year term as president, in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

Mr Billinge’s coffin was taken through his hometown of St Austell in Cornwall before a church service in Charlestown, where hundreds turned out to pay their respects.\n\nMr Billinge was 96 when he died on 5 April after a brief illness. The former Royal Engineer was just 18 years old when he landed on the beach in Normandy in 1944. He was one of only four from his unit to survive. He later fought in Caen and the Falaise pocket in Normandy. Mr Billinge went on to raise tens of thousands of pounds for military charities in his late life. One of his daughters, Margot Billinge said on behalf of the family: “Harry was a very loving husband who always looked after mum. “He was steadfast in his love for her. “As a dad, he taught us great values: honesty, kindness, generosity and not to judge.”\n\nWar veteran Harry Billinge died earlier this month at 96 years old.\n\nMr Billinge’s coffin was taken through his hometown of St Austell in Cornwall.\n\nMs Billinge added: “Harry wanted future generations to never forget his comrades who fell in Normandy. “If members of the public would like to pay their respects to Harry, we ask that they become guardians of the British Normandy Memorial.” The army veteran spent over 60 years collecting for the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Appeal. He also helped raise more than £50,000 for the British Normandy Memorial and would make annual journeys to cemeteries of northern France. Mr Billinge was appointed an MBE in 2020 for his fundraising work. He dedicated the honour to the 22,442 service personnel killed on D-Day and during the Battle for Normandy. Speaking to the BBC in 2019, Mr Billinge said: “I'm no hero, I was lucky, I'm here.

Managing businesses like these are [sic] enormously complex and complicated... it’s certainly not a job I or many other people can do.\n\n“That doesn’t mean senior managers and leaders are always right... far from it, but equally we should be fair and recognise that all businesses – public and private – compete for managers who have these skill and pay accordingly. It\'s a lesson to those of us who should have probably worked harder at school.”\n\nMs Hughes added that “the alternative” to such pay inequality “is socialism where you don’t have pay differences like this”, noting: “Sadly again, there\'s not much evidence of successful, fair and open socialist countries in the world who’ve managed to do this either.”\n\nThe exchange took place on Yammer, an internal social media platform for Network Rail employees, during a discussion about planned cuts – and screenshots of the post have been circulating widely among workers balloting for a strike.\n\nThe vote has been prompted by the organisation’s plans to cut 2,500 safety-critical maintenance jobs as part of a £2bn reduction in spending. Workers on rail operators, which are separate from infrastructure manager Network Rail, are also being balloted in light of pay freezes amid soaring inflation and changes to their terms and conditions. Voting opened on Tuesday.\n\nIn a follow-up post after receiving angry replies, the director, who oversees communications in the Wales and western region, apologised, telling colleagues she was “so so sorry” to have “caused such offence”, that she had intended her comments to refer to herself, and that she could “see this was a bad choice of words and not relevant to everyone”.\n\nThe National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) general secretary Mick Lynch told The Independent: “The comments are a desperate and futile attempt by Network Rail to dissuade our railway members from voting in this upcoming strike ballot.\n\n“Network Rail are trying to avoid the elephant in the room, which is that along with the government, they need to refinance the debt they have with bondholders, not try and cut jobs, conditions and compromise railway safety.\n\n“The removal of 2,500 maintenance roles will have a devastating impact on our members livelihoods and will lead to stronger likelihood of serious accidents on the Network.\n\n“RMT is always open for genuine negotiations with Network Rail and the train operating companies. But our members will not be emotionally blackmailed into accepting proposals that will do permanent damage to the long-term future of the railways in this country.”\n\nManuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) rail union, described the post as “foolish” and said it “shows how desperately out of touch the company’s fat cats really are:.\n\nHe added: “It’s insulting to suggest that workers ‘should’ve worked harder in school’, rather than acknowledging the very real cost of living problems people suffer when their pay fails to keep up with inflation. These comments sound even more ludicrous when you consider that most of our members are skilled professional staff with many having been university educated.”\n\nUK news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 23 April 2022 Killy Cavendish during St George\'s Day celebrations in London\'s Trafalgar Square PA UK news in pictures 22 April 2022 A demonstrator holds a pink smoke flare billowing over members of Extinction Rebellion staging a protest against the use of and investment in fossil fuel, outside offices of Vanguard Asset Management on Earth Day in the City of London Reuters UK news in pictures 21 April 2022 The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), the City of London\'s Reserve Army Regiment, fire a 62 Gun Royal Salute at the Tower of London to mark the 96th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II PA UK news in pictures 20 April 2022 Stella Morris the wife of Julian Assange talks to the media outside Westminster Magistrates\' Court in London, after Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was formally issued with an order for extradition to the US to face espionage charges PA UK news in pictures 19 April 2022 Sunrise behind the Bass Rock off the East Lothian coast near North Berwick PA UK news in pictures 18 April 2022 Riders dressed as knights take part in the International Jousting Tournament, held at the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds, northern England AFP/Getty UK news in pictures 17 April 2022 Cyclists take part in MacAvalanche, a mass start mountain bike race through the snow, descending over 900m from the summit of Aonach Mor in the Nevis Range near Fort William PA UK news in pictures 16 April 2022 Zara Tindall riding Classicals Euro Star takes part in the Barefoot Retreats Burnham Market International Horse Trials in Norfolk PA UK news in pictures 15 April 2022 People on the beach in Bournemouth.

The author was referring to her own experiences, not directing the comments at others. She later clarified this on the same thread and this was well received by colleagues.”\n\nOn the RMT ballot, Tim Shoveller, Network Rail’s regional director, said: “Our railway has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and even as passenger numbers start to recover, we know travel habits and passenger demand have changed and the industry has to change too. We cannot keep relying on government handouts, and so we must work together with train operators and our trades unions to save millions of pounds and deliver a more efficient railway.\n\n“Our modernisation programme aims to build a sustainable future that delivers for passengers and creates better and safer jobs for our people. We would not consider any changes that would make the railway less safe. We are disappointed that the RMT has taken this decision and urge them again to work with us, not against us, as we build an affordable railway fit for the future.”', 'image': 'https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/04/26/11/iStock-458131533.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:27'}

            "text": "Russian forces in Ukraine tried to storm a steel plant housing soldiers and civilians in the southern city of Mariupol on Saturday in an attempt to crush the last corner of resistance in a place of deep symbolic and strategic value to Moscow, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nThe reported assault on the eve of Orthodox Easter came after the Kremlin claimed its military had seized all of the shattered city except for the Azovstal plant, and as Russian forces pounded other cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nA 3-month-old baby was among six people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, officials said.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said he would meet Sunday in Kyiv with the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin. He announced the visit at in a news conference and did not immediately share more detail. The White House declined comment.\n\nZelenskyy also bemoaned the death of the infant in Odesa. \u201cThe war started when this baby was one month old. Can you imagine what is happening?\u201d he said. \u201cThey are just bastards. \u2026 I don\u2019t have any other words for it, just bastards.\u201d\n\nSee: The next stage of war is unfolding, and it includes cyber attacks on power grids and oil refineries\n\nThe fate of the Ukrainians in the sprawling seaside steel mill in Mariupol wasn\u2019t immediately clear; earlier Saturday, a Ukrainian military unit released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun.\n\n\u201cWe want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,\u201d one woman in the video said. \u201cYou have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness.\u201d\n\nAs the battle for the port ground on, Russia claimed it had taken control of several villages elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region and destroyed 11 Ukrainian military targets overnight, including three artillery warehouses. Russian attacks also struck populated areas.\n\nAssociated Press journalists observed shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city; regional Gov. Oleh Sinehubov said three people were killed. In the Luhansk area of the Donbas, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six people died during the shelling of a village, Gorskoi.\n\nIn Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas, AP witnessed two soldiers arriving at a hospital, one of them mortally wounded. Nearby a small group of people gathered outside a church where a priest blessed them with water on Holy Saturday.\n\nWhile British officials said Russian forces had not gained significant new ground, Ukrainian officials announced a nationwide curfew ahead of Easter Sunday, a sign of the war\u2019s disruption and threat to the entire country.\n\nSee also: Loss of fertilizer supplies from Russia feeds food inflation, benefits other producers\n\nMariupol has been a key Russian objective since the invasion began Feb. 24 and has taken on outsize importance in the war. Completing its capture would give Russia its biggest victory yet, after a nearly two-month siege reduced much of the city to a smoking ruin.\n\nIt would deprive the Ukrainians of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere and establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014. Russia-backed separatists control parts of the Donbas.\n\nAn advisor to Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, Oleksiy Arestovich, said during a Saturday briefing that Russian forces resumed air strikes on the Azovstal plant and were trying to storm it. A direct attempt to take the plant would represent a reversal from an order Russian President Vladimir Putin gave two days earlier.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin on Thursday that the whole of Mariupol, with the exception of Azovstal, had been \u201cliberated.\u201d At the time, Putin ordered him not to send troops into the plant but instead to block it off, an apparent attempt to starve out those inside and force their surrender.\n\nUkrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops are inside the plant along with civilians sheltering in its underground tunnels. Arestovic said they were trying to counter the new attacks.\n\nEarlier Saturday the Azov Regiment of Ukraine\u2019s National Guard, which has members holed up in the plant, released the video of around two dozen women and children. Its contents could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians trapped underground there.\n\nThe video shows soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl says she and her relatives \u201chaven\u2019t seen neither the sky nor the sun\u201d since they left home Feb. 27.\n\nThe regiment\u2019s deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told AP the video was shot Thursday. The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed in 2014 by far-right activists at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and elicited criticism for some of its tactics.\n\nMore than 100,000 people \u2014 down from a prewar population of about 430,000 \u2014 are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat, according to Ukrainian authorities, who estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city during the Russian blockade.\n\nSatellite images released this week showed what appeared to be a second mass grave near Mariupol, and local officials accused Russia of burying thousands of civilians to conceal the slaughter taking place there. The Kremlin has not commented on the satellite images.\n\nUkrainian officials had said they would try again Saturday to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol, but like previous plans to get civilians out of the city, it failed. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol\u2019s mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organized buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 227 kilometers (141 miles) to the northwest.\n\n\u201cAt 11 o\u2019clock, at least 200 Mariupol residents gathered near the Port City shopping center, waiting for evacuation,\u201d Andryushchenko posted on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cThe Russian military drove up to the Mariupol residents and ordered them to disperse, because now there will be shelling.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said, Russian buses assembled about 200 meters away. Residents who got on board were told they were being taken to separatist-occupied territory and not allowed to disembark, Andryushchenko said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nIn the attack on Odesa, Russian troops fired at least six missiles, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister. Defense forces repelled some of the rockets, but at least one hit, he said.\n\n\u201cResidents of the city heard explosions in different areas,\u201d Gerashchenko said via Telegram post. \u201cResidential buildings were hit. It is already known about one victim. He burned in his car in a courtyard of one of the buildings.\u201d\n\nThe presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, later reported that the 3-month-old baby was among the five dead.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Zelenskyy lamented all the war\u2019s casualties, noting that the Easter holiday commemorates Christ\u2019s resurrection after his death by crucifixion.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the victory of life over death,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how fierce the battles are, there is no chance for death to defeat life. Everyone knows that. Every Christian knows that.\u201d",

The video could not be independently verified.\n\nIn the video, members of the Azov Regiment are shown descending a flight of stairs \u2014 past graffiti on the walls in large letters in Russian saying \u201cchildren\u201d \u2014 to deliver food to civilians in an underground basement with a steel door.\n\nA large group of women and children gathers to receive the delivery. None are identified. The shelter appears to be home to a few dozen people, tightly crowded and with their belongings suspended on lines above their beds to maximize the use of the space.\n\nSome civilians say they want to be evacuated to Ukrainian-controlled territory and demand a halt to all fighting. They also say they are running out of food. Some say they have been there since the end of February or the beginning of March, having moved to the plant because it seemed at that time to be a refuge from the shelling.\n\nOne girl says she and other children have been playing a game on their phone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d keep playing on the phone, but we want to go home,\" another girl adds. \"We want to see the sun.\u201d\n\nA woman says she needs a guarantee that her children will be safe if they try to leave.\n\n\u201cPlease, get us out of here,\" she says. \"We want to see a peaceful sky, we want to breathe fresh air.

            "text": "By DAVID KEYTON\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 The U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the country\u2019s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, which was confirmed by a senior Ukrainian official, came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia\u2019s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow\u2019s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n\u201cYes, they\u2019re meeting with the president. Let\u2019s hope something will be decided on further help,\u201d Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told Russian lawyer and activist Mark Feygin on his YouTube show \u201cFeygin Live.\u201d The United States has not yet commented.\n\nBefore the session with Blinken and Austin, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,\u201d he said.\n\nZelenskyy\u2019s last face-to-face meeting with a top U.S. official was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris, five days before Russia\u2019s invasion. While the West has funneled military equipment to Ukraine, Zelenskyy has stressed repeatedly that his country needs more heavy weapons, including long-range air defense systems and warplanes.\n\nIn an apparent boost for Ukraine, polling agencies said French President Emmanuel Macron would win reelection over far right candidate Marine Le Pen, who has faced questions about her ties to Moscow. The result was hailed by France\u2019s allies in the European Union as a reassuring sign of stability and continued support for Ukraine. France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons systems to Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy\u2019s meeting with U.S. officials took place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter. Speaking from Kyiv\u2019s ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted its significance to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\n\n\u201cThe great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the war cast a shadow over celebrations. In the northern village of Ivanivka, where Russian tanks still littered the roads, Olena Koptyl said \u201cthe Easter holiday doesn\u2019t bring any joy. I\u2019m crying a lot. We cannot forget how we lived.\u201d\n\nThe Russian military reported hitting 423 Ukrainian targets overnight, including fortified positions and troop concentrations, while its warplanes destroyed 26 Ukrainian military sites, including an explosives factory and several artillery depots.\n\nSince failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians have aimed to gain full control over the eastern industrial heartland, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war.\n\nRussian forces launched fresh airstrikes on a Mariupol steel plant where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. The Azovstal steel mill where the defenders are holed up is the last corner of resistance in the city, otherwise occupied by the Russians.\n\nZelenskyy said he stressed the need to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, including from the steel plant, in a Sunday call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is scheduled to speak later with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nArestovych, the Zelenskyy adviser, said Ukraine has proposed holding talks with Russia next to the sprawling steel mill. Arestovych said on the Telegram messaging app that Russia has not responded to the proposal that would include establishing humanitarian corridors and the exchange of Russian war prisoners for the fighters still in the plant.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is scheduled to travel to Turkey on Monday and then Moscow and Kyiv. Zelenskyy said it was a mistake for Guterres to visit Russia before Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhy? To hand over signals from Russia? What should we look for?\u201d Zelenskyy said Saturday. \u201cThere are no corpses scattered on the Kutuzovsky Prospect,\u201d he said, referring to one of Moscow\u2019s main avenues.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nMore than 100,000 people \u2014 down from a prewar population of about 430,000 \u2014 are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate over 20,000 civilians have been killed. Recent satellite images showed what appeared to be mass graves to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nChildren in an underground bunker were seen receiving Easter presents in a video released Sunday by the far-right Azov Battalion, which is among the Ukrainian forces at the steel plant in Mariupol. The group\u2019s deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, said the video was shot at the plant.\n\nOne toddler is seen wearing homemade diapers made of cellophane and people are seen hanging laundry on makeshift hangers.\n\n\u201cPlease help us,\u201d one woman in the video said through tears, appealing to world leaders. \u201cWe want to live in our city, in our country. We are tired of these bombings, constant air strikes on our land. How much longer will this continue?\u201d\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, another presidential adviser, tweeted that the Russian military was attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery while accumulating forces and equipment for a direct assault.\n\nZelenskyy on Saturday accused Russians of committing war crimes by killing civilians and of setting up \u201cfiltration camps\u201d near Mariupol for people trying to leave the city. He said the Ukrainians \u2014 many of them children \u2014 are then sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East.\n\nThe claims could not be independently verified. But they were repeated by Ukrainian lawmaker Yevheniya Kravchuk on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have pulled these people from Mariupol \u2014 they are put to filtration camps \u2026 it\u2019s sort of something that can\u2019t be happening in the 21st century,\u201d Kravchuk said.\n\nZelenskyy also claimed that intercepted communications recorded Russian troops discussing \u201chow they conceal the traces of their crimes\u201d in Mariupol.\n\nAnd he highlighted the death of a 3-month old girl in a Russian missile strike Saturday on the Black Sea port of Odesa. The baby was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at Odesa, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nUkrainian news agency UNIAN, citing social media, reported that the infant\u2019s mother, Valeria Glodan, and grandmother also died when a missile hit a residential area. Zelenskyy promised to find and punish those responsible.\n\n\u201cThe war started when this baby was 1 month old,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cCan you imagine what is happening? They are filthy scum; there are no other words for it.\u201d\n\nFor the Donbas offensive, Russia has reassembled troops who fought around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine. The British Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week and \u201cinflicted significant cost on Russian forces.\u201d\n\nThe spiritual leaders of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians and Roman Catholics appealed for relief for Ukraine\u2019s suffering population.\n\nFrom Istanbul, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I said a \u201chuman tragedy\u201d was unfolding. Bartholomew, considered the first among his Eastern Orthodox patriarch equals, cited in particular \u201cthe thousands of people surrounded in Mariupol, civilians, among them the wounded, the elderly, women and many children.\u201d\n\nPope Francis, speaking from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square, renewed his call for an Easter truce, calling it \u201ca minimal and tangible sign of a desire for peace.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Yesica Fisch in Sloviansk, Ukraine, Mstyslav Chernov and Felipe Dana in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Yuras Karmanau in Lviv, Cara Anna, Inna Varenytsia and Oleksandr Stashevskyi in Kviv and AP staff around the world contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

He was already scheduled to go to Moscow to see Putin and Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. On the trip, Guterres and staff members plan to discuss stepping up humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians affected by the war, the UN said.\n\nRussia Says 1 Dead, 27 Missing in Moskva Sinking (10:37 p.m.)\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry said one sailor died and 27 people remain missing after last week\u2019s sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet. Russia says the ship sank in a storm while it was being towed back to port after fires broke out on board.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military says the ship, whose normal crew was thought to be close to 500, sunk after being hit by Neptune missiles. The U.S. has backed Ukraine\u2019s account.\n\nCo-Heads of Russia\u2019s Biggest Digital Lender Quit (8:58 p.m.)\n\nThe co-heads of Russia\u2019s biggest digital lender quit to start a fintech focused on emerging markets in Southeast Asia days after the bank\u2019s founder, sanctioned billionaire Oleg Tinkov, slammed Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as an \u201cinsane war.\u201d\n\nOliver Hughes and Pavel Fedorov, the former co-chief executive officers of TCS Group Holding Plc, are currently fundraising with venture capital firms and sovereign wealth funds, with the aim of closing the round by June, Fedorov said from Abu Dhabi.\n\nBritain Weighs Sending Tanks to Poland (8:35 p.m.)\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s ministry of defense said it is \u201cexploring sending British Challenger 2 tanks\u201d to Poland, to help \u201cbridge the gap between Poland donating tanks to Ukraine and replacements arriving.\u201d\n\nUN\u2019s Guterres Will See Putin, Lavrov Next Week (6:43 p.m.)\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will \u201cbe received by\u201d Putin in Moscow on April 26 and will have a working lunch with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, according to statements from the UN and the Kremlin.\n\nGuterres earlier this week asked for separate meetings with Putin and Zelenskiy to discuss \u201curgent steps\u201d for peace.\n\nEU Chief Sought to Confront Putin With Truths, Official Says (5:55 p.m.)\n\nThe president of the European Council, Charles Michel, told Russian President Putin what an EU official called some brutal truths about the war in Ukraine during a call Friday. Michel, who chairs EU summits, believes Putin\u2019s entourage doesn\u2019t brief him fully about events, according to the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss confidential talks.\n\nMichel told Putin that the Russian leader had been wrong about his expectations that the war would last 48 hours, divide EU members and fail to trigger heavy economic sanctions. According to the Kremlin\u2019s readout, Putin reiterated Moscow\u2019s public line, criticizing what it called \u201cirresponsible statements of EU officials on the need to resolve the situation in Ukraine militarily\u201d and the bloc\u2019s \u201cignoring of numerous war crimes by Ukrainian forces.\u201d\n\nEstonia Wards Off Cyber-Attacks With Links to Russian Hackers (5:23 p.m.)\n\nEstonia has fended off a wave of cyber-attacks believed to be launched by a pro-Kremlin hacker group targeting Ukraine supporters. Around 700 million denial-of-service attacks mainly from outside of Europe were launched against the websites of the Estonian president, foreign ministry, police and public services agencies on Thursday and Friday, the Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team said.\n\nThe impact has so far been minimal, the authority said. The website of a NATO cybersecurity center in Estonia, which this week hosted a global exercise with 2,000 participants from 32 countries, was among the websites that were temporarily down. The pro-Kremlin hacker group Killnet has claimed to be behind the attacks, a military spokeswoman said on Friday.\n\nHalliburton Says It Must End Some Deals in Russia by May 15 (5:13 p.m.)\n\nHalliburton Co. said that sanctions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other nations require the company to wind down certain contracts in Russia by May 15.\n\nThe company also said that the total net book value of its assets in Russia is about $340 million, and warned the invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions could cause the company to take a charge related to those assets.\n\nEU Suggests Companies Should Keep Paying for Russia Gas in Euros (5:03 p.m.)\n\nThe European Union has suggested that companies could keep paying for gas in euros, as it published guidance that Moscow\u2019s decree calling for payment in rubles would violate sanctions.\n\nThe commission confirmed a preliminary assessment that the decree would run against European sanctions imposed on Russia. It also said the decree doesn\u2019t automatically preclude allowing companies to continue paying in euros, and the scope for exemptions is not yet clear. The commission advised companies to seek confirmation from Moscow that this was possible.\n\nU.S. Leaves World Bank-IMF Meeting in Protest as Russia Speaks (4:46 p.m.)\n\nOfficials representing the U.S., Germany, Japan, and other nations walked out of a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund gathering on Friday when Russia\u2019s envoy started speaking, the second such action at a high-profile gathering in Washington this week, people familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe representatives were attending a meeting of the institution\u2019s development committee, according to the people, who declined to be identified because the gathering is private. The committee is a ministerial-level forum of the World Bank and the IMF for intergovernmental consensus-building on development issues and has 25 members, usually ministers of finance or development, according to its website.\n\nRussia Faces \u2018Reverse Industrialization\u2019 Amid Sanctions (2:11 p.m.)\n\nRussia faces a deep and prolonged economic contraction along with higher inflation and reduced living standards, as sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies sap it of vital products and technology, according to economists at the central bank.\n\nIn its most detailed public statement on the outlook since the war started, the Bank of Russia warned that \u201cthe depth of the contraction may be quite significant and exit trajectory drawn out in time\u201d because the supply shocks triggered by sanctions are unlikely to fade quickly. It said Russia would experience \u201creverse industrialization\u201d as sanctions forced it to seek lower-tech replacements for western goods that were cut off.\n\nGeneral Says Kremlin Seeks Full Control of Southern Ukraine (11:04 a.m.)\n\nA top general said the Kremlin aims to secure control of the entire south of Ukraine as well as the eastern Donbas region, Russia\u2019s state-run Tass and RIA Novosti reported.\n\nMajor General Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Central Military District, spoke in Ekaterinburg. It\u2019s unclear whether his statements reflect official Kremlin objectives.\n\nRussia wants to create a land bridge to Crimea as well to influence key aspects of Ukraine\u2019s economy, including major Black Sea ports, he said. Ultimately the Kremlin wants access to Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria, which lies to the northwest of Odesa.\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

Children are dying. The Russians now hate my country.\u201d\n\nA few Russians interviewed said they did not support the war and felt sick or guilty about it. But to avoid any confrontation in the pews, they stuck to small talk with Ukrainians about the festivities and warming weather, they said.\n\nOrdinary Russians say Dubai has become an increasingly rare haven as anti-Russian hostility escalates around the world over the grinding war, which has rocked the stability of Europe, sent oil prices soaring and triggered the continent\u2019s worst refugee crisis since World War II.\n\n\u2014-\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he has discussed the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol in a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nZelenskyy said on Twitter that he \u201cstressed the need for immediate evacuation of civilians from Mariupol, including Azovstal, and immediate exchange of blocked troops\u201d in Sunday\u2019s call with Erdogan. He noted that the call came before Erdogan\u2019s planned conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nUkraine has urged Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians holed up at the giant Azovstal steel plant, the last remaining Ukrainian pocket of resistance in the strategic Sea of Azov port. It also has pushed Russia to conduct talks on a safe exit for the Ukrainian defenders of the plant, but Moscow has stonewalled the demands.\n\nZelenskyy said he and Erdogan also discussed the course of the negotiation process and possible security guarantees for Ukraine from Turkey and other nations.\n\nErdogan\u2019s office said he told Zelenskyy in their call that Turkey is ready to mediate and assist in talks between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n__\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis has renewed his call for an Easter truce as Orthodox Christians celebrated Easter Sunday, when the faithful mark the resurrection of Jesus.\n\nWithout naming countries, Francis urged aggressors to \u201cstop the attack to help the suffering of the exhausted people.\u201d\n\nFrancis told a crowd gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square that two months had passed since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and said that \u201cinstead of stopping, the war got worse.

Let us reach a just end on this path \u2014 the beginning of a happy life and prosperity of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy said that \u201con Easter, we ask God for great grace to make our dream come true \u2013 this is another great day \u2014 the day when great peace will come to Ukraine.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 A Ukrainian presidential adviser has urged Russia to allow civilians to leave a steel mill in Mariupol besieged by the Russian forces.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appealed to Russia to announce a truce in Mariupol on Orthodox Easter Sunday and immediately open a humanitarian corridor for civilians holed up at the giant Azovstal steel plant. He also challenged Russia to conduct a round of talks to negotiate an exit for the Ukrainian defenders of the plant.\n\nPodolyak tweeted that the Russian military is attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery barrage and is accumulating forces and equipment for an assault.\n\nSviatoslav Palamar, an officer with the Azov Regiment defending the plant, said in a video that on Eastern Sunday the Russians are continuing to shower the plant with bombs and shell it with heavy artillery.\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military says Russian forces have continued to press their attacks in the east.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Sunday that the Russians fired on Ukrainian positions along the entire line of contact on the war\u2019s 60th day. It also said the Russian military intensified its offensive and assault operations in the Siverodonetsk, Kurakhiv and Popasna directions.\n\nA regional official in eastern Ukraine says at least eight people have been killed by the Russian shelling.\n\nLuhansk regional Governor Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that two others were wounded by the Russian barrage in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe General Staff added that Russian forces have also continued to pummel the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, hitting it with air strikes, including by long-range aircraft.\n\nThe shelling comes as the Russians are pressing their offensive in a bid to gain full control over Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland called Donbas.\n\nThe Russians have also shelled the Dnipro region west of Donbas, where at least one person was killed by a Russian missile, according to Dnipro regional Governor Valentyn Reznichenko.\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian military intelligence agency posted a statement saying the command post was hit on Friday and two generals were killed and one was critically wounded.\n\nOleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in an online interview that 50 senior Russian officers were in the command center when it came under attack. He said their fate was unknown.\n\nThe Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said new evidence is emerging that shows Russian troops killed tens of thousands of civilians in Mariupol and then tried to cover it up. He said Ukraine has intercepted Russian conversations about \u201chow they are concealing the traces of their crimes.\u201d Satellite images have shown what appear to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nZelenskyy said the Russians set up \u201cfiltration camps\u201d near Mariupol for those trying to leave the city, which has largely been reduced to rubble. He said those who survive these camps are sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East. Many of them, he said, are children.\n\nHe said he spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday about the situation in Mariupol and the general course of the war.\n\nZelenskyy promised to find and punish those responsible for the missile attack on Odesa, which he said killed eight people and wounded 18.\n\nZelenskyy urged Ukrainians to observe a curfew and not attend Orthodox Easter services overnight. The lengthy services traditionally begin late Saturday and run through Sunday morning. \u201cBut starting from 5 a.m. you may go to the church in your city, town or community,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "Could Crypto be the Unexpected Beneficiary of Present Challenges?\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, cryptocurrencies could be the unexpected beneficiary of an increasingly challenging investment landscape.\n\nTrying to move the markets with a finger proved to be challenging. (Photo by Wance Paleri on Unsplash)\n\nAsk your average Mom-and-Pop investor as to the role that cryptocurrencies play in a standard investment portfolio and the likely answer is \u201cnone.\u201d\n\nGiven how complex and volatile cryptocurrencies are, it would be entirely expected if traditional investors were to shun the digital asset class as \u201cuninvestable.\u201d\n\nYet a recent Bitwise / ETF Trends survey of financial advisers, found that 16% had allocated cryptocurrencies to client portfolios in 2021, up 9% from 2020 and more Mom-and-Pop as well as professional investors are getting in on the action.\n\nPart of the reason for this increase in cryptocurrency allocations has of course been the rising availability of options.\n\nUnlike in 2018, there are more regulated pathways to invest in cryptocurrencies than at any time in the past \u2014 from opening a basic cryptocurrency trading account at listed exchanges such as Coinbase Global, to simply tacking on to a Robinhood Markets account.\n\nAnd somewhat ironically, there are more ways for retail investors to participate in cryptocurrencies than there are for institutional investors, who need to contend with oftentimes conservative and restrictive mandates and are limited to regulated vehicles, whereas retail investors can deal with loosely-regulated exchanges and self-service decentralized forums.\n\nLast year, a slew of Bitcoin-linked ETFs hit the market and saw record inflows \u2014 the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF raised a record US$1 billion in just 2 days of listing.\n\nThat demand for cryptocurrency products in a hard institutional shells has been so great that some of Wall Street\u2019s most storied names are throwing their hat in the ring.\n\nRecently, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, the US$10 trillion BlackRock and brokerage Charles Schwab filed to register funds that track the cryptocurrency economy, while other providers continue to lobby regulators to approve more products.\n\nWhat are we betting on?\n\nTrying to guess where cryptocurrencies will head next is akin to having predicted the path of the internet in the early 1990s \u2014 there are strong parallels, but many unknown unknowns.\n\nIn 1998, American economist Paul Krugman infamously noted,\n\n\u201cThe growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in \u2018Metcalfe\u2019s law\u2019 \u2014 which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants \u2014 becomes apparent \u2014 most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet\u2019s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAlthough Krugman\u2019s observations about the internet have not aged well, it also reflects the difficulty in predicting the future when it comes to new technology.\n\nBearing in mind, when Krugman made his forecast on the future of the internet, the few people who were online had at best a dial-up internet connection and few companies (in particular Sears) saw the merit in an online presence.\n\nFast forward to our current epoch, and even JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon once declared that, \u201ccryptocurrency has no intrinsic value\u201d finds his bank not only has a presence in the Metaverse, but has his portrait hanging on the walls of his literally, digital bank branch.\n\nWhile the internet represented a new way to distribute information that could have major consequences, moving from that early observation to predicting one day people would use smartphones to rent out a stranger\u2019s house instead of staying at a hotel is a different leap altogether.\n\nWhich is why so many investors and analysts will inevitably get it wrong on cryptocurrencies, especially the seasoned and scholarly ones.\n\nRifling Through the Couch Cushions for Investments\n\nIn a week that has seen both stocks and bonds routed as the U.S. Federal Reserve doubled down on its inflation-fighting rhetoric, spooking markets that are now preparing for a 50 basis-point rate hike in May, investors are clamoring for cover in an investment landscape that appears to be providing limited respite.\n\nAnd while investors may be lamenting the 2.8% hit to the S&P 500 this past week, that damage remains but a flesh wound when held up to measures of valuation \u2014 a sign that more losses could be on the cards.\n\nAt 22-times earnings and just shy of 3 times sales, the S&P 500 is still valued at a whopping 60% more than U.S. gross domestic product, higher than at any point in time before the pandemic.\n\nNot helping matters, central banks are aggressively raising interest rates, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is jacking up commodity prices and the return of the coronavirus to China may shutter the world\u2019s factory.\n\nLast week, the sharp selloff in bonds took so-called 10-year real yields, U.S. Treasury yields with inflation stripped out, into positive territory for the first time since 2020 \u2014 which sent riskier assets from all corners of the investing world plummeting.\n\nAll of which has forced investors to search for alternatives outside of the stock and bond markets.\n\nCommodities appear attractive, given their soaring prices, but they will be the first to suffer should supply issues be ironed out and inflation kept in check by soaring interest rates.\n\nAnd contrary to popular belief, the bulk of movement in commodity prices is driven by traders speculating on the direction of the market, rather than purely demand-driven price pressures, which do not make for strong long-term fundamentals.\n\nFloating rates of private credit and yields from public fixed income look tempting as well, but the best deals are often beyond the reach of retail investors, as is venture capital and recession-related risks have already been baked into returns.\n\nReal estate is sensitive to interest rate hikes and should wages not keep up with inflation, serve as a potential headwind for a sector that has only seen prices go up since the 2008 Financial Crisis.\n\nEmerging market assets look alluring as the dollar strengthens, but geopolitics are raising risks and reducing liquidity as the world becomes increasingly polarized.\n\nSo where does that leave investors?\n\nVirtually every other asset class has well-established valuation matrices and long histories with deep data troves for analysis.\n\nCryptocurrencies and their attendant blockchains however, represent potential that the world has yet to fully understand or grasp making them ripe for both extremes of optimism and pessimism.\n\nTo dismiss cryptocurrencies as purely a technology play is to ignore the fact that they sit at the nexus of finance, technology, game theory, behavioral economics and monetary systems \u2014 portable power.\n\nThe same way the internet had limited value when it consisted of just a handful of terminals connected over the ARPANET, when Bitcoin was being transferred between a clutch of early adopters, 10,000 Bitcoin could only be exchanged for two pizzas at Papa Johns.\n\nToday, Bitcoin serves as legal tender alongside the dollar in El Salvador and Mexico is mulling a similar move.\n\nWhen Western sanctions were leveled against Russia for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, ordinary Russians looking to protect the value of their assets sent ruble-crypto trading pairs soaring overnight, with between 8 to 16 times the typical volume.\n\nAnd when Ukraine desperately needed financial and military aid to combat the invaders, a portion of that aid came in the form of cryptocurrency donations, requiring no financial intermediary to effect the assistance to buy everything from flak jackets to ammunition.\n\nIn 2018, few (if any) governments took the threat of cryptocurrencies seriously, whether as a challenge to the supremacy of fiat currencies or as a means by which to circumvent taxation and sanctions.\n\nFast forward to our present time and the Biden administration is actively moving towards developing a comprehensive policy approach to cryptocurrencies and the European Central Bank is mulling the issuance of its own digital currency, while China has already had one for some time.\n\nWhereas the internet needed advances in the actual hardware that was necessary to advance the disruptive and transformative effect of the World Wide Web as we know it today, cryptocurrencies are solving hard problems with software solutions meaning that their development and application expansion will be faster (no fiber optic cables to lay down here).\n\nTake the allegation that cryptocurrency mining is a wasteful use of electricity for instance \u2014 later this year, the world\u2019s second most valuable blockchain by market cap, Ethereum, will be attempting a significant shift from the energy-intensive proof-of-work method to secure the blockchain to a far more energy- efficient proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nOther blockchains such as Solana, Cardano and Algorand already utilize proof-of-stake, although they\u2019re not as popular or as widely used as Ethereum.\n\nUnlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies don\u2019t lend themselves well to typical valuation metrics, because it\u2019s not possible to value a blockchain on the basis of profits or sales.\n\nYet cryptocurrencies themselves can have far more value than equity in many ways, as they allow stakeholders to have a vote that can determine the development of their respective blockchains, including on matters such as fees and distribution plans.\n\nImagine if a minority stake in Apple enabled shareholders to have a meaningful say in the company\u2019s privacy policies or the remuneration of its top executives \u2014 while ordinary stock can\u2019t necessarily facilitate such actions, cryptocurrencies can enable and empower the exercise of such rights.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to take for granted our current ability to transfer vast amounts of information across the internet today, not so long ago, this would have been the stuff of science fiction.\n\nNow imagine if our economic lives could be borderless as well \u2014 if we could transfer value whenever we needed to whoever needed it, execute a contract without ever having met our counterparty, and effect a trade without ever going through a broker.\n\nBecause we\u2019re only just beginning to explore what\u2019s possible with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain is also why they\u2019re so difficult to value.\n\nMarkets Know the Price of Everything But the Value of Nothing\n\nGiven how any meaningful engagement with cryptocurrencies is multidisciplinary, converging expertise in computer science, behavioral economics and financial services, predicting their transformative value and development potential is not a simple task, let alone price discovery.\n\nAnd that\u2019s also the reason why cryptocurrencies are so often simultaneously under and overvalued.\n\nBy most traditional measures, Bitcoin, and the rest of the US$2 trillion cryptocurrency sector should have crashed by now, that they haven\u2019t isn\u2019t necessarily testimony to their resilience, but the lack of leverage lingering in the cryptocurrency markets at this moment.\n\nRaising interest rates to combat inflation also means that the risk-free rate of return rises, and so more investors won\u2019t necessarily be as desperate for yield, which makes risk assets, including cryptocurrencies less attractive \u2014 or so goes the argument.\n\nWhile leverage is prevalent with traditional financial assets, it has actually decreased in recent months when it\u2019s come to cryptocurrencies \u2014 too many traders got burned in the great crypto deleveraging episodes throughout 2021.\n\nBut because Bitcoin is now increasingly viewed by professional investors as a component of the speculative class, it is not immune to central bank hawkishness and even though other cryptocurrencies bring different value propositions to Bitcoin, can\u2019t rise against a receding tide.\n\nGiven the myriad challenges facing asset markets, nothing is doing well.\n\nFrom the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to central bank policy tightening, China\u2019s insistence on zero-Covid lockdowns and soaring inflation \u2014 regardless of the asset concerned, there is some reason to be bearish.\n\nTech stocks have been hammered while bond yields have soared (yields rise inversely to bond prices).\n\nCrude oil stumbled on concerns over Chinese demand while gold, typically regarded as a inflation haven asset, fell as yields soared \u2014 the precious metal after all is a non-yielding asset and if investors believe that central banks will keep raising rates to combat inflation, there\u2019s little incentive to justify holding on to the precious metal.\n\nAgainst this bearish backdrop, investors need to ask themselves which assets will fair well when our current troubles are eventually resolved.\n\nAnd while there\u2019s no guarantee that cryptocurrencies will be that asset to plug forward \u2014 there are at least enough reasons that will become apparent with the benefit of hindsight.",

Professional and retail investors alike have sparred over how much of an investment portfolio should be allocated to crypto, if any at all.\n\nNonetheless, the trend towards retail and institutional adoption of crypto has marched on, spurred by its enticingly high returns, promises of decentralized financial systems, and increasing use cases.\n\nWith the price of the dominant cryptocurrency by market cap, (CRYPTO:BTC), hovering around the $40,000 support level over the last few weeks, many investors may be considering establishing a position. The question now is, how much of your portfolio should be in Bitcoin?\n\nWhat the smart money says Some investors are die-hard crypto bulls, with anywhere from 25% to 100% of their portfolios in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Others fear the asset altogether, preferring to stick to traditional stocks and index funds. Fortunately, Bitcoin can be held in moderation. It\u2019s not all or nothing.\n\nAccording to a study by Yale University economist Aleh Tsyvinski, investment portfolios should have anywhere from a 1% to 6% Bitcoin allocation for diversification purposes \u2014 1% if you\u2019re pessimistic, 3-4% if you\u2019re neutral, and +6% if you\u2019re optimistic.\n\nThe reason behind this is that Bitcoin has a decently low correlation to other asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, golds, and commodities \u2014 that is, when those assets zig, Bitcoin tends to zag.\n\nThis, coupled with its high volatility, gives it a pretty good diversification benefit when added to a portfolio. By adding Bitcoin, we limit our exposure to any single asset and its risk.\n\nCouple this with its potential for seriously high returns, and what you have is a great asset to add for improving your portfolio\u2019s overall risk-return profile. For example, in the last five years, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index returned a great 155%. Bitcoin absolutely trounced this with a 2,804% return.\n\nHow do I buy Bitcoin? The best way to hold Bitcoin as part of your investment portfolio is to buy it on an exchange and then transfer it to cold storage. Traditionally, Canadian investors bought Bitcoin on coin exchanges, such as Binance, Shakepay, Newton, or Wealthsimple Crypto. Then you can transfer it to your \u201ccold wallet\u201d via your \u201cprivate key\u201d to keep it safe.\n\nCanadian investors can also buy Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their TFSAs or RRSPs. These ETFs hold the underlying Bitcoin in offline cold storage with a custodian and divvy it up into shares, which are bought and sold on the stock market during normal trading hours.\n\nThe first approach allows you to actually own your own Bitcoin (the saying \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d applies here), but you are taxed when you sell. You also have to exercise a high degree of responsibility to safeguard your cold wallet and private key as to not lose your Bitcoin.\n\nThe second approach allows you to sell Bitcoin tax free or tax deferred, as you can now buy it in a TFSA or RRSP. However, you don\u2019t physically own the Bitcoin \u2014 just shares of a fund tracking it. These funds also charge a management expense ratio of around 1% per year, which will cost you.\n\nThe Foolish takeaway Ultimately, the question of whether or not you should add Bitcoin to your investment portfolio depends on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Investors who \u201cHODL\u201d Bitcoin for a sufficient length of time to ride out the volatility almost always enjoy juicy returns, especially when halving cycles hit. However, not many can stomach the roller coaster of gains and losses Bitcoin experiences on a daily basis, let alone over weeks. As with all risky assets, properly assessing your investment objectives is a must.\n\nThe post How Much Bitcoin Should You Hold in Your Investment Portfolio?

            "text": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for financial products (lending, trading, savings etc.) that don\u2019t require a centralized institution like a bank or exchange broker. Instead, they run on smart contracts, which are automatically executed when certain conditions are met. Users transact directly with each other and maintain control over their assets.\n\nFirst DeFi apps appeared around 2017, but it was in 2020-2021 that the market really exploded, reaching a valuation of $100B. Apps like Compound, Curve and Uniswap handle billions in volume.\n\nNevertheless, the DeFi industry is facing some formidable challenges. Perhaps the biggest is connecting fiat (traditional currencies, like USD) and crypto. The general consensus is that DeFi can and should foster the coexistence of both fiat and crypto - but how? This guide explores the most promising solutions.\n\nProviding Bank Lending Services for Both Crypto and Fiat\n\nRelated: Decentralized Finance Is on the Rise. What You Need to Know in 2021\n\nDeFi can generate a synergy of crypto and fiat by integrating traditional currencies in decentralized financial products. After all, fiat-based banking systems have been the lifeblood of the global economy for as long as there HAS been a global economy. Banking services such as easy lending contribute vastly to the sustainability of the financial sector globally and to the citizens who rely on loans in their daily lives.\n\nDeFi can unite the crypto and fiat worlds by providing similar lending and banking services using BOTH types of currencies in tandem. Examples include Compound, MELD and Aave. Most of these platforms offer loans in crypto and also in fiat, backed by an existing stake, or the converse. By doing this, a DeFi network crypto holders with faster access to standard fiat assets without losing or diluting their existing crypto stake.\n\nAlready, there are multiple DeFi networks providing lending services using both fiat and crypto. Offering cash loans by using crypto as collateral is a good way of fostering this type of old and new currency coexistence.\n\nAllow Fiat Backing in Stablecoins\n\nRelated: The Path to Stability: How Stablecoins Can Drive Borderless Business Across Europe\n\nAnother promising way to allow the coexistence of crypto and DeFi is by leveraging the concept of stablecoins. Stablecoins are simply a class of crypto assets backed by another asset such as Gold, commodities or fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar.\n\nHowever, it is vital that more upcoming DeFi projects provide similar stablecoin services to allow for the coexistence of both crypto and fiat in the financial sector. As stablecoins increase, so will their users, resulting in faster crypto adoption.\n\nLending Fiat Liquidity\n\nAnother way for DeFi projects to help ensure coexistence between crypto and fiat is by allowing fiat liquidity pools. A fiat liquidity provider offers its fiat assets to a lending pool - their fiat assets are then used to give other people loans.\n\nOne of the existing platforms providing fiat liquidity options is the MELD Protocol. The network will allow investors and institutions to offer fiat liquidity by using the MELD app on mobile, desktop or Web. In the process, the investors will earn yields in high APYs. On top of lending fiat liquidity, this platform will also allow investors to use their line of credit, thus making crypto assets even more liquid.\n\nAllow Investors to Earn Income with Fiat and Crypto\n\nRelated: Build New Wealth by Circumventing Old Money\n\nSavings accounts remain one of the most popular banking products, though falling interest rates and rising inflation mean that real yields on such accounts are zero or even sub-zero. DeFi projects offer similar savings products but provide higher earnings. DeFi yield farming is an excellent example: users lock up crypto tokens and get rewarded with more tokens daily, with nominal APYs often above 100%.\n\nDeFi projects often require other investors to deposit their assets in a liquidity pool (savings account equivalent). The asset is then lent to someone else who offers another asset as collateral.\n\nWhen lending cash, DeFi projects will often create a liquidity pool for depositing cash, with the cash then offered to others who collateralize crypto in return. However, in this case, the individuals depositing fiat will earn rewards in interest after the loan repayment.\n\nIncreasing Ease of Exchanging Crypto and Fiat\n\nRelated: Here's How You Can Tap into DeFi to Maximize Profitability\n\nProviding better liquidity of crypto tokens is another way for the Defi space to co-exist with both crypto and fiat. Already, there are many crypto exchanges today offering liquidity for assets - however, it takes a lot of time to change the tokens back into cash with most of them. They are not highly-liquid by default.\n\nHowever, DeFi projects can help streamline the issue. There are many ways through which this can be accomplished.\n\nExpert Ken Olling, noted several options: \u201cOne is by providing the option to purchase crypto directly with bank accounts or other fiat options. Decentralized exchange platforms, for instance, can make it easy for investors to buy crypto using credit cards. By doing that, there will be ease in converting fiat to crypto.\n\nSecondly, DeFi projects can provide instant cash access for those holding DeFi assets. The lending platforms can give crypto investors a line of credit. Moreover, Defi projects can link with banking institutions and other money changers. The result will provide more ease towards exchanging crypto to fiat and vice versa.\u201d\n\nFinal Word\n\nThis guide has been exploring how DeFi can provide coexistence between crypto and fiat. There is a high need to ensure a good link between fiat and crypto for the two to co-exist. DeFi has already been playing a major role in linking fiat and crypto-assets.\n\nDeFi networks provide essential services such as lending and yield farming, all of which can provide space for fiats. In lending, DeFi projects allow people to access fiat loans by using crypto as collateral. By doing that, they provide a pool for investors to offer fiat liquidity. There is no question that DeFi is a powerful new tool in the financial market to bring more money to more people in a safe, liquid and disruptive fashion.",

            "text": "\u2018Plan the trade, trade the plan\u2026\u2019 After a month of being taught the ins and outs of crypto-trading, these words are firmly imprinted into my brain.\n\nJust four weeks ago I knew nothing \u2013 and I mean nothing \u2013 about how the cryptocurrency finance market. But with Bitcoin becoming a buzzword, I often wondered if I was missing a trick. So when Metro.co.uk offered to pair me up with crypto guru Patrick Reid in a bid to see if a complete novice could learn the ropes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nBefore our first Zoom meeting, I recalled the feeling of sitting at the back of Mrs Barry\u2019s class again at Hazelwick School in Crawley and not knowing my times tables. Would I really be able to do this?\n\nHowever, as I began to chat to Patrick, it was clear he knew his stuff. A highly successful trader, he\u2019s also co-founder of The Adamis Principle, a niche FX [foreign exchange] consultancy full of financial market whizzes.\n\nHe promised to walk me through everything gently, and it\u2019s just as well. Among the higher grades I got, scraping a \u2018C\u2019 at GCSE Maths has to be one of my greatest achievements \u2013 so bracing myself for the Bitcoin market was somewhat intimidating \u2013 no scrap that, terrifying.\n\nWhat even was a bit coin? A shiny platinum penny they sent you in the post after you\u2019d bought some stock?\n\nTurns out that a Bitcoin is a digital currency which operates free of any central control or the oversight of banks or governments.\n\nPatrick suggested that I invest a small amount initially \u2013 roughly between \u00a350 and \u00a3500 \u2013 but to start thriftly and increase in my own time as my \u2018talent\u2019 for the market grew.\n\nUsing the money app Revolut \u2013 which allows you to invest and was pretty easy to follow, thank god \u2013 Patrick showed me a chart that looks like a dodgy heartbeat. This was it; this was the market \u2013 and I was going to try and get my head round it. He started off slowly with some explanations \u2013 which surprisingly, I managed to follow.\n\nCan anyone learn to trade in cryptocurrency? Journalist and publisher Sally Windsor decided to find out with the help of finance guru Patrick Reid (Picture: Supplied)\n\nSo Stage One was pattern recognition. We looked at what the market did and how well it did it. This meant looking at where the peaks were on the chart and where the lows were too. I could recognise which bits went up and down \u2013 achievement number one. I knew the difference between up and down. It was a shaky start, but I was determined to get my head around this stuff.\n\nDown the right-hand side ran all the amounts of where the market was priced at. Five digit numbers mainly starting with a \u20184\u2019\u2026 something, something.\n\nFrom there, based on previous price action \u2013 we made a bias as to what it could do next. How on earth did I know what would happen next? Patrick insisted that all you had to do was watch and go with your gut.\n\nPatrick also told me about mid-Bollinger bands \u2013 a type of statistical chart characterising the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or commodity, using a formulaic method propounded by John Bollinger in the 1980s. I shocked myself with understanding them.\n\nThe purpose of Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low prices of a market. By definition, prices are high at the upper band and low at the lower band.\n\nStage Two was the risk, reward and execution. Before we pulled the buy trigger for a Bitcoin purchase, we looked at the potential reward and made sure it was more than what we could have lost.\n\nI was prepared for a loss, I mean \u2013 beginners\u2019 luck wasn\u2019t something I particularly believe in. You make your own luck in my world. But I couldn\u2019t help but hope that fortune would smile on me.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t help but hope that fortune would smile on me\u2019: Sally begins her trading journey (Picture: Sally Windsor)\n\nI decided to invest \u00a350 to text the waters, with a view to putting more in and pushing the button on the app was like a dopamine hit. Great fun and full of excitement. My friend Steve likened it to gambling, and I saw his point. With an addictive personality, you could get easily hooked this stuff\u2026 and I have that in abundance.\n\n\u2018All the press coverage on how you can get-rich-quick is nonsense,\u2019 Steve also said. Many others take this stance and would never consider investing. Perhaps risk is just too anxiety-provoking. Why would we choose to put ourselves through that? I did wonder.\n\nStage Three was managing the trade. We had done the hard work and now we manage the the trade we\u2019d done. Had it gone our favour and do we take profit? Or has it gone against us and do we ease out of the trade? The risk was exactly at this point and a little nerve-wracking. I checked my Revolut account, then checked it again.\n\n\u2018Managing risk is the key for success,\u2019 Patrick said and I trusted his vast experience.\n\nIt was at our third meeting that Patrick imparted his most famous words of wisdom on me.\n\n\u2018If we plan the trade and trade the plan \u2013 the outcome does not really matter because it is just noise,\u2019 he said. \u2018The hardest part of trading is sitting on your hands.\u2019 I felt it, the wait was kind of infuriating.\n\n\u2018When asked why I got into the game, most traders say they wanted to make money,\u2019 Patrick told me. \u2018But in my experience \u2013 the really successful ones do it for the passion.\u2019 And Patrick was testament to this.\n\nFinally, Stage Four was closure and learning to be better next time. Two weeks after first meeting Patrick, we decided to sell my Bitcoin. The market was up a touch from the amount I bought at and it felt like a good time to do it. I sold my Bitcoin via Revolut, making \u00a320 profit, which felt quite exciting.\n\nMy first trade was complete. Take that, GCSE Maths.\n\nTake that, GCSE Maths (Picture: Sally Windsor)\n\nPatrick and I were at peace with the outcome and did everything we could.\n\nSometimes the market has its own ideas which do not run with ours. That is absolutely fine because I have already moved onto my next trade, knowing it is just one of a thousand ahead of us.\n\nFrom knowing nothing about Bitcoin, after a months\u2019 tuition I\u2019m on the road to making some decent cash. I mean, I\u2019m not about to buy my friends and I the week-long spa break we all deserve, but everyone starts somewhere.\n\nPatrick has told me I was the ideal student, who took instruction and acted appropriately. I\u2019m proud of my new skill.\n\nI\u2019ll continue trading, and yes \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll catch the bug. But in today\u2019s society, if there\u2019s a way to help yourself along this bumpy road, shouldn\u2019t we be embracing it wholeheartedly?\n\nBitcoin is similar to life itself. It has its ups and downs, but you pull through it and go with the flow. Who knew cryptocurrency could be likened to spirituality? Perhaps it was a bit of karma and luck that came my way after all.\n\nMORE : Climate groups urge Bitcoin to change coding to cut energy consumption by 99%\n\nMORE : Jack Dorsey sets up \u2018legal defence fund\u2019 to protect Bitcoin developers",

In the past week or so, roughly 56 200 Ether, or about $170 million worth of stolen cryptocurrencies was moved out of the main address on the Ethereum blockchain used by the perpetrators, blockchain data shows.

It announced last Friday on its Twitter account that it is using a free compliance tool developed by Chainalysis to block crypto wallets targeted by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. The tool, launched by Chainalysis in March, is a free smart contract, or a program run on a blockchain, that scans for crypto addresses that are sanctioned by several governments. Chainalysis also provides paid products that alert their customers to indirect exposure to sanctioned addresses and other addresses they identified as linked to sanctioned entities beyond what\u2019s included on the OFAC\u2019s sanctions list.\n\nA spokesperson from Chainalysis said the firm cannot confirm Tornado Cash is using their tool because the program is not embedded on Tornado Cash\u2019s own codes, or smart contract. According to Tornado Cash, the compliance tool was only used to block sanctioned addresses from using the user-facing decentralized application. In theory, blocked addresses can still gain access to the underlying technology of Tornado Cash by transferring the crypto to another address first. Tornado Cash founders did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the tool and its effectiveness.\n\nOn Friday, one of the addresses that received 10 129.935 Ether from the hacker\u2019s main address sent about 1 528 Ether to a second new address, according to blockchain data.

The European Union has been quite warm regarding crypto adoption, a lot of companies have since then jumped into the emerging space.\n\nMedia Markt was in partnership with Coinfinity and its spinoff Kurant, the company started testing the ATMs and also the pilot installation.\n\nWith increased client interest, crypto ATMs would be a great way to exchange fiat currencies with cryptocurrencies in a hassle-free way. Initially, the testing had begun in Vienna at one of its stores, after which Media Markt has finally decided on 12 locations.\n\nAttracting New Clients By Launching Bitcoin ATMs\n\nIn order to buy Bitcoin, Kurant vending machines would be used, which is the spinoff of Coinfinity, Kurant currently has around 200 Bitcoin ATMs. All these ATMs are spread across European locations which include Austria, Germany, Greece, and Spain.\n\nInstalling such machines in the retail business could attract more newcomers to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, stated Stefan Grill, Kurant\u2019s Managing Director.\n\nAustria has been a European precursor in Bitcoin adoption and ATM establishment. Austria now has around 139 operating Bitcoin ATMs which are called Bitcoin Teller Machines (BTM).\n\nBitcoin vending machines have been installed in MediaMarkt stores across the country. These are now available in twelve marketplaces and allow for the simple and secure purchase of cryptocurrencies, Thomas Sperneder, Kurant\u2019s Europe Head of Marketing and Sales stated.\n\nCrypto transactions are much cheaper when compared to traditional institutions or fiat currencies. These BTMs will allow BTC users to cash out the crypto as well as deposit fiat currencies.

Other countries such as Croatia and Mexico have recently made an entrance into the BTM space which is still in its nascent stage.\n\nKonzum, Croatia\u2019s leading food producer and supermarket chain accepted many digital assets as payment methods.\n\nThe digital assets included prominent currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and USDT. The company collaborated with a local fintech company Electrocoin, which was Croatia\u2019s first-ever crypto payment predecessor.\n\nElectrocoin guarantees a buyer a fixed exchange rate at the beginning of the transaction and ensures the successful processing of the particular transaction.\n\nMexico\u2019s supermarket chain Elektra partnered with BitBay which would help customers pay bills through cryptocurrencies instead of fiat currencies. Elektra however, remains unaccountable for the losses and scams incurred through the risks of processing payments in crypto.\n\nRelated Reading | Walmart Hosts 200 Bitcoin ATMs: Easy-To-Use Options Diversify Users",

            "channel": "entrepreneur.com",
            "text": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for financial products (lending, trading, savings etc.) that don\u2019t require a centralized institution like a bank or exchange broker. Instead, they run on smart contracts, which are automatically executed when certain conditions are met. Users transact directly with each other and maintain control over their assets.\n\nFirst DeFi apps appeared around 2017, but it was in 2020-2021 that the market really exploded, reaching a valuation of $100B. Apps like Compound, Curve and Uniswap handle billions in volume.\n\nNevertheless, the DeFi industry is facing some formidable challenges. Perhaps the biggest is connecting fiat (traditional currencies, like USD) and crypto. The general consensus is that DeFi can and should foster the coexistence of both fiat and crypto - but how? This guide explores the most promising solutions.\n\nProviding Bank Lending Services for Both Crypto and Fiat\n\nRelated: Decentralized Finance Is on the Rise. What You Need to Know in 2021\n\nDeFi can generate a synergy of crypto and fiat by integrating traditional currencies in decentralized financial products. After all, fiat-based banking systems have been the lifeblood of the global economy for as long as there HAS been a global economy. Banking services such as easy lending contribute vastly to the sustainability of the financial sector globally and to the citizens who rely on loans in their daily lives.\n\nDeFi can unite the crypto and fiat worlds by providing similar lending and banking services using BOTH types of currencies in tandem. Examples include Compound, MELD and Aave. Most of these platforms offer loans in crypto and also in fiat, backed by an existing stake, or the converse. By doing this, a DeFi network crypto holders with faster access to standard fiat assets without losing or diluting their existing crypto stake.\n\nAlready, there are multiple DeFi networks providing lending services using both fiat and crypto. Offering cash loans by using crypto as collateral is a good way of fostering this type of old and new currency coexistence.\n\nAllow Fiat Backing in Stablecoins\n\nRelated: The Path to Stability: How Stablecoins Can Drive Borderless Business Across Europe\n\nAnother promising way to allow the coexistence of crypto and DeFi is by leveraging the concept of stablecoins. Stablecoins are simply a class of crypto assets backed by another asset such as Gold, commodities or fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar.\n\nHowever, it is vital that more upcoming DeFi projects provide similar stablecoin services to allow for the coexistence of both crypto and fiat in the financial sector. As stablecoins increase, so will their users, resulting in faster crypto adoption.\n\nLending Fiat Liquidity\n\nAnother way for DeFi projects to help ensure coexistence between crypto and fiat is by allowing fiat liquidity pools. A fiat liquidity provider offers its fiat assets to a lending pool - their fiat assets are then used to give other people loans.\n\nOne of the existing platforms providing fiat liquidity options is the MELD Protocol. The network will allow investors and institutions to offer fiat liquidity by using the MELD app on mobile, desktop or Web. In the process, the investors will earn yields in high APYs. On top of lending fiat liquidity, this platform will also allow investors to use their line of credit, thus making crypto assets even more liquid.\n\nAllow Investors to Earn Income with Fiat and Crypto\n\nRelated: Build New Wealth by Circumventing Old Money\n\nSavings accounts remain one of the most popular banking products, though falling interest rates and rising inflation mean that real yields on such accounts are zero or even sub-zero. DeFi projects offer similar savings products but provide higher earnings. DeFi yield farming is an excellent example: users lock up crypto tokens and get rewarded with more tokens daily, with nominal APYs often above 100%.\n\nDeFi projects often require other investors to deposit their assets in a liquidity pool (savings account equivalent). The asset is then lent to someone else who offers another asset as collateral.\n\nWhen lending cash, DeFi projects will often create a liquidity pool for depositing cash, with the cash then offered to others who collateralize crypto in return. However, in this case, the individuals depositing fiat will earn rewards in interest after the loan repayment.\n\nIncreasing Ease of Exchanging Crypto and Fiat\n\nRelated: Here's How You Can Tap into DeFi to Maximize Profitability\n\nProviding better liquidity of crypto tokens is another way for the Defi space to co-exist with both crypto and fiat. Already, there are many crypto exchanges today offering liquidity for assets - however, it takes a lot of time to change the tokens back into cash with most of them. They are not highly-liquid by default.\n\nHowever, DeFi projects can help streamline the issue. There are many ways through which this can be accomplished.\n\nExpert Ken Olling, noted several options: \u201cOne is by providing the option to purchase crypto directly with bank accounts or other fiat options. Decentralized exchange platforms, for instance, can make it easy for investors to buy crypto using credit cards. By doing that, there will be ease in converting fiat to crypto.\n\nSecondly, DeFi projects can provide instant cash access for those holding DeFi assets. The lending platforms can give crypto investors a line of credit. Moreover, Defi projects can link with banking institutions and other money changers. The result will provide more ease towards exchanging crypto to fiat and vice versa.\u201d\n\nFinal Word\n\nThis guide has been exploring how DeFi can provide coexistence between crypto and fiat. There is a high need to ensure a good link between fiat and crypto for the two to co-exist. DeFi has already been playing a major role in linking fiat and crypto-assets.\n\nDeFi networks provide essential services such as lending and yield farming, all of which can provide space for fiats. In lending, DeFi projects allow people to access fiat loans by using crypto as collateral. By doing that, they provide a pool for investors to offer fiat liquidity. There is no question that DeFi is a powerful new tool in the financial market to bring more money to more people in a safe, liquid and disruptive fashion.",

Still, it would be a strategic alternative to the current means of payment.\n\nThe Bank of Mexico is working closely with the Bank of International Settlements to develop its CBDC; however, the road is not easy. There is a lot of work ahead. Recently, the pro-bitcoin senator Indira Kempis introduced a bill to include a CBDC into the legal system, paving the way for a successful implementation.",

While the region faces some obstacles due to its economic traits and the dominance of centralized banks, the organization believes there is a lucrative opening for companies partnering with these banks to bring crypto to the masses.\n\nRipple Spots Opportunities in Latam\n\nRipple, the banking payments, remittances, and cryptocurrency company, believes that Latam could be a hotspot of opportunities for crypto companies in the future. In a recent article, Ripple examines the current payments and the possible integration that crypto services may find in the region. According to the company, crypto companies might find these openings when banks start integrating cryptocurrency services into their platforms.\n\nAbout this idea, the company stated:\n\nThere is a lucrative opening for traditional banks, fintechs and governments to increase adoption of crypto-forward technology to address this underbanked and fragmented market.\n\nThis points to the idea of crypto companies collaborating with banks and fintech companies to take an active role amongst the main rails to transact and make payments in these countries.\n\nBarriers to the Process\n\nHowever, this integration process would likely not be without its hiccups. Traditional payment rails are managed by banks in the region, and banking inclusion is very high in some of the largest countries, with Brazil and Chile having 88% and 82% of their population banked, respectively. The opportunities come in the form of offering services with lower fees than traditional institutions, which could make people move from cash and other payment methods to digital transactions.\n\nThe inclusion of crypto companies in the different debates that are happening regarding regulation will also be very important for the future of crypto in the region, according to the article. Ripple believes that this process will be positive, stating that:\n\nSmart and progressive regulation will beget further successful regulation \u2014 leading to increased innovation and progress around crypto across Latin America.\n\nIn this sense, there is a regulatory awakening in the continent, with countries like Brazil and El Salvador leading the pack when it comes to crypto regulation. Brazilian legislators have vowed to present a unified regulation for cryptocurrency assets before the Congress to be approved in the coming months, and El Salvador declared bitcoin legal tender last year with the approval of its Bitcoin Law.\n\nThis presented scenario also includes a progressive detachment from the dollar and U.S. markets, which currently have significant influence in the region. On this, Ripple concluded:\n\nThe possibility of insulation from other regions\u2019 financial swings underscores a major reason why achieving interoperability across Latin America and avoiding the de-risking trend in the US is so critical for LATAM economies.\n\nWhat do you think about Ripple\u2019s opinion regarding the future of crypto in Latam? Tell us in the comments section below.\n\nSergio Goschenko Sergio is a cryptocurrency journalist based in Venezuela. He describes himself as late to the game, entering the cryptosphere when the price rise happened during December 2017. Having a computer engineering background, living in Venezuela, and being impacted by the cryptocurrency boom at a social level, he offers a different point of view about crypto success and how it helps the unbanked and underserved.\n\n\n\nImage Credits: Shutterstock, Pixabay, Wiki Commons\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only.

The controversial businessman clarified, however, that Tesla will most likely accept Bitcoin payments when it becomes more eco-friendly. Many environmentalists are against cryptocurrency mining, because it uses a lot of energy and pollutes the world.\n\nWhile being an energy hog isn\u2019t the reason Bitcoin is a risky asset, cryptos can\u2019t attract ESG investors. However, some crypto miners are going clean and green to allay fears of environmental consequences. Vancouver-based HIVE Blockchain Technologies (TSXV:HIVE)(NASDAQ:HVBT) can win over investors looking for eco-friendly investments.\n\nThe $905.76 million miner of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic uses 100% renewable energy. Management said that since day one, TSX\u2019s first publicly listed crypto miner uses relatively low-cost, green or renewable energy.\n\nCommitted ESG strategy\n\nHIVE operates in cool and politically stable jurisdictions, namely Canada, Iceland, and Sweden. In Canada, green energy (30 MW energy capacity) powers its dedicated cryptocurrency mining operation. The electricity used in the state-of-the-art blockchain infrastructure facility in Iceland comes from geothermal and hydro resources.\n\nIn Sweden, HIVE\u2019s graphic processing unit (GPU) facilities uses hydro electricity (17 MW) only. For Ethereum mining, the company equips the facility with custom and efficient GPU rigs. With 50 MW of green power in its date centres, HIVE is one of the largest and most diversified cryptocurrency miners in the world.\n\nPure-play blockchain investment\n\nThe crypto stock, like cryptocurrencies, underperformed year to date. Still, HIVE had a solid performance in the last 3.01 years, with a total return of more than 200% (44% CAGR). The current share price of $2.21 (-33.23% year to date) is a good entry point. Market analysts covering HIVE are bullish. Their 12-month average price target is $5.02, or an upside potential of 127.15%.\n\nFrank Holmes, HIVE\u2019s executive chairman, said, \u201cWe are very pleased to report HIVE has continued its extremely strong momentum in expanding our hashing power.\u201d He pointed to the mining hash power of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company produces BTC daily, on average.\n\nUnlike direct exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptos, would-be investors have a basis for making sound decisions. For example, HIVE\u2019s total revenue from digital currency mining in Q3 fiscal 2022 (quarter ended December 31, 2021) climbed 397% versus Q3 fiscal 2021.\n\nNotably, net income rose 273.26% to US$64.2 million compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year. According to management, the factors for the significant increases were gross mining margin, higher Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, gains on the sale of digital currencies, and foreign exchange.\n\nU.S. expansion\n\nHIVE is upbeat in 2022 and looks to double its Bitcoin mining rate. The company signed a deal with chipmaker Intel to acquire the new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips. HIVE is expanding in the U.S., as it also struck a preliminary deal with Compute North. HIVE will host the renewable energy facility (100 MW) of Texas-based mining infrastructure provider.\n\nGreat business model\n\nHIVE is beaten down but not out in 2022. Because of its great business model, some analysts say it\u2019s one of the TSX tech stocks that could multiply in value.",

            "text": "\u00a9 Reuters. ESG Investors: This Crypto Stock Uses 100% Renewable Energy\n\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ: ), reneged on his pronouncement that the electric carmaker will accept as payment. The controversial businessman clarified, however, that Tesla will most likely accept Bitcoin payments when it becomes more eco-friendly. Many environmentalists are against cryptocurrency mining, because it uses a lot of energy and pollutes the world.\n\nWhile being an energy hog isn\u2019t the reason Bitcoin is a risky asset, cryptos can\u2019t attract ESG investors. However, some crypto miners are going clean and green to allay fears of environmental consequences. Vancouver-based HIVE Blockchain Technologies (TSXV:HIVE)(NASDAQ:HVBT) can win over investors looking for eco-friendly investments.\n\nThe $905.76 million miner of Bitcoin, , and uses 100% renewable energy. Management said that since day one, TSX\u2019s first publicly listed crypto miner uses relatively low-cost, green or renewable energy.\n\nCommitted ESG strategy HIVE operates in cool and politically stable jurisdictions, namely Canada, Iceland, and Sweden. In Canada, green energy (30 MW energy capacity) powers its dedicated cryptocurrency mining operation. The electricity used in the state-of-the-art blockchain infrastructure facility in Iceland comes from geothermal and hydro resources.\n\nIn Sweden, HIVE\u2019s graphic processing unit (GPU) facilities uses hydro electricity (17 MW) only. For Ethereum mining, the company equips the facility with custom and efficient GPU rigs. With 50 MW of green power in its date centres, HIVE is one of the largest and most diversified cryptocurrency miners in the world.\n\nPure-play blockchain investment The crypto stock, like cryptocurrencies, underperformed year to date. Still, HIVE had a solid performance in the last 3.01 years, with a total return of more than 200% (44% CAGR). The current share price of $2.21 (-33.23% year to date) is a good entry point. Market analysts covering HIVE are bullish. Their 12-month average price target is $5.02, or an upside potential of 127.15%.\n\nFrank Holmes, HIVE\u2019s executive chairman, said, \u201cWe are very pleased to report HIVE has continued its extremely strong momentum in expanding our hashing power.\u201d He pointed to the mining hash power of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company produces BTC daily, on average.\n\nUnlike direct exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptos, would-be investors have a basis for making sound decisions. For example, HIVE\u2019s total revenue from digital currency mining in Q3 fiscal 2022 (quarter ended December 31, 2021) climbed 397% versus Q3 fiscal 2021.\n\nNotably, net income rose 273.26% to US$64.2 million compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year. According to management, the factors for the significant increases were gross mining margin, higher Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, gains on the sale of digital currencies, and foreign exchange.\n\nU.S. expansion HIVE is upbeat in 2022 and looks to double its Bitcoin mining rate. The company signed a deal with chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ: ) to acquire the new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips. HIVE is expanding in the U.S., as it also struck a preliminary deal with Compute North. HIVE will host the renewable energy facility (100 MW) of Texas-based mining infrastructure provider.\n\nGreat business model HIVE is beaten down but not out in 2022. Because of its great business model, some analysts say it\u2019s one of the tech stocks that could multiply in value.\n\nThe post ESG Investors: This Crypto Stock Uses 100% Renewable Energy appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.\n\nFool contributor Christopher Liew has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

            "text": "Could Crypto be the Unexpected Beneficiary of Present Challenges?\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, cryptocurrencies could be the unexpected beneficiary of an increasingly challenging investment landscape.\n\nTrying to move the markets with a finger proved to be challenging. (Photo by Wance Paleri on Unsplash)\n\nAsk your average Mom-and-Pop investor as to the role that cryptocurrencies play in a standard investment portfolio and the likely answer is \u201cnone.\u201d\n\nGiven how complex and volatile cryptocurrencies are, it would be entirely expected if traditional investors were to shun the digital asset class as \u201cuninvestable.\u201d\n\nYet a recent Bitwise / ETF Trends survey of financial advisers, found that 16% had allocated cryptocurrencies to client portfolios in 2021, up 9% from 2020 and more Mom-and-Pop as well as professional investors are getting in on the action.\n\nPart of the reason for this increase in cryptocurrency allocations has of course been the rising availability of options.\n\nUnlike in 2018, there are more regulated pathways to invest in cryptocurrencies than at any time in the past \u2014 from opening a basic cryptocurrency trading account at listed exchanges such as Coinbase Global, to simply tacking on to a Robinhood Markets account.\n\nAnd somewhat ironically, there are more ways for retail investors to participate in cryptocurrencies than there are for institutional investors, who need to contend with oftentimes conservative and restrictive mandates and are limited to regulated vehicles, whereas retail investors can deal with loosely-regulated exchanges and self-service decentralized forums.\n\nLast year, a slew of Bitcoin-linked ETFs hit the market and saw record inflows \u2014 the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF raised a record US$1 billion in just 2 days of listing.\n\nThat demand for cryptocurrency products in a hard institutional shells has been so great that some of Wall Street\u2019s most storied names are throwing their hat in the ring.\n\nRecently, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, the US$10 trillion BlackRock and brokerage Charles Schwab filed to register funds that track the cryptocurrency economy, while other providers continue to lobby regulators to approve more products.\n\nWhat are we betting on?\n\nTrying to guess where cryptocurrencies will head next is akin to having predicted the path of the internet in the early 1990s \u2014 there are strong parallels, but many unknown unknowns.\n\nIn 1998, American economist Paul Krugman infamously noted,\n\n\u201cThe growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in \u2018Metcalfe\u2019s law\u2019 \u2014 which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants \u2014 becomes apparent \u2014 most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet\u2019s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAlthough Krugman\u2019s observations about the internet have not aged well, it also reflects the difficulty in predicting the future when it comes to new technology.\n\nBearing in mind, when Krugman made his forecast on the future of the internet, the few people who were online had at best a dial-up internet connection and few companies (in particular Sears) saw the merit in an online presence.\n\nFast forward to our current epoch, and even JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon once declared that, \u201ccryptocurrency has no intrinsic value\u201d finds his bank not only has a presence in the Metaverse, but has his portrait hanging on the walls of his literally, digital bank branch.\n\nWhile the internet represented a new way to distribute information that could have major consequences, moving from that early observation to predicting one day people would use smartphones to rent out a stranger\u2019s house instead of staying at a hotel is a different leap altogether.\n\nWhich is why so many investors and analysts will inevitably get it wrong on cryptocurrencies, especially the seasoned and scholarly ones.\n\nRifling Through the Couch Cushions for Investments\n\nIn a week that has seen both stocks and bonds routed as the U.S. Federal Reserve doubled down on its inflation-fighting rhetoric, spooking markets that are now preparing for a 50 basis-point rate hike in May, investors are clamoring for cover in an investment landscape that appears to be providing limited respite.\n\nAnd while investors may be lamenting the 2.8% hit to the S&P 500 this past week, that damage remains but a flesh wound when held up to measures of valuation \u2014 a sign that more losses could be on the cards.\n\nAt 22-times earnings and just shy of 3 times sales, the S&P 500 is still valued at a whopping 60% more than U.S. gross domestic product, higher than at any point in time before the pandemic.\n\nNot helping matters, central banks are aggressively raising interest rates, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is jacking up commodity prices and the return of the coronavirus to China may shutter the world\u2019s factory.\n\nLast week, the sharp selloff in bonds took so-called 10-year real yields, U.S. Treasury yields with inflation stripped out, into positive territory for the first time since 2020 \u2014 which sent riskier assets from all corners of the investing world plummeting.\n\nAll of which has forced investors to search for alternatives outside of the stock and bond markets.\n\nCommodities appear attractive, given their soaring prices, but they will be the first to suffer should supply issues be ironed out and inflation kept in check by soaring interest rates.\n\nAnd contrary to popular belief, the bulk of movement in commodity prices is driven by traders speculating on the direction of the market, rather than purely demand-driven price pressures, which do not make for strong long-term fundamentals.\n\nFloating rates of private credit and yields from public fixed income look tempting as well, but the best deals are often beyond the reach of retail investors, as is venture capital and recession-related risks have already been baked into returns.\n\nReal estate is sensitive to interest rate hikes and should wages not keep up with inflation, serve as a potential headwind for a sector that has only seen prices go up since the 2008 Financial Crisis.\n\nEmerging market assets look alluring as the dollar strengthens, but geopolitics are raising risks and reducing liquidity as the world becomes increasingly polarized.\n\nSo where does that leave investors?\n\nVirtually every other asset class has well-established valuation matrices and long histories with deep data troves for analysis.\n\nCryptocurrencies and their attendant blockchains however, represent potential that the world has yet to fully understand or grasp making them ripe for both extremes of optimism and pessimism.\n\nTo dismiss cryptocurrencies as purely a technology play is to ignore the fact that they sit at the nexus of finance, technology, game theory, behavioral economics and monetary systems \u2014 portable power.\n\nThe same way the internet had limited value when it consisted of just a handful of terminals connected over the ARPANET, when Bitcoin was being transferred between a clutch of early adopters, 10,000 Bitcoin could only be exchanged for two pizzas at Papa Johns.\n\nToday, Bitcoin serves as legal tender alongside the dollar in El Salvador and Mexico is mulling a similar move.\n\nWhen Western sanctions were leveled against Russia for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, ordinary Russians looking to protect the value of their assets sent ruble-crypto trading pairs soaring overnight, with between 8 to 16 times the typical volume.\n\nAnd when Ukraine desperately needed financial and military aid to combat the invaders, a portion of that aid came in the form of cryptocurrency donations, requiring no financial intermediary to effect the assistance to buy everything from flak jackets to ammunition.\n\nIn 2018, few (if any) governments took the threat of cryptocurrencies seriously, whether as a challenge to the supremacy of fiat currencies or as a means by which to circumvent taxation and sanctions.\n\nFast forward to our present time and the Biden administration is actively moving towards developing a comprehensive policy approach to cryptocurrencies and the European Central Bank is mulling the issuance of its own digital currency, while China has already had one for some time.\n\nWhereas the internet needed advances in the actual hardware that was necessary to advance the disruptive and transformative effect of the World Wide Web as we know it today, cryptocurrencies are solving hard problems with software solutions meaning that their development and application expansion will be faster (no fiber optic cables to lay down here).\n\nTake the allegation that cryptocurrency mining is a wasteful use of electricity for instance \u2014 later this year, the world\u2019s second most valuable blockchain by market cap, Ethereum, will be attempting a significant shift from the energy-intensive proof-of-work method to secure the blockchain to a far more energy- efficient proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nOther blockchains such as Solana, Cardano and Algorand already utilize proof-of-stake, although they\u2019re not as popular or as widely used as Ethereum.\n\nUnlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies don\u2019t lend themselves well to typical valuation metrics, because it\u2019s not possible to value a blockchain on the basis of profits or sales.\n\nYet cryptocurrencies themselves can have far more value than equity in many ways, as they allow stakeholders to have a vote that can determine the development of their respective blockchains, including on matters such as fees and distribution plans.\n\nImagine if a minority stake in Apple enabled shareholders to have a meaningful say in the company\u2019s privacy policies or the remuneration of its top executives \u2014 while ordinary stock can\u2019t necessarily facilitate such actions, cryptocurrencies can enable and empower the exercise of such rights.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to take for granted our current ability to transfer vast amounts of information across the internet today, not so long ago, this would have been the stuff of science fiction.\n\nNow imagine if our economic lives could be borderless as well \u2014 if we could transfer value whenever we needed to whoever needed it, execute a contract without ever having met our counterparty, and effect a trade without ever going through a broker.\n\nBecause we\u2019re only just beginning to explore what\u2019s possible with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain is also why they\u2019re so difficult to value.\n\nMarkets Know the Price of Everything But the Value of Nothing\n\nGiven how any meaningful engagement with cryptocurrencies is multidisciplinary, converging expertise in computer science, behavioral economics and financial services, predicting their transformative value and development potential is not a simple task, let alone price discovery.\n\nAnd that\u2019s also the reason why cryptocurrencies are so often simultaneously under and overvalued.\n\nBy most traditional measures, Bitcoin, and the rest of the US$2 trillion cryptocurrency sector should have crashed by now, that they haven\u2019t isn\u2019t necessarily testimony to their resilience, but the lack of leverage lingering in the cryptocurrency markets at this moment.\n\nRaising interest rates to combat inflation also means that the risk-free rate of return rises, and so more investors won\u2019t necessarily be as desperate for yield, which makes risk assets, including cryptocurrencies less attractive \u2014 or so goes the argument.\n\nWhile leverage is prevalent with traditional financial assets, it has actually decreased in recent months when it\u2019s come to cryptocurrencies \u2014 too many traders got burned in the great crypto deleveraging episodes throughout 2021.\n\nBut because Bitcoin is now increasingly viewed by professional investors as a component of the speculative class, it is not immune to central bank hawkishness and even though other cryptocurrencies bring different value propositions to Bitcoin, can\u2019t rise against a receding tide.\n\nGiven the myriad challenges facing asset markets, nothing is doing well.\n\nFrom the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to central bank policy tightening, China\u2019s insistence on zero-Covid lockdowns and soaring inflation \u2014 regardless of the asset concerned, there is some reason to be bearish.\n\nTech stocks have been hammered while bond yields have soared (yields rise inversely to bond prices).\n\nCrude oil stumbled on concerns over Chinese demand while gold, typically regarded as a inflation haven asset, fell as yields soared \u2014 the precious metal after all is a non-yielding asset and if investors believe that central banks will keep raising rates to combat inflation, there\u2019s little incentive to justify holding on to the precious metal.\n\nAgainst this bearish backdrop, investors need to ask themselves which assets will fair well when our current troubles are eventually resolved.\n\nAnd while there\u2019s no guarantee that cryptocurrencies will be that asset to plug forward \u2014 there are at least enough reasons that will become apparent with the benefit of hindsight.",

            "text": "\u00a9 Reuters. How Much Bitcoin Should You Hold in Your Investment Portfolio? The Answer Might Surprise You\n\nOf all the investment asset classes out there today, none is as controversial as cryptocurrency. Professional and retail investors alike have sparred over how much of an investment portfolio should be allocated to crypto, if any at all.\n\nNonetheless, the trend towards retail and institutional adoption of crypto has marched on, spurred by its enticingly high returns, promises of decentralized financial systems, and increasing use cases.\n\nWith the price of the dominant cryptocurrency by market cap, (CRYPTO:BTC), hovering around the $40,000 support level over the last few weeks, many investors may be considering establishing a position. The question now is, how much of your portfolio should be in Bitcoin?\n\nWhat the smart money says Some investors are die-hard crypto bulls, with anywhere from 25% to 100% of their portfolios in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Others fear the asset altogether, preferring to stick to traditional stocks and index funds. Fortunately, Bitcoin can be held in moderation. It\u2019s not all or nothing.\n\nAccording to a study by Yale University economist Aleh Tsyvinski, investment portfolios should have anywhere from a 1% to 6% Bitcoin allocation for diversification purposes \u2014 1% if you\u2019re pessimistic, 3-4% if you\u2019re neutral, and +6% if you\u2019re optimistic.\n\nThe reason behind this is that Bitcoin has a decently low correlation to other asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, golds, and commodities \u2014 that is, when those assets zig, Bitcoin tends to zag.\n\nThis, coupled with its high volatility, gives it a pretty good diversification benefit when added to a portfolio. By adding Bitcoin, we limit our exposure to any single asset and its risk.\n\nCouple this with its potential for seriously high returns, and what you have is a great asset to add for improving your portfolio\u2019s overall risk-return profile. For example, in the last five years, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index returned a great 155%. Bitcoin absolutely trounced this with a 2,804% return.\n\nHow do I buy Bitcoin? The best way to hold Bitcoin as part of your investment portfolio is to buy it on an exchange and then transfer it to cold storage. Traditionally, Canadian investors bought Bitcoin on coin exchanges, such as Binance, Shakepay, Newton, or Wealthsimple Crypto. Then you can transfer it to your \u201ccold wallet\u201d via your \u201cprivate key\u201d to keep it safe.\n\nCanadian investors can also buy Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their TFSAs or RRSPs. These ETFs hold the underlying Bitcoin in offline cold storage with a custodian and divvy it up into shares, which are bought and sold on the stock market during normal trading hours.\n\nThe first approach allows you to actually own your own Bitcoin (the saying \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d applies here), but you are taxed when you sell. You also have to exercise a high degree of responsibility to safeguard your cold wallet and private key as to not lose your Bitcoin.\n\nThe second approach allows you to sell Bitcoin tax free or tax deferred, as you can now buy it in a TFSA or RRSP. However, you don\u2019t physically own the Bitcoin \u2014 just shares of a fund tracking it. These funds also charge a management expense ratio of around 1% per year, which will cost you.\n\nThe Foolish takeaway Ultimately, the question of whether or not you should add Bitcoin to your investment portfolio depends on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Investors who \u201cHODL\u201d Bitcoin for a sufficient length of time to ride out the volatility almost always enjoy juicy returns, especially when halving cycles hit. However, not many can stomach the roller coaster of gains and losses Bitcoin experiences on a daily basis, let alone over weeks. As with all risky assets, properly assessing your investment objectives is a must.\n\nThe post How Much Bitcoin Should You Hold in Your Investment Portfolio?

By adding Bitcoin, we limit our exposure to any single asset and its risk.\n\nCouple this with its potential for seriously high returns, and what you have is a great asset to add for improving your portfolio\u2019s overall risk-return profile. For example, in the last five years, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index returned a great 155%. Bitcoin absolutely trounced this with a 2,804% return.\n\nHow do I buy Bitcoin?\n\nThe best way to hold Bitcoin as part of your investment portfolio is to buy it on an exchange and then transfer it to cold storage. Traditionally, Canadian investors bought Bitcoin on coin exchanges, such as Binance, Shakepay, Newton, or Wealthsimple Crypto. Then you can transfer it to your \u201ccold wallet\u201d via your \u201cprivate key\u201d to keep it safe.\n\nCanadian investors can also buy Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their TFSAs or RRSPs. These ETFs hold the underlying Bitcoin in offline cold storage with a custodian and divvy it up into shares, which are bought and sold on the stock market during normal trading hours.\n\nThe first approach allows you to actually own your own Bitcoin (the saying \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d applies here), but you are taxed when you sell. You also have to exercise a high degree of responsibility to safeguard your cold wallet and private key as to not lose your Bitcoin.\n\nThe second approach allows you to sell Bitcoin tax free or tax deferred, as you can now buy it in a TFSA or RRSP. However, you don\u2019t physically own the Bitcoin \u2014 just shares of a fund tracking it. These funds also charge a management expense ratio of around 1% per year, which will cost you.\n\nThe Foolish takeaway\n\nUltimately, the question of whether or not you should add Bitcoin to your investment portfolio depends on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Investors who \u201cHODL\u201d Bitcoin for a sufficient length of time to ride out the volatility almost always enjoy juicy returns, especially when halving cycles hit. However, not many can stomach the roller coaster of gains and losses Bitcoin experiences on a daily basis, let alone over weeks. As with all risky assets, properly assessing your investment objectives is a must.",

            "channel": "entrepreneur.com",
            "text": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for financial products (lending, trading, savings etc.) that don\u2019t require a centralized institution like a bank or exchange broker. Instead, they run on smart contracts, which are automatically executed when certain conditions are met. Users transact directly with each other and maintain control over their assets.\n\nFirst DeFi apps appeared around 2017, but it was in 2020-2021 that the market really exploded, reaching a valuation of $100B. Apps like Compound, Curve and Uniswap handle billions in volume.\n\nNevertheless, the DeFi industry is facing some formidable challenges. Perhaps the biggest is connecting fiat (traditional currencies, like USD) and crypto. The general consensus is that DeFi can and should foster the coexistence of both fiat and crypto - but how? This guide explores the most promising solutions.\n\nProviding Bank Lending Services for Both Crypto and Fiat\n\nRelated: Decentralized Finance Is on the Rise. What You Need to Know in 2021\n\nDeFi can generate a synergy of crypto and fiat by integrating traditional currencies in decentralized financial products. After all, fiat-based banking systems have been the lifeblood of the global economy for as long as there HAS been a global economy. Banking services such as easy lending contribute vastly to the sustainability of the financial sector globally and to the citizens who rely on loans in their daily lives.\n\nDeFi can unite the crypto and fiat worlds by providing similar lending and banking services using BOTH types of currencies in tandem. Examples include Compound, MELD and Aave. Most of these platforms offer loans in crypto and also in fiat, backed by an existing stake, or the converse. By doing this, a DeFi network crypto holders with faster access to standard fiat assets without losing or diluting their existing crypto stake.\n\nAlready, there are multiple DeFi networks providing lending services using both fiat and crypto. Offering cash loans by using crypto as collateral is a good way of fostering this type of old and new currency coexistence.\n\nAllow Fiat Backing in Stablecoins\n\nRelated: The Path to Stability: How Stablecoins Can Drive Borderless Business Across Europe\n\nAnother promising way to allow the coexistence of crypto and DeFi is by leveraging the concept of stablecoins. Stablecoins are simply a class of crypto assets backed by another asset such as Gold, commodities or fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar.\n\nHowever, it is vital that more upcoming DeFi projects provide similar stablecoin services to allow for the coexistence of both crypto and fiat in the financial sector. As stablecoins increase, so will their users, resulting in faster crypto adoption.\n\nLending Fiat Liquidity\n\nAnother way for DeFi projects to help ensure coexistence between crypto and fiat is by allowing fiat liquidity pools. A fiat liquidity provider offers its fiat assets to a lending pool - their fiat assets are then used to give other people loans.\n\nOne of the existing platforms providing fiat liquidity options is the MELD Protocol. The network will allow investors and institutions to offer fiat liquidity by using the MELD app on mobile, desktop or Web. In the process, the investors will earn yields in high APYs. On top of lending fiat liquidity, this platform will also allow investors to use their line of credit, thus making crypto assets even more liquid.\n\nAllow Investors to Earn Income with Fiat and Crypto\n\nRelated: Build New Wealth by Circumventing Old Money\n\nSavings accounts remain one of the most popular banking products, though falling interest rates and rising inflation mean that real yields on such accounts are zero or even sub-zero. DeFi projects offer similar savings products but provide higher earnings. DeFi yield farming is an excellent example: users lock up crypto tokens and get rewarded with more tokens daily, with nominal APYs often above 100%.\n\nDeFi projects often require other investors to deposit their assets in a liquidity pool (savings account equivalent). The asset is then lent to someone else who offers another asset as collateral.\n\nWhen lending cash, DeFi projects will often create a liquidity pool for depositing cash, with the cash then offered to others who collateralize crypto in return. However, in this case, the individuals depositing fiat will earn rewards in interest after the loan repayment.\n\nIncreasing Ease of Exchanging Crypto and Fiat\n\nRelated: Here's How You Can Tap into DeFi to Maximize Profitability\n\nProviding better liquidity of crypto tokens is another way for the Defi space to co-exist with both crypto and fiat. Already, there are many crypto exchanges today offering liquidity for assets - however, it takes a lot of time to change the tokens back into cash with most of them. They are not highly-liquid by default.\n\nHowever, DeFi projects can help streamline the issue. There are many ways through which this can be accomplished.\n\nExpert Ken Olling, noted several options: \u201cOne is by providing the option to purchase crypto directly with bank accounts or other fiat options. Decentralized exchange platforms, for instance, can make it easy for investors to buy crypto using credit cards. By doing that, there will be ease in converting fiat to crypto.\n\nSecondly, DeFi projects can provide instant cash access for those holding DeFi assets. The lending platforms can give crypto investors a line of credit. Moreover, Defi projects can link with banking institutions and other money changers. The result will provide more ease towards exchanging crypto to fiat and vice versa.\u201d\n\nFinal Word\n\nThis guide has been exploring how DeFi can provide coexistence between crypto and fiat. There is a high need to ensure a good link between fiat and crypto for the two to co-exist. DeFi has already been playing a major role in linking fiat and crypto-assets.\n\nDeFi networks provide essential services such as lending and yield farming, all of which can provide space for fiats. In lending, DeFi projects allow people to access fiat loans by using crypto as collateral. By doing that, they provide a pool for investors to offer fiat liquidity. There is no question that DeFi is a powerful new tool in the financial market to bring more money to more people in a safe, liquid and disruptive fashion.",

But with Bitcoin becoming a buzzword, I often wondered if I was missing a trick. So when Metro.co.uk offered to pair me up with crypto guru Patrick Reid in a bid to see if a complete novice could learn the ropes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nBefore our first Zoom meeting, I recalled the feeling of sitting at the back of Mrs Barry\u2019s class again at Hazelwick School in Crawley and not knowing my times tables. Would I really be able to do this?\n\nHowever, as I began to chat to Patrick, it was clear he knew his stuff. A highly successful trader, he\u2019s also co-founder of The Adamis Principle, a niche FX [foreign exchange] consultancy full of financial market whizzes.\n\nHe promised to walk me through everything gently, and it\u2019s just as well. Among the higher grades I got, scraping a \u2018C\u2019 at GCSE Maths has to be one of my greatest achievements \u2013 so bracing myself for the Bitcoin market was somewhat intimidating \u2013 no scrap that, terrifying.\n\nWhat even was a bit coin? A shiny platinum penny they sent you in the post after you\u2019d bought some stock?\n\nTurns out that a Bitcoin is a digital currency which operates free of any central control or the oversight of banks or governments.\n\nPatrick suggested that I invest a small amount initially \u2013 roughly between \u00a350 and \u00a3500 \u2013 but to start thriftly and increase in my own time as my \u2018talent\u2019 for the market grew.\n\nUsing the money app Revolut \u2013 which allows you to invest and was pretty easy to follow, thank god \u2013 Patrick showed me a chart that looks like a dodgy heartbeat. This was it; this was the market \u2013 and I was going to try and get my head round it. He started off slowly with some explanations \u2013 which surprisingly, I managed to follow.\n\nCan anyone learn to trade in cryptocurrency? Journalist and publisher Sally Windsor decided to find out with the help of finance guru Patrick Reid (Picture: Supplied)\n\nSo Stage One was pattern recognition. We looked at what the market did and how well it did it. This meant looking at where the peaks were on the chart and where the lows were too. I could recognise which bits went up and down \u2013 achievement number one. I knew the difference between up and down. It was a shaky start, but I was determined to get my head around this stuff.\n\nDown the right-hand side ran all the amounts of where the market was priced at. Five digit numbers mainly starting with a \u20184\u2019\u2026 something, something.\n\nFrom there, based on previous price action \u2013 we made a bias as to what it could do next. How on earth did I know what would happen next? Patrick insisted that all you had to do was watch and go with your gut.\n\nPatrick also told me about mid-Bollinger bands \u2013 a type of statistical chart characterising the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or commodity, using a formulaic method propounded by John Bollinger in the 1980s. I shocked myself with understanding them.\n\nThe purpose of Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low prices of a market. By definition, prices are high at the upper band and low at the lower band.\n\nStage Two was the risk, reward and execution. Before we pulled the buy trigger for a Bitcoin purchase, we looked at the potential reward and made sure it was more than what we could have lost.\n\nI was prepared for a loss, I mean \u2013 beginners\u2019 luck wasn\u2019t something I particularly believe in. You make your own luck in my world. But I couldn\u2019t help but hope that fortune would smile on me.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t help but hope that fortune would smile on me\u2019: Sally begins her trading journey (Picture: Sally Windsor)\n\nI decided to invest \u00a350 to text the waters, with a view to putting more in and pushing the button on the app was like a dopamine hit. Great fun and full of excitement. My friend Steve likened it to gambling, and I saw his point. With an addictive personality, you could get easily hooked this stuff\u2026 and I have that in abundance.\n\n\u2018All the press coverage on how you can get-rich-quick is nonsense,\u2019 Steve also said. Many others take this stance and would never consider investing. Perhaps risk is just too anxiety-provoking. Why would we choose to put ourselves through that? I did wonder.\n\nStage Three was managing the trade. We had done the hard work and now we manage the the trade we\u2019d done. Had it gone our favour and do we take profit? Or has it gone against us and do we ease out of the trade? The risk was exactly at this point and a little nerve-wracking. I checked my Revolut account, then checked it again.\n\n\u2018Managing risk is the key for success,\u2019 Patrick said and I trusted his vast experience.\n\nIt was at our third meeting that Patrick imparted his most famous words of wisdom on me.\n\n\u2018If we plan the trade and trade the plan \u2013 the outcome does not really matter because it is just noise,\u2019 he said. \u2018The hardest part of trading is sitting on your hands.\u2019 I felt it, the wait was kind of infuriating.\n\n\u2018When asked why I got into the game, most traders say they wanted to make money,\u2019 Patrick told me. \u2018But in my experience \u2013 the really successful ones do it for the passion.\u2019 And Patrick was testament to this.\n\nFinally, Stage Four was closure and learning to be better next time. Two weeks after first meeting Patrick, we decided to sell my Bitcoin. The market was up a touch from the amount I bought at and it felt like a good time to do it. I sold my Bitcoin via Revolut, making \u00a320 profit, which felt quite exciting.\n\nMy first trade was complete. Take that, GCSE Maths.\n\nTake that, GCSE Maths (Picture: Sally Windsor)\n\nPatrick and I were at peace with the outcome and did everything we could.\n\nSometimes the market has its own ideas which do not run with ours. That is absolutely fine because I have already moved onto my next trade, knowing it is just one of a thousand ahead of us.\n\nFrom knowing nothing about Bitcoin, after a months\u2019 tuition I\u2019m on the road to making some decent cash. I mean, I\u2019m not about to buy my friends and I the week-long spa break we all deserve, but everyone starts somewhere.\n\nPatrick has told me I was the ideal student, who took instruction and acted appropriately. I\u2019m proud of my new skill.\n\nI\u2019ll continue trading, and yes \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll catch the bug. But in today\u2019s society, if there\u2019s a way to help yourself along this bumpy road, shouldn\u2019t we be embracing it wholeheartedly?\n\nBitcoin is similar to life itself. It has its ups and downs, but you pull through it and go with the flow. Who knew cryptocurrency could be likened to spirituality? Perhaps it was a bit of karma and luck that came my way after all.\n\nMORE : Climate groups urge Bitcoin to change coding to cut energy consumption by 99%\n\nMORE : Jack Dorsey sets up \u2018legal defence fund\u2019 to protect Bitcoin developers",

            "text": "NFTs took the world by storm in 2021, bringing forth a digital art revolution while becoming one of the fastest growing asset classes of the year.\n\nThe technology of non-fungible tokens has enabled artists to offer digital originals without relying on middlemen, all while being able to receive royalties on secondary sales of their work. But, as Visual Capitalist's Niccolo Conte and Athul Alexander detail below, this use-case is just the beginning of the functionality non-fungible tokens bring to the blossoming world of web 3.0.\n\nThis following infographic by NFT.com showcases the evolving utility of NFTs, and how they are already building communities, enabling unique and tradeable game assets, and laying the foundations for ownership and identity in the metaverse.\n\nHow NFTs are Revolutionizing Digital Ownership Today\n\nNFTs provide a complete history and proof of ownership for digital assets or any other asset that is represented by a non-fungible token. This functionality enables the creation of unique digital assets and items that anyone can buy or sell freely on an open marketplace.\n\nToday NFTs have already evolved to provide further utility across a variety of industries:\n\nKeys to digital communities\n\nTradeable game assets\n\nOwnership of your username and assets in the metaverse\n\nAs the online world shifts from web 2.0 to web 3.0, NFTs are building the foundations of digital communities, economies, and assets.\n\n1. NFTs as Keys to Online Communities and Events\n\nOne of the first evolutions in NFT use-cases came in the form of using non-fungible tokens as \u201cmembership passes\u201d to a digital community. Ownership of NFT profile picture collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) naturally became linchpins around which communities of holders formed.\n\nToday, profile picture NFT collections like Oni Ronin have built on this idea, providing access to exclusive workshops and ceremonies, free airdrops of other NFTs, and prize raffles for holders of the Oni Ronin NFT collection.\n\nAlong with access to online communities and events, NFTs have been used to provide exclusive access to in-person events. Since NFTs provide immutable proof of ownership on the blockchain, the technology is primed to solve large issues in the world of event ticketing like forging and digital theft.\n\n2. Productive and Exchangeable Game Assets\n\nGaming is one of the key sectors where NFTs have been providing utility for players by enabling ownership of purchased in-game assets. Projects like DeFi Kingdoms on the Harmony blockchain have NFTs \u201cheroes\u201d, that players can buy, sell, and rent out on an open market.\n\nAlong with providing ownership for the in-game asset, these NFTs are also productive assets, and can be sent on quests where they earn in-game items and cryptocurrency for the player. These items can be exchanged for cryptocurrency, or used to craft other items to power up heroes.\n\nThe integration of NFTs into blockchain games like DeFi Kingdoms, Axie Infinity, and Crabada has created vibrant in-game economies where NFTs are valued based on their attributes and statistics that dictate the amount of cryptocurrency they earn. Playtime is rewarded in these games, as levelling up NFT assets results in increased earnings and higher chances of rare and valuable item drops.\n\n3. Redefining Digital Identities and Assets\n\nWorried about someone taking your username in the metaverse? NFTs have already enabled ownership of custom \u201c.eth\u201d Ethereum wallet addresses through Ethereum Name Service (ENS), with more than 671,000 unique \u201c.eth\u201d addresses registered so far.\n\nAs an NFT, these custom addresses are integrated in other decentralized applications and simplify previously complex wallet addresses to be personalized and much easier to remember.\n\nRather than a long string of numbers and letters like \u201c0x0079784df055a06EC5A76A90b24\u201d, ENS allows for much simpler wallet addresses like \u201cvisualcapitalist.eth\u201d.\n\nOther projects like NFT.com are using NFTs to provide users with custom ownership of a personal profile like \u201cwww.nft.com/yourname\u201d, where users can show and share their NFTs on a decentralized social network.\n\nEnabling Ownership in the Metaverse Economy\n\nAlong with usernames and wallet addresses, non-fungible tokens are becoming the foundational technology for assets in the metaverse. Metaverse project, The Sandbox, is already using NFTs to represent digital land, items like furniture and decor for virtual spaces, and much more.\n\nIn March of 2022, The Sandbox generated more than $24 million in sales of NFTs representing metaverse real estate, with top brands and celebrities across sectors like Atari, Snoop Dogg, and the South China Morning Post all owning plots of digital land.\n\nNFTs have only just begun to revolutionize the ownership and exchange of digital assets, and are laying the foundations for digital communities, tradeable in-game assets, and the economy of the metaverse.\n\n* * *\n\nNFT.com is building the decentralized social network of the NFT world, governed and owned by the community.",

            "text": "Jo\u00e3o Marinotti, Associate Professor of Law, the Indiana University.\n\n______\n\nIn 2021, an investment firm bought 2,000 acres of real estate for about USD 4m. Normally this would not make headlines, but in this case the land was virtual. It existed only in a metaverse platform called The Sandbox. By buying 792 non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, the firm then owned the equivalent of 1,200 city blocks.\n\nBut did it? It turns out that legal ownership in the metaverse is not that simple.\n\nThe prevailing but legally problematic narrative among crypto enthusiasts is that NFTs allow true ownership of digital items in the metaverse for two reasons: decentralization and interoperability. These two technological features have led some to claim that tokens provide indisputable proof of ownership, which can be used across various metaverse apps, environments, and games. Because of this decentralization, some also claim that buying and selling virtual items can be done on the blockchain itself for whatever price you want, without any person or any company\u2019s permission.\n\nDespite these claims, the legal status of virtual \u201cowners\u201d is significantly more complicated. In fact, the current ownership of metaverse assets is not governed by property law at all, but rather by contract law. As a legal scholar who studies property law, tech policy, and legal ownership, I believe that what many companies are calling \u201cownership\u201d in the metaverse is not the same as ownership in the physical world, and consumers are at risk of being swindled.\n\nPurchasing in the metaverse\n\nWhen you buy an item in the metaverse, your purchase is recorded in a transaction on a blockchain, which is a digital ledger under nobody\u2019s control and in which transaction records cannot be deleted or altered. Your purchase assigns you ownership of an NFT, which is simply a unique string of bits. You store the NFT in a crypto wallet that only you can open, and which you \u201ccarry\u201d with you wherever you go in the metaverse. Each NFT is linked to a particular virtual item.\n\nIt is easy to think that because your NFT is in your crypto wallet, no one can take your NFT-backed virtual apartment, outfit, or magic wand away from you without access to your wallet\u2019s private key. Because of this, many people think that the NFT and the digital item are one and the same. Even experts conflate NFTs with their respective digital goods, noting that because NFTs are personal property, they allow you to own digital goods in a virtual world.\n\nHowever, when you join a metaverse platform you must first agree to the platform\u2019s terms of service, terms of use, or end-user license agreement. These are legally binding documents that define the rights and duties of the users and the metaverse platform. Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, almost no one actually reads the terms of service. In one study, only 1.7% of users found and questioned a \u201cchild assignment clause\u201d embedded in a terms of service document. Everyone else unwittingly gave away their first-born child to the fictional online service provider.\n\nIt is in these lengthy and sometimes incomprehensible documents where metaverse platforms spell out the legal nuances of virtual ownership. Unlike the blockchain itself, the terms of service for each metaverse platform are centralized and are under the complete control of a single company. This is extremely problematic for legal ownership.\n\nInteroperability and portability are defining features of the metaverse, meaning you should be able to carry your non-real-estate virtual property \u2013 your avatar, your digital art, your magic wand \u2013 from one virtual world to another. But today\u2019s virtual worlds are not connected to one another, and there is nothing in an NFT itself that labels it as, say, a magic wand. As it stands, each platform needs to link NFTs to its own proprietary digital assets.\n\nVirtual fine print\n\nUnder the terms of service, the NFTs purchased and the digital goods received are almost never one and the same. NFTs exist on the blockchain. The land, goods and characters in the metaverse, on the other hand, exist on private servers running proprietary code with secured, inaccessible databases.\n\nThis means that all visual and functional aspects of digital assets \u2013 the very features that give them any value \u2013 are not on the blockchain at all. These features are completely controlled by the private metaverse platforms and are subject to their unilateral control.\n\nBecause of their terms of service, platforms can even legally delete or give your items away by delinking the digital assets from their original NFT identification codes. Ultimately, even though you may own the NFT that came with your digital purchase, you do not legally own or possess the digital assets themselves. Instead, the platforms merely grant you access to the digital assets and only for the length of time they want.\n\nFor example, on one day you might own a USD 200,000 digital painting for your apartment in the metaverse, and the next day you may find yourself banned from the metaverse platform, and your painting, which was originally stored in its proprietary databases, deleted. Strictly speaking, you would still own the NFT on the blockchain with its original identification code, but it is now functionally useless and financially worthless.\n\nWhile admittedly jarring, this is not a far-fetched scenario. It might not be a wise business move for the platform company, but there\u2019s nothing in the law to prevent it. Under the terms of use and premium NFT terms of use governing the USD 4 million\u2019s worth of virtual real estate purchased on The Sandbox, the metaverse company \u2013 like many other NFT and metaverse platforms \u2013 reserves the right at its sole discretion to terminate your ability to use or even access your purchased digital assets.\n\nIf The Sandbox \u201creasonably believes\u201d you engaged in any of the platform\u2019s prohibited activities, which require subjective judgments about whether you interfered with others\u2019 \u201cenjoyment\u201d of the platform, it may immediately suspend or terminate your user account and delete your NFT\u2019s images and descriptions from its platform. It can do this without any notice or liability to you.\n\nIn fact, The Sandbox even claims the right in these cases to immediately confiscate any NFTs it deems you acquired as a result of the prohibited activities. How it would successfully confiscate blockchain-based NFTs is a technological mystery, but this raises further questions about the validity of what it calls virtual ownership.\n\nThe Conversation reached out to The Sandbox for comment but did not receive a response.\n\nLegally binding\n\nAs if these clauses weren\u2019t alarming enough, many metaverse platforms reserve the right to amend their terms of service at any time with little to no actual notice. This means that users would need to constantly refresh and reread the terms to ensure they do not engage in any recently banned behavior that could result in the deletion of their \u201cpurchased\u201d assets or even their entire accounts.\n\n[Over 150,000 readers rely on The Conversation\u2019s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.]\n\nTechnology alone will not pave the way for true ownership of digital assets in the metaverse. NFTs cannot bypass the centralized control that metaverse platforms currently have and will continue to have under their contractual terms of service. Ultimately, legal reform alongside technological innovation is needed before the metaverse can mature into what it promises to become.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This means that users would need to constantly refresh and reread the terms to ensure they do not engage in any recently banned behavior that could result in the deletion of their \u201cpurchased\u201d assets or even their entire accounts.\n\n[Over 150,000 readers rely on The Conversation\u2019s newsletters to understand the world.

NFTs cannot bypass the centralized control that metaverse platforms currently have and will continue to have under their contractual terms of service. Ultimately, legal reform alongside technological innovation is needed before the metaverse can mature into what it promises to become.\n\nThis article by Jo\u00e3o Marinotti, Associate Professor of Law, Indiana University, is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "text": "We are excited to bring Transform 2022 back in-person July 19 and virtually July 20 - 28. Join AI and data leaders for insightful talks and exciting networking opportunities. Register today!\n\nEarlier this year a chilling academic study was published by researchers at Lancaster University and UC Berkeley. Using a sophisticated form of AI known as a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) they created artificial human faces (i.e. photorealistic fakes) and showed these fakes to hundreds of human subjects along with a mix of real faces. They discovered that this type of AI technology has become so effective, we humans can no longer tell the difference between real people and virtual people (or \u201cveeple\u201d as I call them).\n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t their most frightening finding.\n\nYou see, they also asked their test subjects to rate the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d of each face and discovered that consumers find AI-generated faces to be significantly more trustworthy than real faces. As I describe in a recent academic paper, this result makes it extremely likely that advertisers will extensively use AI-generated people in place of human actors and models. That\u2019s because working with virtual people will be cheaper and faster, and if they\u2019re also perceived as more trustworthy, they\u2019ll be more persuasive too.\n\nThis is a troubling direction for print and video ads, but it\u2019s downright terrifying when we look to the new forms of advertising that the metaverse will soon unleash. As consumers spend more time in virtual and augmented worlds, digital advertising will transform from simple images and videos to AI-driven virtual people that engage us in promotional conversation.\n\nArmed with an expansive database of personal information about our behaviors and interests, these \u201cAI-driven conversational agents\u201d will be profoundly effective advocates for whatever messaging a third party is paying them to deliver. And if this technology is not regulated, these AI agents will even track our emotions in real time, monitoring our facial expressions and vocal inflections so they can adapt their conversational strategy (i.e. their sales pitch) to maximize their persuasive impact.\n\nWhile this points to a somewhat dystopian metaverse, these AI-driven promotional avatars would be a legitimate use of virtual people. But what about the fraudulent uses?\n\nThis brings me to the topic of identity theft.\n\nIn a recent Microsoft blog post by Executive VP Charlie Bell, he states that in the metaverse fraud and phishing attacks could \u201ccome from a familiar face \u2014 literally \u2014 like an avatar that impersonates your coworker.\u201d I completely agree. In fact, I worry that the ability to hijack or duplicate avatars could destabilize our sense of identity, leaving us perpetually unsure if the people we\u2019re talking to are the individuals we know or quality fakes.\n\nAccurately replicating the look and sound of a person in the metaverse is often referred to as creating a \u201cdigital twin.\u201d Earlier this year, Jensen Haung, the CEO of NVIDIA gave a keynote address using a cartoonish digital twin. He stated that the fidelity will rapidly advance in the coming years as well as the ability for AI engines to autonomously control your avatar so you can be in multiple places at once. Yes, digital twins are coming.\n\nWhich is why we need to prepare for what I call \u201cevil twins\u201d \u2013 accurate virtual replicas of the look, sound, and mannerisms of you (or people you know and trust) that are used against you for fraudulent purposes. This form of identity theft will happen in the metaverse, as it\u2019s a straightforward amalgamation of current technologies developed for deep-fakes, voice emulation, digital-twinning, and AI driven avatars.\n\nAnd the swindlers may get quite elaborate. According to Bell, bad actors could lure you into a fake virtual bank, complete with a fraudulent teller that asks you for your information. Or fraudsters bent on corporate espionage could invite you into a fake meeting in a conference room that looks just like the virtual conference room you always use. From there, you will give up confidential information to unknown third parties without even realizing it.\n\nPersonally, I suspect imposters will not need to get this elaborate. After all, encountering a familiar face that looks, sounds, and acts like a person you know is a powerful tool by itself. This means that metaverse platforms need equally powerful authentication technologies that validate whether we\u2019re interacting with an actual person (or their authorized twin) and not an evil twin that was fraudulently deployed to deceive us. If platforms do not address this issue early on, the metaverse could collapse under an avalanche of deception and identity theft.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking forward to the metaverse or not, major platforms are headed our way. And because the technologies of virtual reality and augmented reality are designed to fool the senses, these platforms will skillfully blur the boundaries between the real and the fabricated. When used by bad actors, such capabilities will get dangerous fast. This is why it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest, consumers and corporations alike, to push for tight security. The alternative will be a metaverse filled with rampant fraud, a consequence it may never recover from.\n\nLouis Rosenberg, PhD is CEO of Unanimous AI and a pioneer in the fields of VR, AR, and AI.",

With over 90% of employees choosing iOS devices, IT was required to provide support for journalists and photographers in remote field locations as often as office staff at their headquarters.\n\nAt the time of deployment, National Geographic needed to manage over 1,000 macOS and 550 iOS devices, with scalability capacity for the installation of Apple TVs across the entire organization. Previous multi-platform tools were better suited to manage PCs, falling short with Apple management requirements.\n\nPost-implementation, the organization enjoys management flexibility and trusted security with all of their Apple devices.\n\n\u201cWith Jamf Pro, our journalists and employees spend less time worrying about technology and more time focusing on our mission of inspiring people to care about the planet,\u201d says Jehan Aziz, Apple service manager, National Geographic.\n\nNational Geographic selected Jamf Pro based on the following criteria:\n\nIt gives journalists and employees the Apple devices they want, with the tools they need to be productive\n\nIt allows for the installation of all new Apple OS releases, with timing determined by the users\n\nEmployees are able to patch software when and where they need to\n\nIt offers administrative tools for customizable configurations, profiles, and settings\n\nJamf Pro ensures devices are encrypted, securing sensitive information\n\nIT staff can provide remote wipe capabilities for lost or stolen devices\n\nJamf Pro is backed by the Jamf community and support team\n\nThere are several other examples of how companies are using the functionality provided by Jamf Pro:\n\nSAP uses Jamf Pro to manage over 24,000 Macs, 16,000 iPads, 67,000 iPhones, and 230 Apple TVs\n\nGOAT , a platform for buying classic and rare sneakers , is using Jamf Pro to manage over 1,000 macOS and iOS devices\n\nThe European luxury brand Rituals uses Jamf Pro for their 650 MacBooks, 700 iPads, 650 iPhones, and 1,500 iPod devices\n\nOxford University uses Jamf Pro to manage their inventory of Apple devices\n\nDifferentiators\n\nFor enterprises looking to scale as needed, without the headaches that come from maintaining the requisite infrastructure, look to the optional Jamf Pro MDM servers in the cloud \u2014 including disaster recovery, daily backups with 30-day retention, service monitoring, and 99% server uptime guaranteed.\n\nWith the aim to support the growing number of employees that work from home and work remotely, Jamf added BYOD support to Jamf Pro. Given the need to separate personal data from corporate data and ensure preservation of each user\u2019s privacy, this functionality only allows IT to manage corporate information. By eliminating the need to buy additional, redundant, devices for employees, the cost savings are immediate.\n\nTo provide further support to clients, Jamf has a considerable library of white papers that introduce topics such as \u201cApple Admin Scripting for Beginners,\u201d \u201cSingle Sign-On and Authentication for Beginners,\u201d \u201cSteps to Complete Microsoft Enterprise Compliance,\u201d and \u201cEssential 8 Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents.\u201d These materials elevate Jamf to being advisers.\n\nUser reviews\n\nReviews for Jamf Pro are consistently high, with praise often given for their support options, including having active online communities.\n\nPricing\n\nSubscription plans for Jamf Pro are available with two configurations, billed annually:\n\n$3.33 per device per month for iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS\n\n$7.17 per device per month for macOS\n\nAll subscriptions include workflows to automate deployment and management, access and flexibility to customize macOS scripts, and an on-demand portal to reduce help tickets.\n\nConclusions\n\nJamf Pro delivers on their promise of centralized management of Apple devices without compromising on features or functionality.\n\nAutomating common IT tasks like deployment and software updates will reduce the number of service tickets and support requests, reducing costs and keeping users happier.\n\nIn addition, value-added features like personalizing content and custom branding allow users to identify with, trust, and rely on the MDM solution.",

Over 28,000 organizations leverage Mosyle solutions to automate the deployment, management and security of millions of Apple devices daily. Request a FREE account today and discover how you can put your Apple fleet on auto-pilot at a price point that is hard to believe.\n\nThere\u2019s a concept of building from first principles that can create some pretty incredible products. For example, one of the technologies I\u2019ve long thought was more complicated than it should be is VPN. VPNs came further into the spotlight with remote work and employees needing to access company resources from wherever they are. I recently came across a product that works great on macOS that takes that first-principles approach to how VPN connections work, and it\u2019s called Tailscale.\n\nAbout Apple @ Work: Bradley Chambers managed an enterprise IT network from 2009 to 2021. Through his experience deploying and managing firewalls, switches, a mobile device management system, enterprise grade Wi-Fi, 100s of Macs, and 100s of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple IT managers deploy Apple devices, build networks to support them, train users, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for IT departments.\n\nVPN setup is clunky at best. Different firewalls require different setups, and it can sometimes be challenging to get the proper devices to the correct servers depending on the subnet, IP scheme, etc. By implementing Tailscale, it\u2019s easy to connect to another network by using a stable IP address for each device (server, laptop, etc.). These addresses stay the same, no matter where nodes move to in the physical world the devices are located. Each device gets an IP in the 100.X range, and it\u2019s assigned based on the device and the Tailscale login.\n\nUsing Tailscale with macOS\n\nI\u2019ve got a fairly simple use case with Tailscale for personal use. I want to access my Umbrel server (learn how to build one in my past guide) remotely as well as my Plex server. Umbrel has a Tailscale app in its App Store, so the setup was painless. I can now access it from anywhere. It\u2019s running on my Umbrel server and my Plex server, so when I want to connect to those servers directly, I just enable Tailscale on my Mac, and I can connect to those devices.\n\nWhat problem does this solve in the enterprise?\n\nTailscale is built on top of WireGuard. WireGuard is a fast encrypted networking protocol that offers a number of performance benefits over typical VPNs. Tailscale adds to WireGuard by adding automatic mesh configuration, single sign-on support, 2-multi-factor authentication, NAT traversal, and centralized Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nSo let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got employees spread out around the country (or world), and you want to securely let them access secure company resources like internal servers over VPN while letting public internet traffic run locally. TailScale works this way out of the box. It runs as an overlay network and only routes traffic between devices running Tailscale but doesn\u2019t touch traffic not aimed at a Tailscale device. With this default setup, you can leave Tailscale running at all times on macOS or iOS without sending all your traffic through them.\n\nTo sum it up, Tailscale is an affordable VPN that requires no configuration, installs on any device in a few seconds, handles firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere. While my use case is 100% personal, you can see the benefits it could bring to enterprises everywhere. Tailscale is truly a VPN for the remote-work world. It\u2019s one of those rare solutions that \u201cjust works.\u201d Pricing starts at free for one user with up to 20 devices, and paid plans start at $5/month (paid annually). So, if you\u2019re struggling to roll out VPN access to your entire company in a way that\u2019s not stretching your team with troubleshooting, check out Tailscale. Its VPN so simple, I am not sure Apple or Google could have made it any easier. It works great on macOS and iPhone and iPad.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

            "text": "Tech gets old. It\u2019s a fact of life. All you can do is make plans to replace an obsolete product before it\u2019s too late.\n\nAnd obviously the best way to start your planning process is to know exactly when a device will become obsolete. Thankfully, when it comes to Beats products, that\u2019s pretty easy to figure out. Here\u2019s a complete rundown of which Beats products are officially obsolete according to Apple, and which ones will become obsolete soon.\n\nWhich Beats devices are obsolete?\n\nApple has a list of obsolete Beats products on its website with a basic explanation for how device obsolescence works. Apple service providers will offer customer support for a product for at least five years after Apple last manufactured said product. Once an Apple product is obsolete, the company won\u2019t help you with any repairs or other services after that. By then, you should probably think about upgrading.\n\nFortunately for you, Beats owner, the list of obsolete Beats devices is pretty short:\n\nBeatbox Portable (1st generation)\n\nBeatbox Portable (3rd generation)\n\nBeatbox Portable 2\n\nBeats Pill 1.0\n\nBeats Pill XL 1\n\nIf you own any of those and need repairs, you better seek someone other than Apple. Sorry to say your Beats device is lost in the wilderness of tech obsolescence. However, just because your Beats device isn\u2019t on that list doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re totally in the clear.\n\nWhich Beats devices will be obsolete soon?\n\nApple has another layer to its obsolescence program where some devices are officially designated \u201cVintage.\u201d A device is vintage if Apple stopped selling it more than five years ago, but less than seven years ago. In that two-year window, you may still be able to get repairs or parts from Apple, but that\u2019s subject to parts availability.\n\nOh, and this only applies in the United States. In the rest of the world, vintage Beats devices are fully obsolete instead. Here are the vintage Beats devices in the U.S.:\n\nBeatbox Portable (2nd generation)\n\nBeats Executive\n\nBeats Mixr 1\n\nBeats Pill 2.0\n\nPowerbeats (1st generation)\n\nPowerbeats 2\n\nPowerbeats Wireless 2\n\nBeats Solo HD\n\nBeats Solo2 Wireless\n\nBeats Studio (2nd generation)\n\nBeats Tour (2nd generation)\n\nBeats Tour 2.5\n\nBeats Wireless (1.5)\n\nIf you own any of those products, you\u2019re safe for a bit, but heading towards uncharted waters. It\u2019s probably best to chart a new course by upgrading to a newer model.",

There are many business credit cards on the market, many of which offer excellent travel benefits. When crafting this list of the best business airline credit cards, we aimed to find a variety of cards so that no matter which major airline you fly, there's a card for you. Additionally, we looked for cards that had plenty of travel perks that businesses want without too many downsides. We paid attention to factors like signup bonuses, spending rewards, interest rates, annual fees and travel perks.\n\nWhich one is the best airline credit card for your business? One of the biggest questions to ask yourself when looking for the right airline credit card for your business is: How do you normally travel? If you usually fly with a specific airline and want to maximize the benefits, then choose the card that corresponds to your airline of choice. If you travel often but want the flexibility to fly with any airline, then the Chase Ink Business Preferred card is probably right for you.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a business airline credit card? Airline credit cards allow you to earn miles that you can later redeem for flights. They also come with additional travel perks such as free checked bags, access to airport lounges, priority boarding and TSA PreCheck.\n\nWhat credit score do you need for an airline credit card? Airline business credit cards typically require good or excellent credit scores. If your business doesn't have sufficient credit, but you do, then you may be able to guarantee the card with your personal credit.",

Reserved for individuals with great credit who can afford to spend more than the average household, high-end cards offer perks that make you feel like a VIP.\n\nThe most exclusive credit cards come with a high credit limit (if any) and personalized service. Some were created for personal use, while others are business or corporate cards. Regardless of the top-tier card you're considering, you'll find that exceptional service comes with a steep annual fee. Fortunately, the perks and bonuses available usually offset the fee, potentially making it worth your while to invest in one of these cards.\n\nSome of the more exclusive cards are invitation-only, however, making them highly-coveted. While we can't get you on the list for the most exclusive ones, we can at least show you what's available.\n\nAmerican Express Centurion\u00ae Card Card Highlights Intro Bonus N/A APRN/A Recommended Credit N/A Reward Rates 1.5x points on all purchases of more than $5,000\n\nEarn 1 Membership Rewards point per dollar spent Annual FeeN/A Intro Purchase APRN/A Rewards & Redemption Details 1.5x points on all purchases of more than $5,000\n\nEarn 1 Membership Rewards point per dollar spent The most exclusive credit card of all, it's known among credit card enthusiasts as \"The Black Card.\" You may have seen this card in music videos or flashed by certain celebrities. It's only available to a very small club of individuals who reportedly spend at least $250,000 per year. The Centurion\u00ae card has an air of mystery around it \u2014 there's not much public information about its perks or features. However, the stories of what Black Card concierges are willing to do for their customers have become legend. One former employee shared on Reddit that customer service will fulfill any request as long as it's legal. One thing that's not a myth is the $10,000 initiation fee, in addition to the annual fee of $5,000. Pros Elite status for several airlines and hotels\n\nThe ultimate in prestige when paying for goods and services\n\nPersonal concierge Cons Very high annual fee\n\n$10,000 initiation fee\n\nInvitation-only\n\nMastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122 Card Highlights Intro Bonus N/A APR15.24% Variable Recommended Credit Excellent/Good Credit Reward Rates 2% Value for Airfare Redemptions\n\n1.5% Value for Cash Back Redemptions\n\nEarn one point for every one dollar spent.

If you haven't received an invitation to apply for the Centurion\u00ae Card by American Express, you're among the majority. There's not much you could do to get on the list, but you could apply for another exclusive black card: the Mastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122. The card feels substantial, thanks to its patented PVD-coated metal card in sleek black. And there's substance behind the style; you'll have access to a 24/7 Luxury Card Concierge by email, live mobile chat, or phone. The card's annual fee of $495, which is relatively affordable compared to the American Express version, is outweighed by its benefits. Each time you book one of over 3,000 properties, you'll receive room upgrades, resort credits, breakfast for two guests, and more. Plus, you'll be enrolled in Priority Pass\u2122 Select. The membership provides you with access to over 1,300 airport lounges around the world for as many guests as you want. Pros: Online application available\n\nHigher than average rewards rates\n\nLuxurious card design\n\nCell phone protection of up to $1,000 per year\n\nFree access to airport lounges worldwide Cons: Comparatively-low credit limit\n\nNo welcome bonuses\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae Card Card Highlights Intro Bonus Earn 50,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. That's $750 toward travel when you redeem through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae APR17.24% - 24.24% Variable Recommended Credit Excellent Credit Reward Rates Earn 10x total points on hotels and car rentals when you purchase travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae.\n\nEarn 5x total points on air travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae\n\nEarn 3x points on other travel and dining.\n\n1 point per $1 spent on all other purchases Annual Fee$550 Intro Purchase APRN/A Additional Details Balance Transfer Fee Either $5 or 5% of the amount of each balance transfer, whichever is greater Balance Transfer APR17.24% - 24.24% Variable Foreign Transaction Fees $0 Penalty APR Up to 29.99% Rewards & Redemption Details Earn 10x total points on hotels and car rentals when you purchase travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae.\n\nEarn 5x total points on air travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae\n\nEarn 3x points on other travel and dining.\n\n1 point per $1 spent on all other purchases If you're a frequent traveler in search of an elite credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae is among the best. Only available to applicants with excellent credit scores, it's an exclusive card for travel aficionados in search of high rewards for travel and dining spending. Although the annual fee for the card is $550 per year, Chase provides you with travel-purchase credits worth as much as $300 each year. Add the Visa Infinite Concierge service and free access to over one thousand airport lounges, and you'll feel like a VIP anytime you travel. Pros Travel credits and other benefits offset the $550 annual fee\n\nLucrative bonus offer of 50,000 points\n\nHigh rewards rates of up to 10X\n\nExclusive Chase Sapphire Private Dining Series events Cons Requires excellent credit\n\nFocused solely on travel rewards\n\nJ.P. Morgan Reserve\u00ae card Card Highlights Intro Bonus N/A APRN/A Recommended Credit Excellent Credit Reward Rates 5x total points on flights\n\n10x total points on hotels\n\n10x total points on dining purchases through Chase Dining(SM) Annual FeeN/A Intro Purchase APRN/A Rewards & Redemption Details 5x total points on flights\n\n10x total points on hotels\n\n10x total points on dining purchases through Chase Dining(SM) Another premium card by Chase, the J.P. Morgan Reserve\u00ae card is the financial institution's invitation-only card for J.P. Morgan Private Bank clients who have at least $10 million in assets held. Made of real Palladium, the physical card may be the rarest of the top five reviewed. Surprisingly, many of the card's features are the same you'd find if you had the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Carrying the J.P. Morgan Reserve card, however, signals to anyone who knows about cards that the holder is worth at least $10 million. The sleek, metal card may not have the pop-culture following of the Centurion Card by American Express, but it's just as exclusive -- if not more so. Pros: Sleek, palladium-metal card\n\nLucrative bonus offer of 60,000 points after spending $4,000\n\nComes with a 50% travel redemption bonus Cons: Invitation-only\n\nApplicants must have at least $10 million in assets held with J.P. Morgan Private Bank\n\nHow did we choose these cards? We compared features, fees, level of service, credit limits, and sign-up bonuses to narrow the list down to five cards. Credit limits are not often disclosed by the card issuers, so we searched the web to find cardholder comments and reviews to determine the range. Not all credit cards are available to apply for unless you receive an invitation or referral by an existing cardmember. They're still worth mentioning, since this guide is all about the most exclusive credit cards on the market right now.\n\nWhich card is the right one for me? The five most exclusive credit cards are each designed for a specific individual. If you have at least $10 million in a J.P. Morgan Private Banking account, you may receive an invitation to apply. If you don't have the level of cash required but you have excellent credit, the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Mastercard Black Card both offer an online application to anyone interested in getting a card. One thing all five cards have in common is that they're right for individuals who are accustomed to spending large amounts annually using their credit cards.\n\nHow can I improve my odds of getting accepted for one of these exclusive cards? There's a reason the cards reviewed are considered exclusive. Three out of the five cards are invitation-only, and the other two are cards for individuals with excellent credit. If you're wondering what to do about getting invited to apply for a card like the Black Card, there are preparatory steps you can take to improve your chances: 1. Work on your credit score: Most premium cards require a credit score of 800 or more for approval. 2. Establish a banking relationship beforehand: Some cardholders may have established a pre-existing banking or card relationship. This method could help you network more effectively and improve your chances of getting approved for an upgraded premium card. For example, you could open a bank account with Chase before you apply for the Reserve card or have a different card account with American Express, leading to an invitation to upgrade to a higher-tier credit card. 3. Ask for a referral: If someone you know has a Stratus Reserve card or another invitation-only or referral-based credit card, they may be able to refer you. This improves the odds that you'll be able to apply for a card. 4. Grow your annual income: Nearly all premier credit cards require a high annual income to be considered.\n\nBottom line The top most exclusive credit cards come with unique benefits, such as concierge service and increased rewards rates. However, watch out for the high annual fee. Unless you use the card and its perks regularly, you may not be able to recoup the annual expense.\n\n\n\nAre there premium card alternatives worth considering? For the ultimate in exclusivity, the products mentioned are the top picks. However, three out of five are invitation-only. For the bulk of individuals who may never see a Black Card invitation to apply, there are alternatives such as the Platinum Card\u00ae by American Express or the Black Mastercard mentioned.\n\nWhat are some premium features of a top-tier credit card? A personal concierge may be the most common perk or feature you'll find in an exclusive, high-end credit card. Personal concierges are well-connected to book you a difficult-to-get reservation, find tickets to a sold-out concert, etc. Besides concierge service, premium card perks include free hotel, flight, and car-rental upgrades and free access to airport lounges.\n\n\n\n",

Commerzbank has over 18 million customers and around 70,000 institutional clients.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with local media outlet B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung, Bernd Reh, a senior spokesman for the bank, said the application is part of the banking giant\u2019s ambition to pursue its digital assets strategy.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we are pursuing our own digital asset strategy and are also planning our own offerings for our customers in the coming years.

The bank also has a storied history with blockchain technology, going back to 2018 when it carried out one of the first transactions on Deutsche Boerse\u2019s DLT Security Lending Platform.\n\nThe banking behemoth is, however, not the first firm to apply for the license with BaFin. Since Germany passed legislation to allow financial service providers to apply for licenses to provide digital currency services in 2020, it has received over 25 applications. However, BaFin has approved only four of the applications, with the first being Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) Germany\u2019s filing.\n\nGermany acting friendly with virtual assets\n\nAt the time the legislation was passed, Germany\u2019s central bank stated that it did not consider digital currencies to be a threat despite their growing popularity. The conviction the government has in the potential of digital assets continues to propel its policies to date.\n\nThis year, Germany\u2019s incoming government has stated that it is fully committed to digitalizing Europe\u2019s largest economy. It aims to greatly improve digital currency regulations for the industry to create a level playing field for market participants across Europe.\n\nThe previous and ongoing efforts of the German government have culminated in the country emerging as the most digital asset-friendly country in 2022, as ranked by Coincub.

            "text": "EUR/USD: Words Drive Trends\n\nThe main drivers of the past week were statements by important ECB and FRS officials. However, the beginning of the five-day period was relatively calm: the Easter weekend had its effect. Unlike the United States, Europe rested not only on Friday April 15, but also on Monday 18. The dollar was slightly supported on Monday by the comments from the representatives of the American regulator. According to Rafael Bostic, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the base interest rate may be about 1.75% by the end of 2022, and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans believes that it will reach 2.25-2.50%. And the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, James Bullard, announced a possible rise in the key rate by 0.75% immediately at the May meeting of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee).\n\nThe situation changed dramatically on Tuesday: the EUR/USD pair reversed and, having soared by 175 points, reached the height of 1.0935 on Thursday, April 21. It was not the dollar but the euro that was supported this time by hawkish comments from the members of the European Central Bank Governing Council. Thus, the head of the Central Bank of Latvia, Martins Kazaks, said on Wednesday that an increase in the ECB rate is possible as early as July. His colleague, the head of the National Bank of Belgium, Pierre Wunsch, gave an interview to Bloomberg the next day, in which he noted that interest rates could become positive this year. ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos confirmed this possibility, according to him the quantitative easing (QE) program may be completed in July, after which the path to raising rates will be open.\n\nAn additional impetus to the pair was given by the improvement in risk sentiment and the decline in the yield of American Treasuries. This sent the DXY dollar index down 1% after hitting a two-year high on Tuesday.\n\nThe situation changed for the third time on Thursday afternoon. The dollar went on a new offensive, assisted by a rise in the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds, which rose to 2.974%, the highest level since December 2018. This happened thanks to Jerome Powell. Speaking at a meeting within the framework of the International Monetary Fund spring session, the head of the Fed confirmed the high probability of raising the interest rate by 0.5% at the next FOMC meeting on May 3-4. Such a move is under consideration, Powell said, as the U.S. job market is already \u201coverheated.\u201d He did not rule out either that the rate could be increased by another 0.5% in June.\n\nAs for the head of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, speaking at the same IMF event, she refused to comment on the likelihood of an increase in the euro rate in July. \u201cThis will depend on the economic performance,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said vaguely, after which the EUR/USD pair flew down.\n\nThe head of the ECB decided to slightly tighten her position on the last day of the working session, April 22. \u042bhe did not deny at this point that the European Central Bank\u2019s purchase program could end at the beginning of Q3 and added that interest rates could rise as early as 2022. Her words sounded more hawkish compared to Thursday\u2019s, but that didn\u2019t help the euro. The pair found its bottom only at 1.0770, after which there was a slight correction to the north and a finish at 1.0800.\n\nThe euro was slightly supported by the results of the televised debate between French President Emmanuel Macron and opposition leader Marine Le Pen. As the poll data showed, 56% of respondents considered that the incumbent president was more convincing in the debate than his rival.\n\nThe second round of the presidential elections in France will be held on Sunday 24 April. Emmanuel Macron won 27.84% of the vote in the first round. Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally Party, received 23.15%. Recall that she belongs to the Eurosceptics, and had called for almost the exit of the country from the Eurozone back in 2017. And if this lady comes to power, the EUR/USD pair, according to a number of analysts, may fall to the level of 1.0500, or even lower.\n\nAt the time of writing the review, the results of the election are still unknown, so the majority of analysts (50%) did not make any forecasts. 35% believe that the dollar will continue to strengthen. The opposite opinion is shared by only 15%. All trend indicators and oscillators on D1 are colored red, although 15% of the latter give signals that the pair is oversold. The nearest support is located at the level of 1.0770. The next EUR/USD bear target will be the April 14 low at 1.0757. And if they manage to break through this support, they will then aim for the 2020 low of 1.0635 and the 2016 low of 1.0325. Immediate resistance zone is 1.0830-1.0860, followed by 1.0900, the April 21 high of 1.0935 and 1.1000.\n\nAs for the release of macro data, the volume of orders for capital goods and durable goods in the US will be known on Tuesday, April 26. Data on GDP and the state of consumer markets in Germany and the Eurozone will be received on Thursday, April 28 and Friday, April 29. In addition, preliminary annual data on US GDP will be released on Thursday.\n\nGBP/USD: The Battle for 1.3000 Is Lost. Will there be a counterattack?\n\nWe assumed in the previous review that we are in for the continuation of the battle of bulls and bears, and the front line will pass in the zone of 1.3000. Recall that 1.3000 is a key support/resistance level as it is not only the March 15 low, but also the 2021-2022 low.\n\nAnd now we must say that the bulls have lost this battle. Having raised the GBP/USD pair to the height of 1.3090, they finally weakened, and it flew down. The local bottom was fixed at 1.2822 on Friday, and the final chord sounded a little higher, in the zone of 1.2830.\n\nThe reasons for this collapse of the pound lie on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. On the one hand, this is the hawkish position of the US Federal Reserve and the growth of US Treasury yields. On the other hand, there are cautious comments from the Bank of England (BoE) and weak macro statistics from the UK.\n\nCommenting on the state of the economy on Thursday, the head of the British regulator, Andrew Bailey, said that the inflationary shock in the United Kingdom has more in common with the Eurozone than with the US. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be complacent about inflation expectations,\u201d Bailey added, reiterating that they were dealing with \u201ca very tight line between fighting inflation and the impact of a shock on real incomes.\u201d\n\nThe day after the speech of the head of the Bank of England, the UK Office for National Statistics dealt another blow to the pound. It reported that retail sales fell 1.4% in March. This indicator followed the February decline of 0.5% and turned out to be much worse than the forecast, according to which the fall should have been only 0.3%.\n\nSuch a massive failure will most likely send investors into a shock and it will take time to restore their appetite for British currency purchases. The bears will try to build on their success and push the GBP/USD pair further down. 65% of analysts vote for this development, the remaining 35% expect the pair to correct to the north.\n\nThere is a total advantage of the red ones among the indicators on D1: 100% both among trend indicators and oscillators. True, as for the latter, a third is in the oversold zone. The immediate goal of the bears is to overcome the support of 1.2800, update the October 2020 lows around 1.2760 and open their way to the September 2020 lows in the zone 1.2685-1.2700. More distant targets for the pair\u2019s decline are located at the levels of 1.2400, 1.2250, 1.2085 and 1.2000. As for the bears, they will try to regain the initiative and fight again for 1.3000. However, they will need to overcome the resistances of 1.2860 and 1.2915 on this way. In case of a successful assault on 1.3000, resistance levels 1.3100, 1.3150 and the zone 1.3190-1.3215 will follow.\n\nThere are no significant data releases on the UK economy for the coming week. The only thing that can be noted is the release of data on the housing market of this country on Friday, April 29.\n\nUSD/JPY: Will the Bank of Japan Stand Its Ground?\n\nThe Japanese currency is hitting one anti-record after another, and the expectation that the past week would bring another one proved to be absolutely correct. The USD/JPY pair recorded another high at 129.39 on Wednesday, April 20. The last time it climbed this high was in May 2002, that is, 20 years ago.\n\nThe reasons for the fall of the yen are the same: divergence from the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve. Despite the fact that the majority of the Japanese are against the weak yen, the Bank of Japan still refuses to raise the key rate even to zero and does not want to cut monetary stimulus. The regulator believes that maintaining economic activity is much more important than fighting inflation.\n\nThe regular meeting of the Japanese Central Bank will take place next week, on Thursday, April 28. According to strategists of Singapore\u2019s UOB Group (United Overseas Bank), the regulator will once again leave the parameters of its monetary policy unchanged. \u201cWe are confident,\u201d write UOB economists, \u201cthat the BOJ will maintain its current loose monetary policy unchanged throughout 2022, and will also maintain massive stimulus, possibly until fiscal year 2023 at least.\u201d\n\nThe yen received some support from reports that Treasury Secretary Shunichi Suzuki discussed the idea of coordinated foreign exchange intervention with his counterpart, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. And it seems that \u201cthe American side sounded as if it would positively consider this idea.\u201d However, a source from the Japanese Ministry of Finance dampened hopes for a joint effort between the two countries, refusing to comment on the details of the conversation between Suzuki and Yellen.\n\nHaving renewed a multi-year high, the pair USD/JPY bounced back a little in the second half of the five-day period and ended it at the level of 128.53. 40% of experts vote for the bulls to storm new heights, 30% have taken the opposite position and 30% adhere to neutrality. Among indicators on D1, 100% of trend indicators look north, among oscillators, these are 90% of them (a third are in the overbought zone), the remaining 10% point south. The nearest support is located at 127.80-128.00, followed by 127.45, 126.30-126.75 zone and levels 126.00 and 125.00. The resistances are located at levels 128.70, 129.10 and 129.39. An attempt to designate the subsequent targets of the bulls will rather be like fortune telling. The only thing we can assume is that they will set a high of January 01, 2002, 135.19, as a distant target. Taking into account the fact that the pair has risen by 1400 points over the past 7 weeks, it can reach this height in a month and a half if this pace is maintained.\n\nAside from the BOJ meeting and its monetary policy report, there is no other important information on the state of the Japanese economy expected this week.\n\nCRYPTOCURRENCIES: BTC from $30,000 to $200,000\n\nThroughout 2022, bitcoin has been moving along the Pivot Point around $40,000, trying to either reach $50,000 or fall to $30,000. The reason for such fluctuations, of course, is the US Federal Reserve. Investors cannot finally decide how to behave in the face of tightening monetary policy and rising dollar interest rates. As a result, their appetite for risk falls and flares up again. First of all, this applies to the stock market, along with which digital gold fluctuates as well.\n\nWe have repeatedly considered the correlation of the BTC/USD pair with the shares of technology companies. So, according to Arcane Research, the correlation between bitcoin and the Nasdaq Composite index reached its high since July 2020. The same indicator between the first cryptocurrency and gold has fallen to a historic low. It is physical gold that has recently been acting as a hedge against inflation, and its price came close to its historical maximum, reaching $2.070 per ounce on March 08 (the maximum price of $2.075 was recorded on August 2, 2020).\n\nBitcoin-ETP (Exchange Traded Product) shows an outflow of funds. If the current pace is maintained, the historical anti-record of July 2021 will be updated by the end of the month, when investors withdrew 13,849 BTC. The number of active addresses on the bitcoin network has dropped to 15.6 million, about 30% less than the January 2021 high. Many short-term (less than 155 days) holders and speculators have already parted with their BTC holdings, according to Glassnode data.\n\nThe market is currently supported by long-term holders (LTH). As we already wrote, there has recently been a trend towards the accumulation of digital gold among them. The volumes of accumulation began to exceed emission many times over. According to Glassnode, the rate of outflow of coins from centralized platforms has increased to 96,200 BTC per month, which is extremely rare in historical retrospect. In addition to the \u201cwhales\u201d, the so-called \u201cshrimp\u201d (addresses with a balance of less than 1 BTC) also contributed to the accumulation, bringing their share to 14.26% of the market supply.\n\nAt the moment, about 15% of long-term holders are losing, but they not only continue to store coins, but also acquire new ones, counting on their growth in the future. For example, analytics software provider MicroStrategy intends to \u201cstrongly pursue\u201d its strategy and continue to build up reserves in bitcoin. This was stated by CEO Michael Saylor in a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy holds 129,218 BTC worth $5.17 billion in reserves. The company\u2019s division made its last purchase of $190.5 million in early April. For comparison, Tesla, which is in second place after MicroStrategy, owns 43,200 BTC worth about $1.7 billion.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Friday evening, April 22, the total crypto market capitalization is still below the important psychological level of $2 trillion, at $1.850 trillion ($1.880 trillion a week ago). The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slightly improved its readings: it rose from 22 to 26 points and returned from the Extreme Fear zone to the Fear zone.\n\nThe BTC/USD pair is trading around $39,700. The chart of the past four months, with its rising highs and lows, gives investors hope for a further rise in price. However, everything will depend on the May Fed meeting and investor risk sentiment. Recall that BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has predicted a drop in bitcoin to $30,000 by the end of the second quarter due to the decline in the Nasdaq index. The same figure of $30,000 is also mentioned by cryptocurrency analyst and trader Michael van de Poppe, although he points to another reason: geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe due to Russia\u2019s military invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMany other experts do not expect anything good from the BTC/USD pair in the near future either, although they build optimistic forecasts for the medium and long term. So, according to Anthony Trenchev, CEO of the Nexo crypto-landing platform, the price of the first cryptocurrency may rise above $100,000 over the next 12 months. However, he is \u201cworried\u201d about the short-term outlook for bitcoin. In his opinion, the rate may fall along with traditional stock markets as a result of the US Central Bank curtailing the monetary stimulus program.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex, predicts similar dynamics of the flagship cryptocurrency. This specialist believes that bitcoin will be \u201cmuch higher\u201d than $50,000 by the end of 2022. However, he admits a sharp drop in prices in the near future. \u201cAt the moment, we are living in conditions of, I would say, global uncertainty in the markets, not only cryptocurrencies, but also stock markets,\u201d Ardoino said.\n\nCryptocurrency market expert Ali Martinez analyzed the price chart of bitcoin and said that its value could fall to $27,000. It is important for the bulls to stay above the critical support level in order to prevent this from happening. According to the Fibonacci levels, this support is in the $38,530 area. If a breakdown occurs, then the rate of digital gold will fall to $32,853 or even $26,820. Like most analysts, Martinez also believes that one should not focus only on technical analysis and discard the fundamental one, since much depends on the geopolitical situation in the world now.\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is confident that bitcoin is approaching \u201cthe point of choosing the direction of the trend.\u201d Cowen elaborates that this has happened before: \u201cIn 2013, bitcoin made a low, then a second, then a third, and eventually began to rise. And then in 2018, when there were higher lows, we thought that the same thing would happen as in 2013, but in the end, bitcoin fell to a new low.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, in order to restore the bullish trend and reduce the likelihood of a bearish one, the BTC/USD pair needs to rise above the 200-day SMA, which is at around $47,440 at the time of writing. \u201cIf bitcoin can muster the courage to rise above its 200-day SMA and move to the $50,000 level, then that would look pretty optimistic. But what happens if the market drops to $30,000 and then bitcoin goes up again? There\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get back to $40,000 or maybe $43,000,\u201d said Benjamin Cowen.\n\nMost likely, the prospect of the return of the flagship cryptocurrency from $30,000 back to $40,000 in the current situation will not please investors very much, since the coin is currently trading in the region of $40,000. Therefore, to cheer them up, we will quote another specialist, Nicholas Merten from DataDash, who believes that BTC can set new record highs as early as next year. According to him, the bulls still have not lost control despite the current market fluctuations: \u201cThe market is currently far from impressing investors, but this situation is always observed during the beginning of accumulation. This is how the structure of the trend begins to form.\u201d\n\nAccording to Merten, the fact that bitcoin has begun to make higher lows and higher highs confirms that the bulls are at the helm, no matter how things look at the moment. The analyst believes that since this situation persists, then the BTC rate has every chance of reaching $150,000 and even $200,000 within the next year.",

Furthermore, Polygon is pledging $100 million to early Supernet users \u201cwho can help fast-track adoption.\u201d The announcement details that Supernets is essentially the team\u2019s Polygon Edge network \u201con steroids.\u201d\n\nPolygon Supernets \u2014 Dedicated, Scalable Blockchains That Aim to Ignite Mass Adoption\n\nPolygon has revealed a new project called Supernets after launching Polygon Edge last year. Essentially, Polygon Edge is a customizable blockchain stack that allows users to launch dedicated blockchain networks that do specific things. Following the Edge launch 11 months ago, the team has revealed Polygon Supernets, a project powered by Edge with fewer complexities. While Supernets still uses Edge, the latest rollout offers \u201cseveral important characteristics\u201d that mitigate complexities involved with Edge.\n\nSupernets basically allows developers to build custom networks without all the costs associated with servers. The Polygon team says Supernets are a dedicated solution, as \u201cevery Supernet is built and run for a specific application, project or use case,\u201d which gives users the advantage of \u201cdedicated Web3 hosting.\u201d The networks can also be secured using Polygon\u2019s native crypto asset MATIC. In order to increase awareness and adoption, Polygon has further revealed it is allocating $100 million to early Supernet users.\n\n\u201cSuper excited to introduce Polygon Supernets powered by Polygon Edge,\u201d the team tweeted on Friday. \u201cPolygon Supernets are dedicated, scalable blockchains that aim to ignite mass adoption of Polygon and Web3. To support this ambitious product and goal, we are announcing a $100M support fund.\u201d The team\u2019s Twitter thread mentioned that more than 20 projects \u201care already building on Edge\u201d and the Polygon team learned a lot from these teams. Polygon also shared five advantages of using Supernets which include:\n\nThey are dedicated;\n\nCan use MATIC PoS validators out-of-the-box;\n\nThey are interconnected;\n\nCan be managed/maintained by our Certified Partners;\n\nSupport any Edge architecture.\n\nPolygon Co-Founder Says Supernets Can \u2018Fast-Track Blockchain Ambitions\u2019\n\nPolygon has been making a lot of development and business moves over the last 12 months, and during the first week of February, the project raised $450 million from investors such as Sequoia Capital India, Softbank, and Shark Tank\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Leary. Last December, Polygon acquired the Mir Protocol for $400 million and that same month Polygon started a $200 million social media-based Web3 fund with \u200b\u200bAlexis Ohanian\u2019s Seven Seven Six venture capital.\n\nThis April, Polygon announced the launch of a zero-knowledge identity platform for Web3. According to Friday\u2019s Supernets announcement, the $100 million will be distributed for things like development contracts, research contracts, grants, third-party integrations and partnerships, onboarding and migration, liquidity mining, and acquisitions.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201dFor mass adoption of Web3 to take hold, it is critical to abstract the complexities of blockchain development and simultaneously offers scaling ability and personalization,\u201d Mihailo Bjelic, the co-founder of Polygon concluded in a statement. \u201cPolygon Supernets deliver all this, enabling any project to fast-track their blockchain ambitions and join the growing Polygon multi-chain ecosystem.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about Polygon Supernets?

The Opera Crypto Browser Project was built to simplify the Web3 user experience that has often been bewildering for mainstream users. Opera believes Web3 has to be easy to use in order to reach its full potential and a mass adoption.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what crypto support means:\n\n\u201cIn the Opera Crypto Browser Project, users gain access to an Integrated non-custodial Crypto Wallet supporting Ethereum, Polygon, and Celo blockchain ecosystems with more blockchain integration already on the roadmap. The browser\u2019s key features include a non-custodial crypto wallet with the ability to buy crypto with fiat, send, receive, and swap the tokens of any supported blockchain, as well as seamless and direct access to decentralized exchanges, Web3-based NFTs, and gaming Dapps \u2013 including over 7,000 Polygon-based services. Web3 can be accessed as seamlessly as accessing any website on Web2.\n\n\u201cThe browser on iOS also boasts the ability to restore any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible Wallet with the native Opera Wallet, allowing users to integrate their existing assets and balances into their Crypto Browser setup.\u201d\n\nOpera also mentioned that:\n\n\u201cThe browser was also designed to address crypto\u2019s growing pains. As Web3 is surging, users and developers increasingly look towards more efficient and environmentally-friendly PoS and Layer 2 chains which enable cheaper transactions and a much lower energy consumption than PoW blockchains. To address this, Opera has partnered with Polygon and will be integrating more PoS chains in the future. Polygon consumes just 0.00079 terawatts (TWh) of electricity per year \u2014 significantly less than the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain networks which average between 35 to 140 (TWh) per year.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

            "channel": "fool.com",
            "text": "Over very long periods of time, the stock market has stood on a pedestal above all other investing channels. Even though it won't outpace the returns of bonds, gold, or housing every year, the stock market offers a much higher average annual return over the long run.\n\nBut the short run is a completely different story. Since the pandemic bottom in March 2020, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies has rocketed from $141 billion to nearly $1.9 trillion. That's a gain of almost 1,240%, for those of you keeping score at home.\n\nWhile the \"blue-chips\" of crypto, Bitcoin and Ethereum, rightly get a lot of credit for this large nominal increase in market value, it's momentum-driven meme coin Shiba Inu ( SHIB -3.82% ) that's lured numerous new investors into the crypto arena over the past 15 months.\n\nThings couldn't have gone better for Shiba Inu last year\n\nLast year, Shiba Inu delivered what might be the single greatest annual return we'll ever witness. When the year began, a single SHIB token could be purchased for a minute $0.000000000073. If you're wondering why there are so many zeroes after the decimal point, keep in mind that the initial coin supply was set at 1 quadrillion. Between midnight on Jan. 1, 2021, and Oct. 27, 2021, when tokens hit an all-time intra-day high of $0.00008841, SHIB gained a jaw-dropping 121,000,000%! Even following a pullback to end last year, Shiba Inu increased by approximately 46,000,000%.\n\nGains of this magnitude are virtually unheard of. Thankfully for Shiba Inu and its investors, a couple of factors worked in its favor.\n\nFor example, visibility increased dramatically in 2021. Numerous cryptocurrency exchanges accepted SHIB for listing, which vastly improved its liquidity. Additionally, decentralized exchange ShibaSwap launched in July, further lifting liquidity and allowing investors to stake their coins to earn passive income. Since staking became popular late last year, the median hold time for SHIB on leading crypto exchange Coinbase Global has soared from six days to 115 days, as of April 18, 2022.\n\nAnother reason Shiba Inu was virtually unstoppable in 2021 is cryptocurrency trading dynamics. With publicly traded stocks, it's relatively easy for pessimists to sell shares short or purchase a derivative, such as a put option. In the cryptocurrency arena, it's a lot tougher for pessimists to bet against these assets. For instance, some cryptocurrency exchanges don't allow short-selling. Also, with the exception of Bitcoin, there are no derivative or future contracts for skeptics to buy. This created a natural buy bias that allowed social media-driven momentum to launch SHIB to the moon.\n\nCould Shiba Inu hit $1 in five years?\n\nHowever, Shiba Inu's faithful don't believe their beloved coin is done pushing higher. Despite being quite a ways away from even hitting a penny, calls for SHIB to hit $1 per token persist on social media.\n\nBased on Shiba Inu's per-coin price of $0.00002515 at the time of this writing, hitting $1 would represent a nearly 4,000,000% increase. Keep in mind that SHIB returned over 10 times that amount last year -- so nothing is impossible.\n\nBut in order to hit $1 per token in five years (by 2026), Shiba Inu would need to flawlessly execute on a slew of upcoming projects, innovations, and catalysts.\n\nAs an example, the launch of layer-2 blockchain project Shibarium needs to occur sooner than later, and work flawlessly once launched. Since Shiba Inu is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, it's exposed to the same high transaction fees and slow processing times that occasionally plague the popular Ethereum network. Shibarium's sole purpose is to substantially lower transaction fees, to make SHIB-based transactions more cost-effective and attractive.\n\nThe reason it's so important for developers to get Shibarium launched is that pretty much all future projects rely on low-cost transactions. For instance, Shiba Inu's developers have made no secret of their desire to launch non-fungible token (NFT)-based gaming, and sell digital plots of land, known as \"Shiba Lands,\" in their own metaverse. However, NFT marketplaces can't take shape until the high fees associated with each transaction come way down. Being a successful early player in the NFT gaming space could go a long way toward supporting a higher valuation.\n\nYet the biggest catalyst needed would likely be large coin burn events. Coin burn describes the process of sending tokens to dead blockchain addresses where they can no longer be accessed. Just as publicly traded companies repurchase their own common stock to make each remaining share that much more valuable, coin burn attempts to do the same within the crypto space.\n\nAdding more zeroes is the more likely outcome for Shiba Inu by 2026\n\nAlthough Shiba Inu is sitting on far more projects and catalysts than it was at this time last year, expecting everything to go flawlessly isn't consistent with how innovation works in the cryptocurrency arena. My belief is that it's more likely Shiba Inu will gain, not remove, additional zeroes after its decimal point by 2026.\n\nFundamentally speaking, a valuation of $1 per token without a massive coin burn event makes no sense. Based on an estimate of 549 trillion SHIB still in circulating supply, a $1 per coin price would give Shiba Inu a value ($549 trillion) that's more than five times global gross domestic product. For context, Apple is the largest publicly traded company in the U.S., with a market cap of $2.7 trillion.\n\nSomething else to consider is that Apple generated more than $112 billion in operating cash flow last year and leads by innovation. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is nothing more than a payment coin that's reliant on Ethereum's blockchain. Worse yet, it's not even a particularly useful payment coin. According to online business directory Cryptwerk, only 659 mostly obscure merchants worldwide are willing to accept SHIB as a form of payment.\n\nAs noted, reaching $1 would require a huge amount of coin burn. However, this seems virtually impossible given investors' desire to hang onto their coins, as well as the aforementioned minimal use case for SHIB. Although some businesses may be burning a small percentage of coins with each transaction, the number of tokens being sent to dead blockchain addresses is negligible compared to the estimated 549 trillion SHIB still in circulating supply.\n\nAnother issue is that Shiba Inu fails to stand out in an increasingly crowded space. While the launch of NFT-based gaming may help, it's worth pointing out that interest in NFTs has been waning significantly over the past couple of months.\n\nLastly, history would suggest a massive price reversion awaits Shiba Inu -- and is already underway. When I examined the performance of other payment coins and protocol tokens on payment networks that delivered life-altering short-term gains, I found that virtually all of them (Bitcoin was the exception) fell by 93% or more within the 26 months following their eventual peaks. With SHIB gaining 121,000,000% in less than 10 months last year, the alarm bells should be ringing for current and prospective investors.",

            "text": "The most important milestone for Ethereum ( ETH -2.51% ) since its 2015 launch is arguably on the way. The merge of the Beacon chain with the Ethereum mainnet was expected to take place in June of this year. However, that timeline will be pushed back -- probably by a month or two.\n\nEven with this latest delay, the merge is a big deal for Ethereum. But other popular digital tokens could be impacted, as well, including Shiba Inu ( SHIB -3.82% ). Could Shiba Inu skyrocket after the upcoming Ethereum merge?\n\nJoined at the hip\n\nWhy would Ethereum's merge impact Shiba Inu at all? There's a simple reason: The two are, in a sense, joined at the hip.\n\nShiba Inu is an ERC-20-compatible token built atop the Ethereum blockchain. It was created as an Ethereum-based alternative to Dogecoin.\n\nJust how tightly intertwined are Ethereum and Shiba Inu? Consider that purchases of virtual land in the Shiba Inu metaverse can only be made with ETH tokens and not with SHIB tokens.\n\nThe merge of the Beacon chain, which uses the proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, with the Ethereum mainnet will dramatically improve the blockchain's energy efficiency. That will be good news for Shiba Inu.\n\nMerge, shmerge\n\nWill the Ethereum merge serve as a huge catalyst for Shiba Inu? Don't count on it.\n\nThe anticipated merge is certainly an important phase in the overall Ethereum upgrade. However, it's not the final phase. The introduction of shard chains will come next, but not until 2023 (assuming there aren't any delays). This phase is the one that investors are really excited about, as it will significantly increase the Ethereum blockchain's capacity and slash transaction fees.\n\nIt's possible that the shard chains probably won't light a major fire beneath Shiba Inu's price either. Why? For one thing, SHIB is just one of more than 40 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies based on market cap that are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There's no reason to expect that Shiba Inu would benefit any more than any of these other rivals will from the Ethereum blockchain improvements.\n\nHowever, probably the strongest argument why none of the phases of the Ethereum upgrade (including the merge) will turbocharge Shiba Inu is the anticipated launch of Shibarium. This layer-2 solution is expected to usher in significantly lower transaction fees for trading SHIB tokens, regardless of what happens with the Ethereum upgrade.\n\nSure, there hasn't been a firm date set for when Shibarium will roll out. But it could happen as soon as this summer -- well before the launch of shard chains on the Ethereum blockchain (and possibly even before the Beacon chain merge).\n\nOther types of rocket fuel\n\nShiba Inu will need another type of rocket fuel to take off instead of the Ethereum merge. The Shibarium launch could fit the bill. And there are other potential catalysts on the way, as well.\n\nVersion 2.0 of the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange will feature a burn portal. The prospects of a sustained burning strategy for Shiba Inu has many investors excited. As SHIB tokens are burned and removed from circulation, the laws of supply and demand dictate that the price of the remaining tokens will move higher.\n\nThere's also much anticipation about the aforementioned Shiba Inu metaverse. Virtual land is already for sale in this metaverse. It's possible that the metaverse could expand the base of Shiba Inu holders in the future.\n\nShiba Inu should have several key milestones on the way. But the Ethereum merge probably won't be a big deal for the meme coin.",

            "text": "Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche (AVAX), which launched in 2020, is a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. Avalanche's mission is to provide a scalable blockchain solution while retaining decentralisation and security, emphasising low costs, rapid transaction speeds, and ecological sustainability.\n\nAvalanche was purposefully intended for scalability. As a result, avalanche's transaction timings are comparable to top-tier payment processors such as PayPal and VISA.\n\nAdditionally, Avalanche, which many see as a rival to Ethereum (ETH), outperforms Ethereum in terms of gas fees. This is because avalanche's fees are much less expensive than Ethereum's.\n\nAvalanche is powered by the native token AVAX, which is utilised for staking, governance, and payment services.\n\nAVAX was launched at $0.5 during its initial coin offering (ICO) and hit an all-time high of $146.22 on 21 November 2021, yielding approximately 29,144% gains for early investors. At the time of writing, the AVAX token is worth $77.08.\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nPolygon (MATIC), originally known as the Matic Network, is a scalability platform that seeks to give several tools for increasing transaction speed, lowering transaction costs, and simplifying transaction complexity on blockchain networks.\n\nPolygon advertises itself as a layer-2 network, which means it operates as an add-on layer to Ethereum that does not intend to alter the underlying blockchain.\n\nPolygon aims to aid Ethereum's growth in terms of scale, privacy, performance, and utility and encourage developers to bring more tempting products to market faster.\n\nMATIC is the Polygon Network's native coin. It is utilised as the unit of payment and settlement amongst network members.\n\nMATIC traded at $0.00263 during its initial coin offering (ICO) and reached an all-time high of $2.92 on 27 December 2021, equating to over 1,10,927% gains. The MATIC token is currently worth $1.42.\n\nQuitriam Finance (QTM): The Next Game-Changing Token?\n\nQuitriam Finance (QTM) is now in its presale phase and may generate significant returns once it begins trading on exchanges.\n\nQuitriam Finance is a launchpad for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a multi-chain automated market maker exchange, an incubator, and a yield farming platform.\n\nAccording to its white paper, it is a cryptocurrency exchange that aims to resolve the issues associated with order-matching centralised exchanges and trustless custody within existing decentralised exchanges through advanced machine learning and neural network algorithms.\n\nQTM holders will be able to access liquidity mining services through a one-click interface, with the exchange handling everything in the background.\n\nWhat Makes Quitrium Finance Unique?\n\nDecentralised finance (DeFi) was created to guarantee that retail consumers have simple financial assistance but concentrated in the hands of a few prominent players that wield undue influence. QTM protocol, with its ground-breaking technology, intends to alter this and empower every investor.\n\nQuitriam Finance's mission is to eliminate the bottlenecks in the decentralised exchange (DEX) market. At the moment, most decentralised exchanges impose enormous withdrawal costs for liquidity pool tokens, with users not receiving an entire portion of the fees.\n\nQuitriam Finance's decentralised exchange will enable quick swaps across multiple blockchain networks due to its compatibility with many other chains. The Polygon network will handle the almost \u2018fee-less\u2019 transactions.\n\nMoreover, since Quitriam Finance is a multichain network, it solves the issue that other Ethereum-based DEXs face. Users will be able to exchange tokens at a rate greater than 50,000 transactions per second for a fee of less than $0.00001 per transaction, enabling efficient and quick transactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nPresales are an excellent method to participate in the launch of new and successful cryptocurrencies. There are several benefits to investing in Quitrium Finance early on.\n\nTo mention a few, investing funds in presale entails purchasing QTM at a reduced cost, allowing you to purchase more (and gain much more from them).\n\nAdditionally, you'll have unique access to incentives and free airdrops and be able to trade QTM tokens on trading platforms before its widespread adoption.\n\nQTM is currently available at a low price and has the potential to grow 50x or 100x in value since it is built on a compelling use case, and it may very well replicate the success of Avalanche and Polygon.\n\nCheck out the links for more information:\n\nPresale: https://presale.quitriam.io/register\n\nWebsite: https://quitriam.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/QUITRIAMFINANCEOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/quitriamfinance\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/quitriam_finance\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the editors or management of EconoTimes",

Let\u2019s find out how you can invest in Caprice Finance (CFT) and its investment potential.\n\nRipple finds a new partner in Allbridge\n\nRipple has been added by Allbridge, and it will enable decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions to be deployed on the XRP ledger. This is a significant development and will push the price of XRP coin higher in the short term. The XRP ledger houses a decentralised exchange, and Allbridge will ensure that DeFi and other financial products can be rolled out on Ripple\u2019s network. It brings Ripple one step closer to additional layer 1 solutions that offer such services. XRP remains one of the most important cryptocurrency tokens with many holders.\n\nThe XRP token was trading at $0.75 and can be added at this level to realise some upside gains in the near future.\n\nAvalanche plans to raise $350 million\n\nAva Labs, the company behind the popular crypto token AVAX, has announced plans to raise $350 million to push research and development efforts on the AVAX blockchain. The news resulted in bullish behaviour for the token, and AVAX was trading at the $78.7 level at the time of writing. The Avalanche blockchain network has offered competition to the likes of Ethereum with better security and interoperability. The large capital being raised could further propel the AVAX coin.\n\nCaprice Finance could overtake other popular tokens\n\nThe Caprice Finance token is currently available through a presale at a particularly appealing price.\n\nThe CFT token will be offered on multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. The Caprice Finance creators are trying to build an NFT and metaverse space that are the hottest topics in the crypto-verse today. Each transaction will ensure the burning of some CFT tokens that can never come into circulation again. The CFT token is, therefore, a deflation currency, and as the supply reduces over time, the price should see high appreciation.\n\nThe NFT marketplace being built by Caprice Finance will allow users to transfer and burn their existing NFTs on the CFT blockchain. It will provide NFT creators with the ability to seek royalties and sell their NFTs easily. Being cross-chain compatible, it is up to the creator to choose a network. Creators could opt for a network with low fees and even shift between different blockchains as required.\n\nBenefits of CFT token\n\nThe CFT token will provide users with airdrops in the form of rewards from transaction fees. So the more tokens you have, the higher rewards you can reap. This unique attribute allows CFT holders to multiply their gains without much risk. Just buy and hold onto your CFT tokens and let them multiply over time.\n\nIn the future, the platform will incorporate support for yield farming, and it is currently being sold for a price of $0.004. Considering the immense potential of the CFT token, the presale is a good investment opportunity and could result in high gains for its users.\n\nWhile Ripple and avalanche can see a potential gain of anywhere between 10%-20%, CFT token could very well provide higher returns in the range of 30X to 50X since it is grossly undervalued. Investors are purchasing heavy volumes, and the passive income generated by the coin is an attractive feature not available on other major coins.\n\nHead over to the official site and learn more about the CFT token. The site has listed all documents where you can find out about the project.\n\nMore Information is available here:\n\nhttps://presale.capricefinance.com/register\n\nhttps://capricefinance.com/\n\nhttps://t.me/CAPRICEFINANCEOFFICIAL\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Caprice_Finance",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\"\">Blockchain ecosystems can\u2019t effectively operate in isolation forever.\n\nWith increasing adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT), that is blockchain and blockless technologies, and the rise of alternative but equally effective decentralized solutions, cross-chain ledgers are expected to play a big role in blockchain interoperability in 2022 and even find more acceptance in 2023.\n\nBlockchain Interoperability is the Future\n\nInteroperability is a blockchain feature enabling a public network to share data and communicate with each other effortlessly. Whenever a blockchain has cross-chain capabilities, the dApp ecosystem will boom and the technology will find more reception.\n\nBecause of ledger compatibility, a user in one network, like Ethereum, can also quickly send data to another equally secure and open-source network, like Cardano, with the receiving user having no trouble interpreting data.\n\nIt is the infinite possibilities arising when fully decentralized blockchain networks swiftly share information that has, in recent days, seen more developers prepare their systems to be interconnected by default.\n\nThe ERC-20 Cardano Converter Tool\n\nInput-Output Global (IOG) \u2014 the developers of Cardano, together with their development partners, are at an advanced stage of development and will soon release the ERC20 to Cardano Converter tool. They believe that blockchain solutions should be accessible to all regardless of their choice protocol.\n\nThe ERC20 Cardano Converter tool is a bridge that allows projects in Ethereum to deploy solutions on Cardano while using the same ERC-20 tokens. On Cardano, Ethereum dApps will access better scaling and dApp users enjoy relatively low on-chain transaction fees.\n\nWhy Ethereum and ERC-20 Tokens?\n\nThe decision to, in the meantime, support the conversion of ERC-20 tokens to Cardano native tokens is by design. Ethereum is a fully functional, widely adopted, decentralized, and has a vibrant dApp ecosystem. At the same time, the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum is well-designed. It is also the world\u2019s most popular standard for minting fungible tokens. These tokens can be swapped for another and bear the same properties. Most importantly, it is effortless to release. As of early Q2 2022, over 516k ERC-20 tokens served as payment and transaction units, security assets, rewards, powering investment mechanisms, and more.\n\nChallenges in Ethereum and What Cardano Brings to the Table\n\nHowever, scaling challenges in Ethereum remain a huge impediment to adoption as Gas rises to untenable levels. Although Ethereum developers\u2019 primary objective is to create scaling solutions, even changing their roadmap to incorporate their quest for scalability, this resolution might take months. Therefore, by eventually launching an ERC20 Converter, IOG and its development partners are delivering an irresistible proposal highlighting the features of Cardano like high processing speeds and negligible low fees that can be leveraged by projects on Ethereum searching for fitting alternatives.\n\nAt the height of Cardano is the lightweight Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism designed to scale from the onset. Moreover, the UTxO model adopted by Cardano, inherited from Bitcoin, doesn\u2019t demand smart contract execution costs since there is a default native token functionality. In the Cardano setup, the primary ledger tracks all transactions \u2014 relieving smart contracts serving that demanding role in account-based models.\n\nThe Rise of Cardano Native Tokens\n\nFollowing the activation of the Alonzo Upgrade, Cardano supports smart contracts. Also, users are free to create native tokens in a relatively risk-free manner. There are over 40,000 unique native tokens deployed in a scalable, low-fee, and decentralized blockchain ledger guided by peer review.\n\nThe ERC-20 to Cardano Converter tool would allow interested organizations and projects to migrate their tokens to Cardano quickly \u2014 and vice versa.\n\nOnce migrated, these tokens are converted into Cardano native tokens inheriting all value and functionality from Ethereum. Because of the backed-in two-way interoperability, users can also move their tokens to Ethereum by burning a similar amount on Cardano.\n\nERC-20 Cardano Converter Tool in Test Network\n\nAs the Converter tool is optimized and its infrastructure configured, IOG is presently working with Singularity \u2014 an Ethereum-based project \u2014 to create a permissioned ERC-20 to Cardano Converter in the Ethereum Kovan testnet.\n\nUsers can connect using their Daedalus or Yoroi and MetaMask non-custodial wallets to receive native and ERC-20 tokens. At the same time, following the activation of Plutus Smart Contracts at the end of Goguen, IOG plans to support more partners. Their eventual plan is to promote effective and secure interoperability, laying out the ERC-20 Converter tool as a reliable bridge.\n\nGenius X Projects to Massively Benefit\n\nCardano is a high-performance blockchain whose creators are already working on building and collaborating on useful bridges with other similarly high power blockchains. Therefore, the successful launch of the ERC-20 Converter tool will be a massive milestone for the proof-of-stake network. It will make Cardano more liquid as more projects would easily migrate from competing blockchains and deploy in the network without the need for technical coding skills.\n\nThe Converter tool will introduce millions of people to Cardano-based projects, including those finding business development and technical support through the Genius X accelerator program. Besides, converted ERC-20 tokens can be traded for other native tokens cheaply on secure swapping platforms like Genius DEX.\n\nOriginal Source: https://medium.com/@GeniusXOfficial/what-is-the-erc-20-cardano-converter-tool-c0ef2ff2cb35\n\nDisclaimer: Cardano Feed is a Decentralized News Aggregator that enables journalists, influencers, editors, publishers, websites and community members to share news about the Cardano Ecosystem.

            "text": "As France braces for the April 24 presidential election in a runoff, political pundits around the globe are making their bets. The choice is between the centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron and right-wing populist Marine Le Pen. Much of the political debate this time revolves around economics, but there is one indispensable part of it that is largely absent from the candidates\u2019 electoral agendas: digital assets. While both have a record of public statements on matters related to crypto, neither Macron nor Le Pen seems to be likely to trigger any significant policy change with regard to the French digital economy.\n\nState of the art\n\nDespite the current administration\u2019s notable efforts to embrace the IT industry, France is still, in many ways, not a particularly tech-friendly country. For years, its authorities have been fighting in the avant-garde of the European regulatory cause against United States tech behemoths\u2019 tax \u201coptimization\u201d practices, such as opening European offices in more relaxed jurisdictions such as Ireland and Luxembourg.\n\nIn the way of regulation, the country does not have a specific regime for crypto, but the general regulatory climate is rather harsh. The main legislation regulating the industry is the 2019 Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation of enterprises, or PACTE. It obliges any crypto firms in France (legally defined as digital asset service providers) to register with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) and to comply with the Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements set out by the European Union\u2019s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.\n\nPerhaps the biggest headache for the crypto industry is the strict Know Your Customer (KYC) policy, which sets no transaction value threshold for invoking reporting rules. In other words, every crypto transaction worth 1 euro or more requires a full KYC procedure, including the disclosure of the parties\u2019 full names, addresses and contact details.\n\nOn the bright side, disciplined industry players have a chance at obtaining a special license from the AMF, allowing them to apply for French bank accounts. As Thibault Verbiest, a Paris-based partner at the law firm Metalaw, explained to Cointelegraph, French banks are reluctant to open bank accounts for crypto companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the central bank of France is actively exploring a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nFrench regulatory activism\n\nFrench officials play an active role in the international regulatory process. In February 2021, Robert Oph\u00e8le, chairman of the AMF, proposed consolidating all the power and responsibility for crypto regulation in the hands of the European Securities and Markets Authority. He also emphasized the crucial role of blockchain technology in the future of the European economy. The proposition was later repeated by the French government.\n\nFour months later, in June 2021, Bank of France governor Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau doubled down on the call to create a pan-European crypto regulatory framework as soon as possible. In contrast to Oph\u00e8le, de Galhau\u2019s perspective on the matter sounded far less friendly.\n\nStressing the threat of crypto eroding \u201cmonetary sovereignty,\u201d he estimated that Europe had only one or two years to solve the problem. The EU regulators responded with some major initiatives, such as stepping up work on the Market in Crypto-Assets regulatory framework and the current Transfer of Funds Regulation\u2019s revision with tighter scrutiny of individuals\u2019 transactions.\n\nNevertheless, the French government has made efforts to support the crypto industry domestically. \u201cFrance has put itself at the forefront of crypto innovation, at least in terms of the adoption of the regulatory framework and some partnerships with major actors of the industry and the support via the financing of new projects,\u201d Verbiest observed.\n\nIn November 2021, standing alongside C\u00e9dric O, the French secretary of state for the digital economy, Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao announced a partnership with the local financial technology association France FinTech, pledging to spend $115 million on the development of the European crypto industry.\n\nCautious balancing vs. disinterested suspicion\n\nAccording to a recent study, 4% of French adults consider cryptocurrencies a topic that will determine their vote in the presidential election. This modest number is reflected in the amount of attention both candidates have been giving to crypto.\n\nA former banker himself, Macron has taken a cautious stance by largely repeating calls for more regulation. At the Davos International Forum in 2018, he called Bitcoin (BTC) and digital currencies \u201cthe most aggressive players on the financial markets [...] who can create financial crises and deregulate systems,\u201d alongside shadow banking.\n\nAs Verbiest reminded, Macron was trained to be a high-ranking official of France\u2019s treasury department. Thus, it\u2019s only natural for him to prioritize the European banking sector\u2019s anxieties over the interests of the digital economy:\n\n\u201cCrypto disrupts banking, and France has a very powerful banking sector. In addition, the European Union and the euro require that France find a consensus with the other European member states on monetary and financial questions.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Macron\u2019s first term brought into the halls of power at least two notable individuals who openly support the crypto industry. Back in 2019, O promised \u201call crypto-asset and blockchain actors\u201d support by setting up \u201ccomprehensive and credible conditions\u201d for growth. Several years later, though, O justified the tightening of AML/CFT and dismissed crypto entrepreneurs\u2019 reservations about the policy, saying that he didn\u2019t believe that France was \u201cmissing the train of blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the current President of France. Source: www.elysee.fr\n\nPierre Person, a 33-year-old member of the French Parliament, was one of the co-founders of the youth organization, Les Jeunes avec Macron, as well as the \u201cleft-wing liberal\u201d think tank in support of Macron\u2019s policies, La Gauche Libre. In 2019, he presented a business-friendly report on blockchain to the French legislators and has been advocating for the creation of the European stablecoin ever since.\n\nMore recently, however, Person stepped down from the leadership position in Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche movement and shared his disenchantment with the government\u2019s actions on crypto.\n\nMacron\u2019s contender, the leader of the familial nationalist party National Rally, Le Pen, always preferred to talk about immigration threats rather than the digital economy. However, she has her own record of a U-turn toward crypto in public speeches.\n\nMarine Le Pen, Member of the French National Assembly and presidential candidate. Source: mlafrance.fr\n\nIn 2016, ahead of the previous election, she called for Bitcoin\u2019s ban, presenting it (and the digital currencies in general) as an idea originating from the \u201cpowerful Wall Street business lobby.\u201d Since then, Le Pen has toned down the Wall Street narrative, limiting herself to support of strict regulation of crypto assets. In contrast to Macron\u2019s entourage, she or her confederates are yet to say a good word about either cryptocurrency or blockchain technology more generally.\n\nNo to self-regulated sector, yes to pan-European approach\n\nIrrespective of the outcome of Sunday\u2019s vote, France will likely stay in line with the pan-European regulatory process that the country itself has been contributing to for years. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Stephen Stonberg, CEO of crypto exchange Bittrex Global, commented:\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that France would have any major issues with the EU\u2019s upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets [MiCA] regulation, as French regulators will be aware that a pan-European approach will be necessary to adequately oversee the industry. In fact, it\u2019s more likely that French regulators are waiting for MiCA before making any major moves or commitments.\u201d\n\nShould Macron prevail, his administration will likely stay on its current course \u2014 a combination of cautiously crypto-friendly (with an emphasis on blockchains, not currencies) rhetoric and strict but not prohibitive policy toward digital assets, in full accordance with the FATF and EU frameworks.\n\nA great summary of Macron\u2019s ambiguous relationship with crypto is his interview, given several days before the second round of the election. Responding to questions on digital assets and Web3, the incumbent managed to elude pronouncing the word \u201ccrypto\u201d once while uttering familiar phrases about his country\u2019s mission to become the leader in the digital economy and support innovations. Perhaps, the most important words are:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in a self-regulated financial sector. This would be neither sustainable nor democratic. It is up to the public authorities to define the right conditions to allow the sector to develop in confidence while encouraging innovation.\u201d\n\nWith Le Pen, there is always a chance of a distinct anti-EU stance, but it\u2019s hardly good news for the crypto industry. The candidate, who mixes bits of left and right sentiments in her populist cocktail, hasn\u2019t given any signs that she could be particularly interested in the digital economy.",

He says France under Macron would likely remain on track for a sustained period of faster gains in employment and per-capita GDP.

Among them was Tom Lamont, with Belgium\u2019s far-right Vlaams Belang party, an ally of Le Pen\u2019s National Rally. He, too, sent out a message of hope. \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment she lost but we see the right-wing movements is growing in France \u2026 and maybe in five years we will have a right-wing president\u201d here,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez says that with the victory of Emmanuel Macron as projected by polling agencies, \u201cDemocracy wins, Europe wins.\u201d\n\n\u201cCitizens have chosen a France committed to a free, strong and fair EU,\u201d S\u00e1nchez, who is also leader of Spain\u2019s Socialist Party, wrote, referring to the 27-nation European Union.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, Portugal\u2019s Ant\u00f3nio Costa and Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz had published a joint open letter ahead of Sunday\u2019s election presenting the vote as a choice between Macron, a defender of democracy in a strong European Union, and Marine Le Pen, \u201can extreme-right candidate who openly sides with those who attack our freedom and democracy, values based on the French ideas of Enlightenment.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 French far-right figure Eric Zemmour, who failed to reach the runoff in the presidential election, has called for a nationalist coalition to be created in France\u2019s parliament.\n\nZemmour spoke after polling agencies projected that far-right leader Marine Le Pen, head of the National Rally party, had lost the presidential election to centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron.\n\nZemmour, who created his own party, \u201cReconquest,\u201d in recent months, said \u201cthe national bloc must get united.\u201d\n\nHe suggested such a coalition ahead of June\u2019s parliamentary elections, with the aim to fight both Macron\u2019s party and the left.\n\nZemmour received 7% of the votes in the first round of the presidential election on April 10.\n\n___\n\nEuropean leaders have been quick to congratulate French President Emmanuel Macron on his re-election.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has often sparred with Macron over Brexit and other issues, swiftly congratulated the re-elected president.\n\nCalling France \u201cone of our closest and most important allies,\u201d Johnson said he looked forward to \u201ccontinuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.\u201d\n\nItalian Premier Mario Draghi said that Macron\u2019s victory \u201cis splendid news for all of Europe.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cFrance and Italy are working side by side, along with the other European partners, to construct a stronger, more cohesive, more just European Union, capable of being a protagonist in the greatest challenges of our times, starting with the war in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nPortugal\u2019s Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa says that, by voting for Emmanuel Macron, \u201cFrench people have demonstrated once again their commitment to the European project.\u201d\n\nCosta, a socialist who was re-elected earlier this year in a landslide victory, wrote Sunday in a tweet that he was enthusiastic about working together with the centrist politician during the next four years.\n\nThe Portuguese prime minister made a case for voting to elect Macron in an open letter also signed by his Spanish and German counterparts, Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Olaf Scholz.\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 Leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said Sunday that Marine Le Pen\u2019s defeat in the French election is \u201cvery good news for the unity of our people,\u201d and vowed to lead the fight against Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party in the upcoming parliamentary elections.\n\nMelenchon, who failed to reach the second round by a few hundred thousand votes and had urged his supporters not to vote for Le Pen, said Macron\u2019s \u201cpresidential monarchy survives by default and under the constraint of a biased choice.\u201d\n\nIn his address, Melenchon exhorted Macron\u2019s opponents to vote in June\u2019s parliamentary elections to \u201cchoose a different path\u201d and elect a majority of leftist lawmakers. Melenchon said he would be prepared to lead an opposition government.\n\n\u201cCourage, action, determination, always refusing fatality and resignation,\u201d Melenchon said.\n\n___\n\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Several European leaders and politicians have swiftly congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron for his reelection, as his far-right rival Marine Le Pen conceded defeat in Sunday\u2019s presidential election.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted in French, \u201ctogether we will make France and Europe advance.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch prime minister also tweeted in French his hope to \u201ccontinue our extensive and constructive cooperation in EU and NATO.\u201d\n\nIn Germany, politicians around the political spectrum offered support, including from the pro-business Free Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and conservative Christian Social Union.\n\nMany in Europe had worried Le Pen would undermine European unity and its post-war order.\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has conceded defeat in the presidential runoff, handing victory to incumbent Emmanuel Macron.\n\nShe said her unprecedented score in a presidential election represents \u201ca shining victory in itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ideas we represent are reaching summits,\u201d she said.\n\nFrench polling agencies are projecting that centrist Macron has won the runoff against Le Pen that took place Sunday.\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 French polling agencies are projecting that centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron will win France\u2019s presidential runoff Sunday, beating far right rival Marine Le Pen in a tight race that was clouded by the Ukraine war and saw a surge in support for extremist ideas.\n\nIf the projections are borne out by official results, Macron would be the first French president in a generation to win a second term, since Jacques Chirac in 2002. But he would face a divided nation and a battle to keep his parliamentary majority in legislative elections in June.\n\nFive years ago, Macron won a sweeping victory over Le Pen to become the youngest French president. The margin is expected to be way smaller this time: Polling agencies Opinionway, Harris and Ifop-Fiducial projected that Macron would win between 57% and 58.5% of the vote, with Le Pen getting between 41.5% and 43%.\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 Voter turnout is lower than usual in France\u2019s presidential runoff Sunday, apparently reflecting voter frustration with both candidates, centrist President Emmanuel Macron and far-right challenger Marine Le Pen.\n\nTurnout at 5 p.m. Paris time (1500 GMT) stood at 63%, the Interior Ministry said. That was below the 65% at the same time in the last presidential runoff in 2017, when Macron overwhelmingly beat Le Pen, and the 72% in when Socialist Francois Hollande won the presidency in 2012.\n\nPolls before Sunday\u2019s election gave Macron a solid lead over Le Pen, but to keep it he needs the support of many left-wing voters who shunned both him and Le Pen in the first-round election on April 10. Many of those voters may choose to stay home this time instead.\n\nPolling agency projections and early official results are expected after final voting stations close in France at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).\n\n___\n\nLE TOUQUET, France \u2014 The two candidates for France\u2019s presidential runoff have cast their ballots \u2014 and basked in adoring crowds outside their polling stations.\n\nFar-right leader Marine Le Pen went first, cheerily greeting election workers in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont, in France\u2019s struggling former industrial heartland. She emerged from the ballot booth beaming to drop it in a transparent box. Outside, she took selfies with supporters.\n\nThen came incumbent Emmanuel Macron, who shook dozens of hands \u2014 and was handed a small child to hold up \u2014 on his journey from his family home in the resort town of Le Touquet on the English Channel to his voting station.\n\nInside, he greeted yet more people, posed for photographs with his wife Brigitte, and cast his ballot with a wink for the cameras. The voting booths were shielded by curtains in the red-white-and-blue of the French flag.\n\nAbout 48.8 million voters are eligible to take part in the runoff, which is being watched around Europe. Early results are expected Sunday night.\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 France began voting in a presidential runoff election Sunday with repercussions for Europe\u2019s future.\n\nCentrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron is the front-runner, but he\u2019s fighting a tough challenge from far-right rival Marine Le Pen.\n\nThe centrist Macron is asking voters to trust him for a second five-year term despite a presidency troubled by protests, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. A Macron victory in this vote would make him the first French president in 20 years to win a second term.\n\nThe result of voting in France, a nuclear-armed nation with one of the world\u2019s biggest economies, could also impact the conflict in Ukraine, as France has played a key role in diplomatic efforts and support for sanctions against Russia.",

            "text": "Update (1400ET): The first projections of the outcome of the 2022 French presidential vote are in, and it looks like President Emmanuel Macron will keep his post for another five-year term, winning by a margin of 58.2% to Marine Le Pen's 41.8%, according to initial results reported by French newspaper Le Monde. Le Pen has conceded, making his victory all but confirmed.\n\n2022 French presidential election: #Macron wins 58,2% of the votes, Marine #LePen gets 41,8%, according to the first projections. pic.twitter.com/vT6EywsiZK \u2014 Le Monde in English (@LeMonde_EN) April 24, 2022\n\nThe election has also been called by AFP, the largest and most authoritative news service in France.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the exit polls.\n\nFrench TV stations Macron's winning percentage at between 57.3% and 58.2%, citing results from five pollsters.\n\nThe victory makes Macron the first French president to win a second term in two decades - the first since Jacques Chirac, who left office in 2007.\n\nPerhaps the most notable aspect of this vote is that Macron won by a much smaller margin; his margin of victory this time is narrower than 20 percentage points, compared with 30 percentage points last time around. According to Bloomberg, the rise in support for Le Pen reflects a \"bitterly divided country\".\n\nDuring a rally after the vote, Le Pen said the results \"represents a stunning victory,\" before leading her supporters in a chorus of the national anthem. \"Millions of people voted for the national camp and for change.\"\n\nIt's likely that the news of Macron's victory will be embraced by markets around the world, as Wall Street analysts had projected that a Le Pen victory would have been an even bigger shock to international markets than the results of the Brexit referendum in 2016.\n\n* * *\n\nEARLIER\n\nThe day, which some believe could have a more turbulent outcome for European markets than Brexit, has arrived as French voters are heading to the polls for the second time in two weeks to conclude a presidential election in which polls suggest incumbent centrist Emmanuel Macron has the advantage in surveys over nationalist Marine Le Pen. Polling stations are open since 7am on Sunday and set to close at 7pm (London time), when the first official estimate will also be released.\n\nPolls close in #presidentielles2022 at 7pm tonight IST, when our friends @Francetele will project findings of their exit poll. Watch @France2tv\u2019s live coverage from 6.25pm tonight @rtenews channel.pic.twitter.com/cPG6AqQMv6 \u2014 Jon Williams (@WilliamsJon) April 24, 2022\n\nAlthough the televised debate (last Wednesday April 20) between the two contenders provided a boost to voting intentions in favor of Macron (by between 1 and 2 points, from 55% to 57% according to the polls), this appear to have been short-lived. Today (April 22), voting intentions for Macron fluctuated between 53% and 55% (with a margin error of between 1% and 3%).\n\nAccording to Goldman, polls this close to election day have historically tended to be fairly precise for similarly tight races, which explains why prediction markets repriced Mr. Macron\u2019s odds of winning higher at 90%, up from 80% last week. While the polls point to a Macron victory, there remains some limited scope for a victory for M. Le Pen as uncertainty around the final choice of those who voted for Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round remains. Furthermore, some early surprises indicate that change may be coming: as the Globe and Mail notes, Le Pen has won the voting in Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana; Macron won all three in 2017.\n\nMacron won all three in 2017\u2026 https://t.co/zNvzptrRaS \u2014 Mark MacKinnon (@markmackinnon) April 24, 2022\n\nThe blackout period has started at 11pm last night (London time). This means that both contenders will have to cease campaigning - last public intervention in the media was yesterday evening on French television LCI) and no more opinion polls will be released before the run-off result.\n\nBy midday French time, 26.41% of the electorate had voted, according to figures from the interior ministry. That\u2019s lower than at the two previous elections in 2017 and 2012 when the participation rate at the same time was 28.23% and 30.66% respectively. But it\u2019s slightly higher than the level seen in the first round two weeks ago, when 25.48% had voted by 12 p.m.\n\nMacron will vote in Le Touquet where he and his wife own property.\n\nLa France est un bloc. #MacronFigeac pic.twitter.com/zOituVAZK3 \u2014 Emmanuel Macron avec vous (@avecvous) April 22, 2022\n\nLe Pen will cast her ballot in Henin-Beaumont, a town in the north where her party holds city hall and where she was elected as lawmaker for the first time.\n\n\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 Peuple de France, l\u00e8ve-toi ! Je suis pr\u00eate \u00e0 te redonner ta dignit\u00e9, ta confiance, ta grandeur ! #DimancheJeVoteMarine pic.twitter.com/1Wx0Dx58j5 \u2014 Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) April 22, 2022\n\nBackground\n\nWe've previewed the differences in the two platforms previously but here is a refresher courtesy of Bloomberg: needless to say, the candidates\u2019 plans are diametrically opposed. At home, Macron, is sticking to his credo of pro-business overhauls -- including an increase in the retirement age -- to foster more work and make the economy more competitive. Le Pen wants the French to retire even earlier than the current minimum of 62 and promises steep cuts to sales and income taxes to help households.\n\nIn their vision of Europe, Macron is holding his trademark line on strengthening European sovereignty with projects that could include more joint-investment. While Le Pen no longer wants to exit the EU, her proposals to transform it into a looser alliance of nations and hold a referendum to assert the primacy of French law over its rules would undermine the bloc from within.\n\nThe showdown is a repeat of the 2017 election, when Macron beat Le Pen with a hefty margin of almost 33 percentage points. This time, the last polls published before Saturday\u2019s campaigning blackout showed the gap at about 11 points; it could very well be far less.\n\nAfter the first round on April 10, markets were spooked when the gap between the two candidates was as slim as two percentage points. But Macron gradually pulled further ahead as Le Pen failed to capitalize on gains she\u2019d made by centering her campaign on how to solve a looming cost-of-living crisis. According to Bloomberg, Marine had an opportunity to close the gap during nearly three hours of live debate with Macron on Wednesday. Yet she struggled to do so, while Macron turned the spotlight on policies that echo her father\u2019s more extremist views, such as banning the Muslim veil in all public spaces.\n\nFor her part, Le Pen told voters in northern France on the final day of campaigning Friday, that Macron was trying to \u201cbrutalize\u201d her during the debate and that \u201cthe disdain\u201d he showed her was reflective of how he sees the French.\n\nAt the other end of the county in the southern town of Figeac, Macron called on his supporters to convince as many people as possible to rally round him, an attempt to activate the \u201cRepublican front\u201d -- a term for cross-party opposition that has prevented the far-right from taking power. He insisted his victory isn\u2019t a done deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a referendum on the future of France,\u201d Macron told BFMTV. \u201cI am working until midnight and then I will be in a state of humility and reflection.\u201d\n\nElection Surprise?\n\nWhile all the polls show Emmanuel Macron is likely to win a second term Sunday, some are cautious and banks from Citigroup to asset manager Amundi warn that markets are underestimating the risk of a surprise. As for polling accuracy, let's not forget that NYT polls showed Hillary Clinton a 85% favorite in the US election in 2016.\n\nNeedless to say, if nationalist Le Pen upsets the incumbent, European stocks will tumble Monday, while French bonds would underperform German securities and the euro could even trade at parity with the dollar in coming months, according to investors and strategists. The full consequences wouldn\u2019t be visible until after legislative elections in June, when it would be clear whether she has a majority to back her proposals to review free trade agreements and re-establish border controls.\n\nAnd yes, memories are still raw from 2016, when investors were blindsided by the strength of populist sentiment in the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and the U.S. election of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIt would be an awful day for markets,\u201d said Eric Hassid, a trader at Aurel BGC in Paris. \u201cI still think Macron will win, but the opinion polls that come after the presidential debate will be crucial. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time there\u2019s a surprise. We had the same with Brexit.\u201d\n\nAccording to many, a Le Pen victory arguably would be an even bigger shock to investors, since the polls show a larger lead for Macron than they did for the U.K.\u2019s remain vote in 2016. And French pollsters have a good track record, with surveys ahead of the 2017 election and in this year\u2019s first round of balloting very much in line with the outcomes.\n\nThere would be \u201ca Black Monday\u201d in the stock market if Le Pen wins, with the Stoxx 600 probably down 6% and France\u2019s CAC 40 Index sinking more than that, said Ludovic Labal, manager of the Strategic Europe Quality Fund at Eric Sturdza Investments.\n\nIn a note Wednesday, Barclays strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote they expect at least a 5% drop in equity markets in the event of a Le Pen victory but see no reason to panic right now. Oddo BHF strategist Sylvain Goyon put the probability of a Le Pen win at no greater than what it was five years ago, but such an event would be particularly unfavorable to financial stocks, while the euro would likely move below parity against the dollar.\n\nOn the credit side, Barclays strategists warned that corporate bond investors shouldn\u2019t get too blas\u00e9 about the possibility of Le Pen becoming the next president, saying that risks are skewed to the downside.\n\n\u201cIt would only take one poll indicating a tighter race to trigger an underperformance of French credits,\u201d the Barclays analysts wrote. \u201cGiven the lack of any risk premium in these credits, we remain wary.\u201d\n\nViraj Patel, a macro strategist at Vanda Research, recommends buying credit-default swaps on Italian government bonds as a hedge against the risk of more fragmented euro area post-election. He also sees a potential Le Pen victory as sparking a \u201cfull capitulation\u201d of those betting on a stronger euro.\n\n\u201cA Le Pen victory would give us the conviction we need to be calling for euro-dollar parity, but that may be more of a three- to six-month type of evolution rather than happening knee-jerk on the day,\u201d he said.\n\nGiven that Le Pen would need to win a parliamentary majority in June to fully implement her policies, currency traders should be able to focus on other drivers for the euro such as monetary policy tightening, said Lee Hardman, a foreign-exchange analyst for MUFG Bank.\n\n\u201cThe market potentially could overreact initially to the surprise win for Le Pen but actually the reality may not be as bad as initially feared,\u201d he said, adding that the euro could weaken by 3% to 5% on the initial victory. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fairly constrained in terms of the policies she can really pursue.\u201d\n\nSo no matter what the results of Sunday\u2019s vote are, Bloomberg warns that market volatility could be here to stay until the legislative elections in June.",

On the other hand, online browsers and websites have also become highly susceptible to phishing attacks. Research from an IT security company, Zscaler highlights why these online markets are at risk of over 400% malicious activities. In the end, we\u2019ll discuss the reasons.Zscaler gathered data on over two hundred billion routine transactions, and one hundred fifty threats over the previous year to identify and pursue the cybercriminals worldwide. According to the report, there is a 29% growth in worldwide phishing scams in 2021 with the wholesale industry affecting the most malware attacks. The retail and wholesale industry saw a huge 436% jump in cybercrime. Zscaler's report analyzed different parameters and concluded that SMS phishing, phishing emails, and malicious emails have minimized the technical barriers for hackers. The report also showed more than 60% of phishing attacks were detected in the United States, making it the most vulnerable country for data breaches. Along with that, Singapore, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom also suffered from the malicious attacks with an 829%, 799%, 342%,and 331% increase. In stark contrast, phishing attacks in technology sectors and medical care have significantly dropped to 59% followed by 15%.Phishing as-a-service is one of the main tricks played by scammers. Phishing as a service means that hackers use advanced tools available on the darknet to cause a security threat to an organization and the hacking kits usage allows a hacker to deceive the organization\u2019s security channels and software. Other than this, work-from-home facility after the lockdown has also impacted consumers to purchase items through online apps and sites. Users have no clear idea how to distinguish a genuine website from fraud. Cybercriminals post unauthorized advertisements on websites and urge visitors to other sites that contain malware. Cyberattacks like these are prevalent. In addition to it, scammers use email as a vector to attack the business\u2019s data and in turn demand ransomware from the business owners. Furthermore, threat actors have also become smart enough to use more sophisticated techniques. They hack credentials and transactions of a company and incorporate some sort of malicious malware in the system to hack data and bank details, enabling them to subvert protection and compromise the Company\u2019s system.In order to stop the retail and wholesale industry from phishing attacks, companies must have a control system to initially detect, react and recognize the risk. Security experts must be proactive in blocking unauthorized domains and limit the scammers to use any pre-built phishing kit.Read next: Cybercriminals Impersonate LinkedIn More Than Any Other Brand, New Research Shows",

With an Impact and ESG-driven world still struggling to make meaningful inroads, the Metaverse should not be a mirror of a broken system that merely extends from a hostile war-torn society to an online web3 replica of darkness. Aiza World is a shining exemplar of what a values-driven world should be enabled, where being good can be qualified, measured, and transacted.\n\n\n\nLoan - for - Play: The unique selling point of Aiza World\n\nAiza World is a Metaverse blockchain-based serial game, refining the new protocol of B2B as second life and platform for value exchanges in terms of ESG missions where NFTs represent the key to unlocking a new era of personal values.\n\nBeing a Game series that utilizes the latest blockchain instruments of \u201cPlay-to-Earn, Loan-for-Play,\u201d Aiza World also implements a balanced two-token (financial and non-financial) tokenomics.\n\n$AIZA is the BEP-20 governance token of Aiza World. The utilities of $AIZA include but are not limited to staking tokens, playing the game, participating in auction sessions, and NFT trading. With NFTs, players can build their army and conquer challenges in PVE games, and fight with other players through PVP events and upcoming features to get the in-game token, which is named by the sound of happiness, $AHA.\n\nAiza World is the pioneer in NFTs collateralized loans. Worry-free about financial obstacles and firstly enjoying the happiness in Aiza World is the direction we would bring to our people. Not only do we place a monetary value on people, but we also recognize their worth by rewarding them in various ways for their contributions.\n\nEasy - to - Earn in Aiza World\n\nIn Aiza World, users can earn $AIZA tokens by purchasing NFTs in the game through the marketplace. These NFTs are used by players using their skills in combination with attack and defense cards randomly spawned in the game to win over other players with various terrains.\n\nDiversified fighting styles are one of the plus points of Aiza World, which creates a strong attraction for even new players who want to earn in-game rewards. The project has plans to expand to several game series around the NFTs players own in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe first game series that Aiza World launched was Sniper Master; through the trial version, the project has received positive feedback from investors and game players worldwide.\n\nThrough early investments in this game studio, Aiza World has raised $1M from several international investors in the first round of funding, such as OneBlockLabs, BFRI Singapore, Kretos Ventures, etc.\n\nAn amazing team\n\nA fantastic and cohesive team founded Aiza World. Based on more than 13 years of experience in the technology development and game publishing industries, Henry Nguyen and his close companions ultimately enhance Aiza World to build a genuine metaverse product and valuable NFTs in the virtual world and the actual world.\n\nThe team believes that with the Aiza token, the project also helps create social impact and job opportunities for every walk of life, so the graphics and characters in the game are designed in the direction of flat design, which is unique compared to other game series.\n\nThe Currency of the Metaverse: A World Driven by Value and Values\n\nWith the development momentum of the project, Aiza World is still receiving much global attention from the investor communities and backers.\n\nRecently, Olinga Ta'eed, Ph.D. FIoD, a Metaverse Gamefi pioneer, has been appointed as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Aiza World. He currently serves as a council member and an expert adviser for the 'China E-Commerce Blockchain Committee,' which is a part of The Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China.\n\nHe is internationally recognized in cryptocurrency, but the key to his appointment to Aiza World is his international recognition as the leading authority in the movement of value - measurement, transaction, and delivery. Since 2013, he has been the director of the not-for-profit think tank, The Centre for Citizenship, Enterprise, and Governance (CCEG), with over 200,000 members.\n\nCCEG and Aiza World aim to further develop the Microshare token as the currency of the Metaverse and implement it within decentralized gaming.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nCurrently, Aiza World is holding many challenges for all valid participants to earn $AIZA tokens. In each airdrop campaign, everyone participating will get ONE ticket to spin the lucky draw with a chance to get a valuable gift in a golden box.\n\nMoreover, #Aizaworld will officially launch IDOs on the three reputed Launchpads: IndoEx, P2PB2B, and VinDAX, on April 26, 2022.

Plenty of gaming-related collectibles can now be claimed as NFTs, but some so-called \u201cplay-to-earn\u201d games have gone even further and have crypto and NFT as the stakes.\n\nP2E Games Play For Keeps\n\nPlay-to-earn games, also called P2E games or even just crypto games, are games that have cryptocurrency and NFTs as an integral part of the gameplay. Often, instead of buying the game, you buy stuff within it, like characters or weapons or, well, just about anything.\n\nThis isn\u2019t entirely unique, plenty of games use a similar model, especially so-called free-to-play (F2P) games. These games let you play for free and even let you earn items through gameplay, but the good stuff is usually locked away behind a paywall\u2014or perhaps a very time-consuming grind.\n\nHowever, what sets play-to-earn apart from free-to-play is that you can trade and sell your assets to other players. This is because many of these assets are NFTs, or can be turned into them.\n\nAxie Infinity\n\nTo illustrate this, it\u2019s probably best to use the system used by Axie Infinity, one of the longest running P2E games out there (and also one that recently lost over $600 million dollars.) The idea of the game is simple: players control \u201caxies,\u201d small fantasy creatures, and battle them against other players\u2019 axies. It\u2019s reminiscent of Pok\u00e9mon, but in a heavily monetized form.\n\nPlayers can get axies by buying them ready-made from the in-game store or breeding them for themselves. Breeding involves AXS, the in-game currency combined with what\u2019s called a \u201csmall love potion\u201d or SLP. Both AXS and SLP can be earned by playing the game\u2014fighting other players, competing in tournaments, etc.\u2014or by buying them from the store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHowever, what makes Axie Infinity interesting is that you\u2019re not only spending money, you\u2019re also making it. If you breed a rare axie, you can put it up for sale on the marketplace, for example, and you can also sell your surplus resources. Where in F2P games the money all flows one way\u2014to the developer\u2014P2E games see some flow back, too. Some people even make a living off playing the game.\n\nThe P2E Business Model\n\nHowever, not as much flows back as you\u2019d think. In an environment where everything costs money, the people who control that environment have ways of adjusting things in such a way that they always come out on top. After all, if they didn\u2019t there wouldn\u2019t be much of a business left.\n\nAs a result, everything in Axie Infinity costs money. Getting an axie will set you back a few Ether\u2014the cryptocurrency the game runs on\u2014SLPs cost Ether and AXS costs Ether. Technically, many of these resources can be earned in-game, but they are often set on timers so the amount you can earn is actually curtailed unless you spend some real-world money.\n\nOn paper, you could play the game on just a minimal investment: buy the starter axies and then grind until you get enough AXS and SLPs to get new critters and go from there. However, P2E games have taken a leaf out of the book of psychological tricks used by F2P games and set up players to buy into the game even more.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s such a wide variety of axies and traits for them, that you\u2019re always tempted to get more of them\u2014anybody who has ever collected anything knows this frenzy you can get into. These traits also translate into gameplay, and players who pay into the game will usually have better traits for their axies.\n\nAs a result, paying players will often grind free players into dust. This, in turn, turns free players either away from the game or gets them to increase their expenditure so as to remain competitive. It\u2019s a cycle that\u2019s hard to get out of and can be the start of an addiction.\n\nOther P2E Games\n\nTo be clear, we\u2019re only using Axie Infinity as one example, other P2E games like Gods Unchained or the planned Illuvium use much the same tactics, just in slightly different forms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTechnically, Gods Unchained, which is a battle game based around cards much like Magic: The Gathering, is a free-to-play game. Your cards are collectible, but you actually need to perform a special action to make them into tradable NFTs. Until then, they\u2019re just game assets. However, to get good cards, you need to spend some money to hurry the process along.\n\nIlluvium, which also is about letting fantasy beasts fight each other, tears the veil away completely and advertises that it will host betting on fights between players, as well as letting you trade fighters with other players.\n\nDo You Really Own Your In-Game Assets?\n\nIt\u2019s not just P2E games\u2019 structure that should raise eyebrows, it\u2019s also what it promises. The idea is that you play the game or pay into it and that you own your assets: axies, cards, or whatever it is that the game has on offer. They\u2019re NFTs after all, and you\u2019re the owner, not the game company. Gods Unchained makes a big deal of this on its website.\n\nHowever, reality proves it\u2019s not quite so simple. There\u2019s a big problem with NFTs, namely that if the server that the records are on gives out, your NFTs disappear into thin air. This has happened, too, and recently.\n\nFor example, F1 Delta Time was a game that let you race cars, which were tokens all their own. Recently, it went bust, and all the associated NFTs are now worthless. Considering that some people paid the equivalent of the cost of a house for some of their cars, that\u2019s a lot of money up in smoke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere are also more conventional risks, like theft. Axie Infinity, for example, was famously victim of a security breach which saw $600 million stolen in March 2022. Considering how much wealth is held in online accounts, they\u2019re a juicy target for criminals looking for a big score.\n\nSo, yes, you own your axies or cards or whatever else it may be that these games are hawking, but only as long as the servers stay up and secure. When you play P2E games, you\u2019re not just betting on the outcome of your match\u2014you\u2019re betting on the company being successful, and we\u2019re not sure if we like those odds.\n\nAs with everything involving cryptocurrency, we recommend you exercise caution if you\u2019re going to get involved in it.",

            "text": "What is the Metaverse?\n\nThe Metaverse is a term coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash to describe a future virtual reality-based online world. Some have gone as far as pronouncing Stephenson\u2019s novel a prediction of the future.\n\nBefore you agree that it\u2019s some mystical peek into the future and invoke the rules of time travel, let\u2019s first investigate what the Metaverse is through the lens of something much more accessible: Minecraft. But, more on this later.\n\nUnlike the internet or even virtual reality as we know it today, the Metaverse would be a fully immersive 3D environment where people could interact with each other and with digital objects as if they were real.\n\nThe Metaverse is yet to be fully existent. However, some platforms have already created experiences close to what the Metaverse will be like. Video games, for example, have already pushed the boundaries of gaming via virtual economies and in-game events.\n\nSimply put, the Metaverse is a concept of an online 3D universe that patchworks various virtual spaces. Much like a future iteration of the web, the Metaverse is coming to fruition bit by slow bit. The goal is to allow users to socialize, game and even work in these 3D spaces.\n\nIt could be said that as technology evolved, the emergence of something like the Metaverse was an inevitability \u2014 a natural evolution of sorts as things ran their course.\n\nRelated: Microsoft metaverse vs. Facebook metaverse: What's the difference?\n\nWhat is Web3?\n\nWeb3 is the third generation of the World Wide Web and refers to the vision of a decentralized web. The first iteration, or Web1, was focused on static content, while Web2 introduced dynamic content and social media features.\n\nNow, with Web3, the focus is shifting toward a more decentralized web where users are in control of their own data. Originally called the \u201cSemantic Web\u201d by inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, Web3 is geared toward enabling websites and applications to process information more autonomously and intelligently.\n\nThrough technologies like Big Data, machine learning and decentralized ledger technology (DLT), data can be processed in a smarter, more human-like way.\n\nHow is Minecraft a helpful tool to understand the Metaverse?\n\nMinecraft is a game that allows players to build and explore in a 3D world. It is also one of the first games to offer a virtual economy, with players able to trade items. As such, Minecraft can be used to understand the concept of the Metaverse.\n\nBy understanding how to use Minecraft, people can better understand the Metaverse and Web3. In addition, they can learn about the potential of these concepts and how they can be used in the real world.\n\nWhat makes Minecraft a great metaverse platform?\n\nA few key factors make Minecraft a great platform for the Metaverse. Minecraft is highly adaptable, meaning that players can create their own content and share it with others. This makes it easy to create new experiences and worlds within the game.\n\nMinecraft also has a large and active community that creates a sense of belonging, allowing players to connect with each other. Most importantly, Minecraft is constantly evolving, with new features and updates being released regularly. This makes it easy to create new experiences and worlds within the game.\n\nThere are many more areas in which Minecraft has succeeded as far as metaverses are concerned. Let\u2019s break them down below:\n\nThe Minecraft metaverse is decentralized \u2014 nobody owns it\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s desire to build the Metaverse via Facebook was met with derision by many in the crypto community.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move gives us a peek into a metaverse largely owned by tech giants like Zuckerberg. It\u2019s Monopoly all over again and goes against the grain of decentralization, which is essentially what the Metaverse is about.\n\nOn the other hand, Minecraft is a great example of a decentralized metaverse. While Microsoft owns the game, it is still an open platform that anyone can access and play. No one company controls the game or dictates what players can do.\n\nMinecraft works well because each metaverse can have its own rules of engagement. On Minecraft, anyone can create a metaverse, as opposed to Facebook's intent to create a monolithic version of the Metaverse. This decentralization is key to the success of the Metaverse, as it allows for a more democratic and open environment where anyone can contribute.\n\nIt\u2019s immersive even with low-fi tech\n\nDespite all the hullabaloo concerning the Metaverse being an extremely high-tech version of everything we know to be true of the web today, Minecraft gives us a glimpse of what it really might be.\n\nMinecraft managed to be exceptionally immersive while using low-fi tech \u2014 no virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) or holograms necessary. The hype surrounding the impending metaverse assumes that digital worlds can only be truly immersive with VR cams strapped to our heads. And, maybe wind blowing into our ears from a nano-fan for good measure so we can really feel the breeze as we walk in our digital garden.\n\nYet, Minecraft proves that metaverses can be immersive even when accessed through plain old computer screens \u2014 no VR goggles required. In case you haven\u2019t tried it yet, Minecraft can run even on very old equipment.\n\nMinecraft has a unique purpose\n\nPeople play Minecraft for different reasons. Some want to create, some want to explore and some just want to socialize. In a way, Minecraft has become a platform for people to do all of these things and more.\n\nThe game offers a unique purpose that sets it apart from other games on the market. This is one of the main reasons why Minecraft has been so successful. It\u2019s a game that can be anything you want it to be, making it perfect for anyone who wants to explore the potential of the Metaverse.\n\nMinecraft Education, for example, allows students to experience and imagine worlds and cultures beyond their own. For example, in partnership with Microsoft, Piki Studios helped students in New Zealand learn about the Te Ao M\u0101ori culture through Minecraft.\n\nRelated: Metaverse for education: How virtual reality can help schools and colleges\n\nHow do people interact within a Minecraft metaverse?\n\nPlayers can interact with each other through various methods such as chat, private messages and forums. In addition, players can also join servers to play together. Servers are dedicated game worlds that players can connect to.\n\nThe most common way to interact within the Metaverse is to contribute within the context of the server you are on. If you\u2019re in a server attempting to reach a huge build, you\u2019ll have to chip in each day to meet the deadline.\n\nIf you\u2019re a part of a second life simulation server, you\u2019ll have to play your role, whether as a warrior, miner or fighter. If you\u2019re on a narrative-driven server with factions and such, you\u2019ll have to roleplay and make the experience as real as possible for all players.\n\nNotable metaverse projects built on top of Minecraft\n\nThere are more than a dozen projects based on the 2011 video game, with Minecraft world seed nonfungible tokens (NFTs) selling for tens of thousands of dollars each.\n\nFor example, NFT Worlds is a collection of 10,000 unique Minecraft world NFTs. Each NFT has a \u201cworld seed,\u201d or a code capable of generating a Minecraft world. Metaverse destinations can also be hosted on a player\u2019s own server with the help of verified builders.\n\nUplift World is another Minecraft metaverse, a play-to-earn metaverse built on the WAX blockchain. It also uses NFTs and has a transportation railway system that\u2019s tokenized.\n\nEnjin, on the other hand, has also been one of the early releasers of a Minecraft metaverse EnjinCraft plugin and Java SDK. This has allowed some people to build a Minecraft metaverse on the blockchain using Enjin and Ethereum, providing a peek into the future as more developers build on top of Minecraft.",

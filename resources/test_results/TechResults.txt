Twitter independent board chair Bret Taylor described the deal as “the best path forward” for the company’s shareholders.\n\nThe result ends prolonged speculation over Musk’s financial interest in Twitter. On April 4, the entrepreneur’s 9.2 percent stake in the company—or 73.5 million shares at a cost of around $2.4 billion—was disclosed to the public. At the time, the purchase of stock in Twitter came with an offer to sit on the board—though on April 10 Musk declined to take his seat.\n\nHe soon made it obvious that he wanted the whole thing. On April 14, Musk offered to buy the remaining percentage of the company for $54.20 per share—a 38 percent premium on the price he paid for his initial investment. Musk’s accompanying letter to the chair of Twitter’s board was strident in its criticism of the platform. “I believe in [Twitter’s] potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” he wrote. However, he added, “I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.”\n\nInstead, he wanted to take the company private, offering $44 billion for it in a “best and final” offer. At the time, analysts were split about the likelihood of Musk’s bid succeeding, and whether it was good value; while it sat in the middle of the usual 30 to 40 percent premium above the trading price, the stock price had reached well above that just last year. Twitter’s board, for its part, said it would evaluate the offer.\n\n“He’s setting a bit of a precedent for activists that will go after a company,” says Timothy Galpin, senior lecturer in strategy and innovation at the Said Business School at the University of Oxford. “It’s been done a bit before by Carl Icahn and a few others, but it’s not as prevalent to go after the whole company.”\n\nOn the same day that he lodged his bid to take over the entirety of Twitter and take it private, Musk appeared at a TED talk in Vancouver, where he laid out his vision. “This is not a way to sort of make money,” he claimed. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important.” That gave some within Twitter, and those who held large shares in the platform, pause.\n\nContemporary reports indicated Twitter would fight to repel Musk, while the Tesla and Space X CEO got into a Twitter spat about press freedom with Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Company, a major shareholder that said it would reject Musk’s offer.

At one point, the stock was down as much as 19%.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group recently launched Truth Social, a Twitter clone aimed at conservatives whom Trump claims Twitter has silenced.\n\n“There’s no need to download Truth Social if you can get it on Twitter,” said Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, which provides IPO-focused ETFs and pro-IPO research.\n\nSince the final trading day before Musk surprised Wall Street by saying he had amassed a stake in Twitter, Digital World has lost 44% of its value. The special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, closed at $63.25 on April 1 before Musk’s announcement April 4.\n\nMusk, a longtime critic of Twitter’s content moderation policies, has vowed to transform Twitter in part by bolstering free speech on the platform. The Tesla CEO agreed to buy Twitter in a deal that values the company at about $44 billion.\n\nA Musk-run Twitter would undercut the rationale for Truth Social, which Trump had promised would “stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.” There is even speculation that Twitter, under Musk’s control, could lift the ban on Trump himself.\n\nTrump weighed in on the issue on Monday, telling Fox News he will not return to Twitter despite Musk’s takeover.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nBelow $36, the implied valuation of Trump Media & Technology Group has tumbled to roughly $7.7 billion, according to Kennedy of Renaissance Capital. That’s down sharply from around $13 billion before Musk disclosed his Twitter investment.\n\n“While the market apparently believes that a Twitter owned by Elon Musk dims the outlook of Truth Social, Trump still has some financial incentives to use Truth,” Kennedy said.\n\nBeyond Musk’s efforts to acquire Twitter, the Trump SPAC has been hurt by the slow start of Truth Social. As CNN reported earlier this month, Truth Social has been plagued by a lengthy waitlist, a lack of content and high-profile contents that appear to be bots.\n\nAt the same time, federal regulators are investigating the Trump SPAC deal and legal experts have told CNN that securities regulators could slow or even derail the merger altogether.\n\nSince hitting a 2022 high of $101.87 on March 2, Digital World is down by about 65%.', 'image': 'https://www.siliconvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hypatia-h_966261470293a8a1f93e0f1c60a617b0-h_3b2f0a435c1f422f2276b67d7f2909d3.jpg?w=1024&h=711', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:54'}

Will banned users return?\n\nMusk has laid out a more relaxed vision for content moderation that would lean toward temporary “timeouts” over permanent bans.\n\nAdvocacy groups are concerned that this switch could reverse Twitter’s permanent bans on public figures and politicians — including former President Trump.\n\n2. Leadership changes: While Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n3. How could the product change?: Major changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n4. Washington’s ire: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech.”\n\n5. How will Twitter’s workers respond?: Twitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCOVID ABSENCES FURTHER DELAY FTC VOTE\n\nThe vote on Alvaro Bedoya’s nomination to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to be further delayed due to COVID-19 linked absences in the Senate, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide.\n\nSens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Vice President Harris all tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans have broadly pushed back on Bedoya’s nomination to the FTC, leaving Democrats in need of all senators and Harris present to secure his confirmation.\n\nThe Senate aide said absent to an objection by Republicans, the Senate is expected to delay the consideration of Bedoya to a later date.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee advanced Bedoya in a vote along party lines in March, after delays based on Sen. Ben Ray Luján’s (D-N.M.) absence while he recovered from a stroke.\n\nAs he awaits confirmation, the FTC remains split along party lines, thwarting Democrats from pushing forward with their full agenda.\n\nEU WARNS MUSK\n\nThierry Breton, the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market, tweeted Tuesday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who just secured a deal to buy Twitter, will have to comply with the commission’s rules on moderation.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules — regardless of their shareholding,” Breton tweeted. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\n“He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nBITS AND PIECES\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Elon Musk’s Twitter purchase brings free speech into sharp focus\n\nLighter click: happy carrot time\n\nNotable links from around the web:\n\nWhat Elon Musk’s battles with Washington might mean for Twitter (Politico / Emily Birnbaum)\n\nHow to Become a MAGA Rap Kingpin (Without Believing What You’re Saying) (Rolling Stone / Alice Hines)\n\nFacebook Doesn’t Know What It Does With Your Data, Or Where It Goes: Leaked Document (Motherboard / Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai)\n\nOne last thing: Truth Social struggles\n\nShares that are tied with the company funding former President Trump’s latest social media venture, Truth Social, took a dive on Monday after social media platform Twitter announced its deal with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nCNBC reported that Digital World Acquisition Corp.’s shares fell to nearly 13 percent on Monday, bringing the company’s year-to-date losses to more than 30 percent.\n\nTruth Social, which officially launched in February, was created by Trump after he was permanently banned from multiple social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram for actions involving the Jan.6 insurrection at the Capitol, CNBC noted.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

In a recent TED interview, the billionaire said he’d like to see Twitter err on the side of allowing speech instead of moderating it. He said he’d be “very reluctant” to delete tweets and would generally be cautious about permanent bans. He also acknowledged that Twitter would have to abide by national laws governing speech in markets around the world.\n\nMusk himself, though, regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and has used the platform to bully reporters who have written critical articles about him or his company.\n\nTwitter’s board at first enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But when Musk outlined the financial commitments he’d lined up to back his offer of $46.5 billion — and no other bidders emerged — the board opened negotiations with him.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nElon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter is gaining steam and could be announced as early as Monday, according to media reports about the social media company\'s late-stage negotiations with the Tesla CEO, who has offered more than $40 billion to privatize the platform and pledged to be more lenient when it comes to policing users\' speech.\n\nTwitter and Musk spoke Sunday and into the early hours Monday, The New York Times reported, less than two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform that he uses to promote his interests, attack critics and opine on social and economic issues to his more than 83 million followers.\n\nMusk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal. Musk hasn\'t commented on the negotiations but on Monday waded into the buzz about them on Twitter, where some users are promising to quit the platform if he takes over.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he tweeted.\n\nMusk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has voiced a number of proposed changes for the company, from relaxing its content restrictions — such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump’s account — to ridding the platform of fake and automated accounts, and shifting away from its advertising-based revenue model.\n\nTwitter’s board has flexibility in judging Musk’s proposal not just on the finances but also the specifics of his business plan and how it could affect users, advertisers and employees — some of whom might leave, said Kevin Kaiser, a finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“What’s critical for the board is whether they think it’s in the best interest of the company,” Kaiser said. “That can come from many, many factors.”\n\nKaiser said the board could decide that Musk’s plan has “too many negative impacts,” but that would be a hard case to make given how much Musk is offering to pay.\n\nAsked during a recent TED talk if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter or any forum is “obviously bound by the laws of the country that it operates in. So obviously there are some limitations on free speech in the US, and, of course, Twitter would have to abide by those rules.”\n\nBeyond that, though, he said he’d be “very reluctant” to delete things and in general be cautious about permanent bans.\n\nIt won’t be perfect, Musk added, “but I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible."\n\nTwitter had initially enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But the board decided to negotiate after Musk updated his proposal last week to show he had secured financing, according to The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the negotiations were underway.\n\nA rival bidder to Musk may not be stepping up any time soon, fearful of the byzantine task of moderating content on the platform, something that Musk has vowed to do less of.\n\n“The Twitter Board could not find a white knight and with Musk’s financing detailed the clock has essentially struck midnight for the board which is why negotiations have begun to get a deal done,” said Dan Ives, who follows Twitter for Wedbush Securities.\n\nThe Times, citing people with knowledge of the situation who it did not identify, said the two sides were discussing details including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart. The people said the situation was fluid and fast-moving.\n\nWhile Twitter’s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as Facebook and TikTok, the service is popular with celebrities, world leaders, journalists and intellectuals. Musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. rose 5% Monday to $51.50 per share. On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy the social media platform for $54.20 per share, or about $43 billion, but did not say at the time how he would finance the acquisition.\n\nLast week, he said in documents filed with U.S. securities regulators that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in Tesla.\n\nTwitter has not commented.\n\nMusk is the world’s wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a nearly $279 billion fortune. But much of his money is tied up in Tesla stock — he owns about 17% of the electric car company, according to FactSet, which is valued at more than $1 trillion — and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It’s unclear how much cash Musk has.\n\nMusk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, to Compaq for $307 million. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly. It was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nThat same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting NASA’s interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets.\n\nIn 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to astronomical success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles.\n\n——\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

Musk said other investors could contribute to the financing.\n\nThe locked-in financing not only underscored the seriousness of Musk\'s pursuit, but also appeared to open the door to other large Twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the San Francisco company.\n\nThe details of those conversations aren’t known, but Musk could point to a more than 20-year history building and running several businesses — most notably as the longtime CEO of Tesla. The electric car maker is currently valued at $1 trillion -- roughly 25 times more than Twitter.\n\n“I think there is nothing better for Twitter than Elon Musk buying it and ideally replacing the board, and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue-generating sources," said John Meyer, a technology entrepreneur and investor. “Musk has the track record that he can do the impossible."\n\nIt would be easy to see why other Twitter shareholders might welcome a shake-up, as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment. Before Musk disclosed his 9% stake in Twitter earlier this month, the shares were trading below $40 — not that much more it its $26 price when Twitter went public in November 2013. Since then, the tech-driven Nasdaq has more than tripled, even after a recent downturn. Twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising, Google and Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla’s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010. And after struggling to make money for more than a decade, the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of $3.3 billion during the first three months of this year alone.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nAs is customary once a company agrees to be acquired, the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren’t any red flags that haven’t come up via the company’s public filings.\n\nThis step in the process isn’t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal, said Angelo Zino, tech analyst at CFRA.\n\n“He’s acquiring this company, not from a financial perspective,” Zino said. “He’s going to do what he wants with it and he’s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company.”\n\nWHAT SAY COULD REGULATORS HAVE?\n\nLast year, Twitter generated $5 billion in revenue, with $2.8 billion from the U.S. and the rest earned overseas, Zino said. The Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., or the European Commission in the EU, are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed Twitter buyout.\n\nThe main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry, or whether it violates antitrust laws.\n\nThese reviews can take months, or longer, but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining, or in the case of a single buyer, whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry.\n\nNeither Tesla, nor Musk’s other company, Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, are social media platforms, so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal, analysts said.\n\n“We do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with Musk owning Twitter,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Monday.\n\nWHEN DO SHAREHOLDERS GET TO VOTE?\n\nThe deal is expected to close in 2022, subject to the approval of Twitter shareholders. Twitter hasn’t announced the timing of a shareholder vote, though the company’s annual meeting is set for May 25, which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders.\n\nA company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time, even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TWITTER LEADERSHIP?\n\nAt this early stage, it’s unclear what will happen to Twitter\'s current board or management team if the deal is completed, but Musk has made it abundantly clear that he believes the company has been poorly run. That assessment is a strong indication that Musk’s makeover will also include a purge of Twitter’s top ranks.', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:56'}

Subsequent events put that moniker to the test, as repressive regimes cracked down on Twitter users, particularly in the wake of the short-lived “Arab Spring” demonstrations. In the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums.\n\nOver the subsequent years, Twitter learned a few things about the consequences of running a largely unmoderated social platform — one of the most important being that companies generally don't want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement, and misinformation that aims to tip elections or undermine public health.\n\n“With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself,” said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. “If you stop moderating with automated systems and human reviews, a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool.”\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the “health” of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the “report abuse” button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy’s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invested in staff and technology that detect violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violates its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used their platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies also stepped up their efforts against political misinformation.\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk, who describes himself as a “free-speech absolutist,” wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nEven now, Americans say they’re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a “fair or poor” job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.\n\nMeanwhile, terms like “censorship” and “free speech” have turned into political rallying cries for conservatives, frustrated by seeing right-leaning commentators and high-profile Republican officials booted off Facebook and Twitter for violating their rules.\n\nMusk appeared to criticize Twitter’s permanent ban of President Donald Trump last year for messages that the tech company said helped incite the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last year.\n\n“A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech,” Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nTrump’s allies, including his son Donald Trump Jr., have even pleaded for Musk to buy out the company.\n\n“If Elon Musk can privately send people into space I’m sure he can design a social network that isn’t biased,” Trump Jr. said in the caption of a video posted to Instagram last April.\n\nKirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame, said Twitter has consistently worked at being a “responsible” social media company through its moderation system, its hires in the area of machine learning ethics and in whom they allow to do research on the platform. The fact that Musk wants to change that, she added, suggests that he's focused on “irresponsible social media.”\n\nTwitter declined to comment for this story. A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to a message for comment.\n\nNew social media apps targeted at conservatives, including Trump’s Truth Social, haven't come remotely close to matching the success of Facebook or Twitter. That's partly because Republican politicians, politicians and causes already draw large audiences on existing, and much better established, platforms.\n\nIt's also partly due to floods of inflammatory, false or violent posts. Last year, for example, right-wing social media site Parler was nearly wiped off the internet when it became evident that rioters had used the app to promote violent messages and organize the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol. Apple and Google barred its app from their online stores, while Amazon stopped providing web-hosting services for the site.\n\nMusk himself regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and sometimes bullies reporters who have written critical articles about him or Tesla. He regularly tweets at reporters who write about his company, sometimes mischaracterizing their work as “false” or “misleading.”\n\nHis popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of the reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\n“I only block people as a direct insult,” Musk tweeted in 2020, responding to a tweet from a reporter.\n\nEvan Greer, a political activist with Fight for the Future, said Musk’s lack of experience in moderating an influential social media platform will be a problem if he successfully takes over the company.\n\n“If we want to protect free speech online, then we can’t live in a world where the richest person on Earth can just purchase a platform that millions of people depend on and then change the rules to his liking,” Greer said.", 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:34'}

However, some of Trump’s advisers told The Washington Post they don’t think he would turn down an offer to return to the platform that brought him so much attention during his campaign and term.\n\nMedia Matters compiled a list of banned Twitter users, including Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander and prominent QAnon figures celebrating Musk’s takeover, that critics believe could pose a threat if allowed back on the platform.\n\n“These folks are organized,” said Jessica González, co-CEO of Free Press and co-founder of Change the Terms.\n\n“I’m really talking about sophisticated, coordinated … efforts to use these platforms to radicalize people, to raise funds, to normalize violence and to issue calls to action for violent and threatening activity that happens in real life,” she added.\n\nLeadership changes\n\nWhile Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n“I think we feel very comfortable that [the deal] gives this team the ability to continue to make the company successful in between signing and closing the transaction,” Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter’s board of directors, reportedly said during a company-wide town hall Monday evening.\n\nOnce the deal is closed however, a shakeup at the top of the company seems likely.\n\nMusk’s relationship with current leadership has not been publicly confrontational. But Musk did reject their offer to join the board, an indication that he might be interested in pursuing his own vision of the platform.\n\nAgrawal will be in line for a $38.7 million pay package if the deal goes through and Musk chooses to terminate him.\n\nIt would be difficult for Musk to head the company alone given his active leadership or involvement in Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink.\n\nWhom Musk chooses to head Twitter if he refreshes current leadership could be the clearest signal of his plans for the platform.\n\n“Once the deal closes, we don’t know which direction the platform will go,” Agrawal reportedly admitted during Monday’s town hall.\n\nHow could the product change?\n\nMajor changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n“I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,” he said in a statement on the deal’s announcement.\n\nMusk has said that algorithms that make recommendations to users on what accounts to follow, posts to view or topics to read up on should be opened to public viewing.\n\nSuch a move could assuage concerns about political bias on the platform and give researchers much-needed access to social media’s levers.\n\nBut Twitter has already been very open about the effect of its algorithms. The company released a study in the fall finding that they tend to amplify right-leaning politicians more than their counterparts.\n\nFully publishing complex algorithms could not only lead to confusion, but open the platform up to cybersecurity risks.\n\nMusk has been very vocal about his desire to cut down on spam on Twitter but has given few specifics about how he would do.\n\nMusk’s proposal to authenticate all humans on Twitter has also prompted worry from civil society groups.\n\nSimple checks like CAPTCHAs before posting would likely be gameable with spam bots, while more stringent checks like ID verification would destroy the pseudonymity that Twitter has worked hard to maintain.\n\nEven if users are not required to post their real names on the platform, that data will have to be collected by Twitter and, therefore, could be compelled by governments to turn it over.\n\nThe impacts on free speech and the right to protest, especially in authoritarian states that already have rules against government criticism on social media, could be devastating.\n\n“There are no easy ways to require verification without wreaking havoc for some users, and for free speech,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in statement.\n\nWashington’s ire\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech overlords.”\n\n“Elon Musk is helping us defeat the Big Tech overlords. Our digital public squares need to be returned to us,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) tweeted.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) echoed Musk’s own words, saying the platform’s “full potential” will be unlocked if Musk can change the platform to “actually protect free speech and encourage open discourse.”\n\nThe GOP support builds on years of attacks on Twitter over claims of the platform censoring content with an anti-conservative bias.\n\nBut Democrats say Musk’s ownership raises additional concerns about the spread of disinformation.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told The Hill.\n\nSome progressives are using Musk’s takeover to push for a wealth tax and elevate concerns about power consolidation.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted.\n\nHow will Twitter’s workers respond?\n\nTwitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\n“Can someone just tell me if I’m rich or fired please,” one said.\n\n“The news today is so crazy I literally forgot I have COVID,” posted another.\n\nThe majority of the company’s 5,000-plus employees work in liberal San Francisco and, until now, have worked for a platform known for its aggressive approach to content moderation.\n\nThe company has led social media competitors in reacting to Trump’s dissemination of election disinformation and the spread of misinformation about COVID-19.\n\nMusk’s version of free speech appears to run counter to that approach, setting up potential ideological clashes.\n\nThe company reportedly took a precautionary measure Monday by temporarily freezing changes to the platform until next week. The move comes after one employee briefly took down Trump’s account several years ago.\n\nMusk also has a less than stellar reputation for the treatment of his employees.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing is in the midst of a lawsuit against Tesla over allegations of racism and harassment toward Black employees at a plant in Fremont, Calif.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board also found Tesla allegedly unlawfully interrogated and threatened workers over suspected union campaigns.\n\nThe loss of one of the key financial benefits of working for Twitter — stock — is unlikely to help matters.\n\n“Elon aside, can anyone explain to me how Twitter will hire/keep employees since there isn’t company stock to create competitive comp packages? A significant part of our pay is in RSUs,” on employee asked Tuesday.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/MuskElon_42622_AP.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:19'}

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:11'}

Only a quarter of respondents said they thought that Musk would make Twitter a better place, just ten per cent thought Twitter content moderation practices are too strict, and just over a third said Twitter\'s algorithms should be open sourced. The majority did say they wanted spam bots eliminated, and to be able to edit tweets after posting – two changes Musk has pledged to enact.\n\nThe mood inside Twitter is one of uncertainty: employees say they\'ve been left in the dark, and are worried that a stock buyout will lead to long-term financial losses for some Twitter employees, many of whom make 50 per cent of their income on stock options.\n\nAnalyst opinions are also uncertain what sort of financial impact the sale will have on Twitter itself, which stands to lose a good chunk of its revenue to Musk\'s loans: it\'ll likely cost the company around $1 billion per year in debt servicing costs – see the Twitter thread below – and it recorded $5.08 billion revenue in 2021. ®\n\nTwitter will have about $1 billion in interest payments due annually after this buyout – and its cash flows are projected to be about $1.43 billion this year and $1.85 billion in 2023.

Wall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers.\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9% stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. rose more than 5% Monday to $51.70 per share. On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share. While the stock is up sharply since Musk made his offer, it is well below the high of $77 per share it reached in February 2021.\n\nMusk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has proposed relaxing Twitter content restrictions — such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump’s account — while ridding the platform of fake “spambot” accounts and shifting away advertising as its primary revenue model. Musk believes he can increase revenue through subscriptions that give paying customers a better experience — possibly even an ad-free version of Twitter.\n\nAsked during a recent TED interview if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he’d be “very reluctant” to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company’s rules.\n\nIt won’t be perfect, Musk added, “but I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible.”\n\nAfter the deal was announced, the NAACP released a statement urging Musk not to allow Trump, the 45th president, back onto the platform.\n\n“Do not allow 45 to return to the platform,” the civil rights organization said in a statement. “Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy.”\n\nAs both candidate and president, Trump made Twitter a powerful megaphone for speaking directly to the public, often using incendiary and divisive language on hot-button issues. He was permanently banned from the service in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisers, currently Twitter’s main customers, have also pushed for the stronger content rules Musk has criticized. Keeping them happy requires moderation limiting hate speech so that brands aren’t trying to promote their products next to “calls for genocide,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.\n\n“If Musk either fires or drives away the team at Twitter that’s committed to keeping it clean and making it less hate-filled, he’ll see an immediate drop in user activity,” said Vaidhyanathan. “I think he’s going to find pretty fast that inviting the bigots back in is bad for business.”\n\nSome users said Monday that they were planning to quit the platform if Musk took it over. To which he responded on Twitter: “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nMusk has also run into trouble with federal officials as a result of his own tweets, some of which he’s used to taunt regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting. More recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition.\n\nWhile Twitter’s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as Facebook and TikTok, the service is popular with celebrities, world leaders, journalists and intellectuals. Musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts.\n\nLast week, he said in SEC documents that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in Tesla, the electric-vehicle company he runs.\n\nMusk has a fortune of nearly $268 billion, much of which is tied up in Tesla stock and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It’s unclear how much cash Musk holds.\n\nMusk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, to Compaq for $307 million. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly. It was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nThat same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting NASA’s interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets.\n\nIn 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to astronomical success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles.\n\nMusk’s pledge to make Twitter a haven for free speech could dim the appeal of Donald Trump’s troubled Truth Social app, which the former president has touted as a competitor to Twitter that would cater to conservatives. Truth Social is part of Trump’s new media company, which has agreed to be taken public by Digital World Acquisition Corp.

For others who worry that Musk will give free rein to agitators who spew hate, lies and other harmful content, making the platform too toxic for advertisers and average users, Musk has offered few assurances.\n\n“The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all,” he tweeted Tuesday\n\nMany of Musk’s proposed changes reflect his own experience as a high-profile and outspoken Twitter user with more than 85 million followers and a swarm of pesky impersonator accounts that use his name and photo to promote cryptocurrency schemes. The statement announcing his acquisition of Twitter on Monday highlighted the need to defeat “spam bots” that mimic real users.\n\nBut what about Twitter’s more than 200 million other users who aren’t getting banned or flooded with spam? There’s still a lot of uncertainty about whether his ideas are technologically feasible and whether these changes would benefit most regular users, or serve some other purpose.\n\n“He’s made it pretty clear he’s not interested in making Twitter a profitable enterprise," said Joan Donovan, who studies misinformation at Harvard University. “It’s about the power and the influence of Twitter itself and its importance in our culture."\n\nExperts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter for years have expressed doubt that Musk knows exactly what he is getting into. And some of the problems he has identified aren\'t felt by most users.\n\n“The spam bots, for him, are highly visible and somewhat personal,” said Donovan. “Most people don’t see a lot of these spammy accounts.”\n\nAnd for those unhappy with the company\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation, there are plenty of fledgling examples of “free speech”-focused social media platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter antidotes, largely by conservatives. Many have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n“This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power,” said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. “I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter’s values.”\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk’s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n“This platform is pretty much the same one we’ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You’ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they’ve had trouble. It’s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway.”\n\nBut others familiar with Twitter say they\'re dismayed at Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n“Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform,” said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n“I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting,” Miley said. “He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter.”\n\nThe more hands-off approach to content moderation that Musk envisions has many users concerned that the platform will reanimate accounts that propagated dangerous conspiracies and harassment.\n\nWall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers — Twitter\'s chief revenue source. And it could make it harder to retain the San Francisco-based company\'s more than 7,500 employees, some of whom are already voicing concerns about the possibility of a backslide on content standards.\n\nIn Europe, officials reminded Musk about a new law, the Digital Services Act, that will force tech companies to step up policing of their online platforms.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules – regardless of their shareholding,” tweeted Thierry Breton, the European Union commissioner in charge of the bloc’s internal market. “Mr. Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMusk’s takeover is not yet a done deal and still awaits the approval of a majority of Twitter\'s stockholders. Twitter previously scheduled its annual shareholders meeting for May 25, but a regulatory filing Tuesday said the company will be convening a special meeting “as promptly as reasonably practicable."\n\nWhile there are likely to be some bumps along the way, there don\'t appear to be serious enough obstacles to stop the deal, according to Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\n\nTwitter or Musk can walk away from the deal if it’s not completed by Oct. 24, but if either Musk or Twitter is deemed responsible for the deal not going forward, they would have to pay a $1 billion termination fee, according to details of the transaction contained in a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The filing also showed that Twitter will drop a “poison pill” measure it had earlier adopted to defend against Musk\'s takeover by making it prohibitively expensive.\n\nNormally when companies go private, dissenting shareholders are forcibly cashed out. Some could challenge the stock price in court, contending that Musk should pay more, but that probably won’t hold up the sale, Elson said.\n\nIt’s likely that Musk would dissolve the current board and replace it with a new one that would agree with his management direction. And once Twitter is private, Musk will face fewer gripes from shareholders that often bring lawsuits, Elson said. Private companies also don’t face as much scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been a finger in Musk’s eye for years, often because of statements he\'s made on Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, shares of Twitter traded just under $50, below the $54.20 purchase price. Twitter will offer a glimpse into the health of its business when it reports its quarterly financial results Thursday.\n\nTwitter\'s constituents aren\'t the only ones anxious about Musk\'s $44 billion investment.\n\nShares of Musk\'s electric car company, Tesla, have lost about 19% of their value since Musk announced his stake in Twitter, including about a 12% decline on Tuesday. Analysts say investors are fearful that Musk will be distracted by the social media company and less engaged in running Tesla.\n\n“He’s going to be spending more time with another venture,” Edward Jones Senior Equity Analyst Jeff Windau said of Musk, who also runs SpaceX, The Boring Co., which digs tunnels, and Neuralink, a computer-brain interface company. “There’s a potential limit on the amount of bandwidth that you can apply to each of these companies."\n\n——\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

They may also reveal clues as to how Musk will govern the platform he hopes to own.\n\n“Look at the feed: It\'s all over the place. It\'s erratic. At times it\'s pretty extreme,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media and who recently assigned Musk\'s tweets as reading material for their students. “It paints him as some sort of rebel leader who will take control of the public square to save it. That is a myth he has constructed.”\n\nMusk joined Twitter in 2010 and now has more than 85 million followers — the seventh most of any account and the highest for any business leader. He had mused about buying the site before he agreed on Monday to pay $44 billion for Twitter, which he said he hopes to turn into a haven where all speech is allowed.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk wrote in a tweet.\n\nAs the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk uses his Twitter account to make business announcements and promote his enterprises. He muses about technology and trade, but has also posted jokes about women\'s breasts and once compared Canada\'s prime minister to Hitler. He regularly weighs in on global events, as he did in March 2020 when he tweeted that “The coronavirus pandemic is dumb."\n\nHe\'s also used the account to punch back at critics, such as when he called a diver working to rescue boys trapped in a cave in Thailand a “pedo," short for pedophile. The diver had previously criticized Musk\'s proposal to use a sub to rescue the boys. Musk, who won a defamation suit filed by the diver, later said he never intended “pedo” to be interpreted as “pedophile.”\n\nA few years ago, after software engineer Cher Scarlett criticized Musk\'s handling of the cave incident, the tech billionaire fired back and she was soon being harassed by dozens of Musk\'s online fans. He later deleted the posts, but not before Scarlett had to lock down her account because she was receiving so many hateful messages.\n\n“It\'s ironic to me that somebody who claims they want to buy Twitter to protect free speech has such thin skin,” she said. “He\'s a very smart man, and when he replies to people that criticize him, he knows what he\'s doing. To me that\'s not championing free speech, it\'s weaponizing free speech, and I think that\'s what he\'ll do owning this platform.”\n\nNineteen-year-old Jack Sweeney got Musk\'s attention when he created an automated Twitter account that tracked the movements of Musk\'s jet. Musk responded by offering Sweeney $5,000 to pull the account. When Sweeney refused, Musk blocked him on Twitter.\n\nSweeney said he\'s worried he may get kicked off the site entirely if Musk\'s takeover is approved. But he said he likes Musk\'s free speech absolutism, and hopes he sees it through.\n\n“He’ll make it more open, and I think that\'s a good thing,” Sweeney said.\n\nMusk\'s use of Twitter has also led to problems for his own companies. In one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting.\n\nMore recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition.\n\nLast year another federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, ordered Musk to delete a tweet that officials said illegally threatened to cut stock options for Tesla employees who joined the United Auto Workers union.\n\nThose tweets helped cement Musk\'s reputation as a brash outsider, a workingman\'s billionaire, Grygiel said. But that doesn\'t mean he is equipped to run a social media platform with more than 200 million users, the professor added.\n\n“Maybe he wants to burn it down,” Grygiel said. “I don\'t know. But I do know that it shows that no one person should have this kind of power.”', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:46'}

Melber warns that Elon Musk might actually use Twitter to “secretly ban” or “turn down the reach” of a political party or candidate. That is apparently worse than Twitter openly banning candidates and suspending accounts of conservatives for years. Melber is warning the left that Twitter could be used against them . . . the way it has been used against their opponents. He emphasized “this thing matters a ton.” That is a ton more than it mattered for the last six years.\n\nMelber warned his viewers that\n\n“If you own all of Twitter or Facebook or what have you, you don’t have to explain yourself, you don’t even have to be transparent, you could secretly ban one party’s candidate or all of its candidates, all of it nominees. Or you could just secretly turn down the reach of their stuff and turn up the reach of something else and the rest of us might not even find about it til after the election.”\n\nThat is precisely what Twitter has been doing without a whimper of objection from most pundits on the left.\n\nMelber actually warns that Musk might secretly ban political figures while warning that Donald Trump will have his ban lifted by Musk. While Trump said that he will not return to Twitter, Melber is worried that he could be allowed to tweet again.\n\nNone of this was a threat to democracy when Twitter was suspending dozens of political figures and commentators, including the President of the United States.\n\nHowever, now it is dire as Musk threatens to restore free speech protections to the platform:\n\n“It’s true if you are a democracy like the United States that used to regulate media ownership and say Rupert Murdoch can’t have too many local TV stations and newspapers in one town, they have laws for that are still on the books. Congress hasn’t gotten round to limiting whether someone can own all of Twitter.”\n\nSo media figures are calling for government regulation of media after the first major victory against corporate censorship. Musk may prove a fraud or he prove a champion of free speech. Yet, it is hard to see the downside given the massive censorship system now imposed across social media. There remain media figures who would prefer censorship to the outbreak of free speech.\n\nIt seems that, when it comes to free speech, there are simply some people you cannot reach.', 'image': 'http://img.youtube.com/vi/lAR2GCCzB7k/0.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:29'}

"Theoretically, this means that [Musk] could access your DMs. And for businesses that could pose a threat."\n\nYet there\'s also plenty of reason to believe that Twitter might not change much, particularly in the short-term, as a result of Musk\'s buyout of the company. Unless Musk fires huge numbers of employees and replaces them, the people who make key decisions on content policy and moderation will still be there.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to see how this will be better or worse for users than a bunch of shareholders having control over the company," York said.\n\nMoreover, it\'s difficult to see how Musk could accomplish some of the expressed goals he outlined in today\'s statement, she added.\n\n"Going after bots and misinformation is a hard thing to do," she said. "So I think … he\'s going to hit a really hard problem when he tries to deal with it."\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed transaction, expected to occur by the end of the year and subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter\'s closing stock price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk publicly disclosed an approximately 9% stake in Twitter, the company said. After that disclosure, Musk publicly offered to buy Twitter, and initially the company appeared ready to rebuff the offer — it adopted a so-called "poison pill" stricture, which holds that if any person or group acquires ownership of at least 15% of Twitter’s outstanding common stock without the board’s approval, other shareholders would be allowed to purchase additional shares at a discount.\n\nUlitmately though, the board agreed to the offer.\n\n"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\'s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter\'s stockholders," said Bret Taylor, Twitter\'s independent board chair, in a company statement.\n\nTo close the deal, Musk secured $25.5 billion of debt and margin loan financing, and is committing approximately $21.0 billion in cash.', 'image': 'https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2022/04/06/14/twitter-3319619-1-100923738-large.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85,70', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:10'}

Twitter independent board chair Bret Taylor described the deal as “the best path forward” for the company’s shareholders.\n\nThe result ends prolonged speculation over Musk’s financial interest in Twitter. On April 4, the entrepreneur’s 9.2 percent stake in the company—or 73.5 million shares at a cost of around $2.4 billion—was disclosed to the public. At the time, the purchase of stock in Twitter came with an offer to sit on the board—though on April 10 Musk declined to take his seat.\n\nHe soon made it obvious that he wanted the whole thing. On April 14, Musk offered to buy the remaining percentage of the company for $54.20 per share—a 38 percent premium on the price he paid for his initial investment. Musk’s accompanying letter to the chair of Twitter’s board was strident in its criticism of the platform. “I believe in [Twitter’s] potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” he wrote. However, he added, “I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.”\n\nInstead, he wanted to take the company private, offering $44 billion for it in a “best and final” offer. At the time, analysts were split about the likelihood of Musk’s bid succeeding, and whether it was good value; while it sat in the middle of the usual 30 to 40 percent premium above the trading price, the stock price had reached well above that just last year. Twitter’s board, for its part, said it would evaluate the offer.\n\n“He’s setting a bit of a precedent for activists that will go after a company,” says Timothy Galpin, senior lecturer in strategy and innovation at the Said Business School at the University of Oxford. “It’s been done a bit before by Carl Icahn and a few others, but it’s not as prevalent to go after the whole company.”\n\nOn the same day that he lodged his bid to take over the entirety of Twitter and take it private, Musk appeared at a TED talk in Vancouver, where he laid out his vision. “This is not a way to sort of make money,” he claimed. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important.” That gave some within Twitter, and those who held large shares in the platform, pause.\n\nContemporary reports indicated Twitter would fight to repel Musk, while the Tesla and Space X CEO got into a Twitter spat about press freedom with Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Company, a major shareholder that said it would reject Musk’s offer.

The Tesla CEO agreed to buy Twitter in a deal that values the company at about $44 billion.\n\nA Musk-run Twitter would undercut the rationale for Truth Social, which Trump had promised would “stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.” There is even speculation that Twitter, under Musk’s control, could lift the ban on Trump himself.\n\nTrump weighed in on the issue on Monday, telling Fox News he will not return to Twitter despite Musk’s takeover.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump told Fox News. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”\n\nBelow $36, the implied valuation of Trump Media & Technology Group has tumbled to roughly $7.7 billion, according to Kennedy of Renaissance Capital. That’s down sharply from around $13 billion before Musk disclosed his Twitter investment.\n\n“While the market apparently believes that a Twitter owned by Elon Musk dims the outlook of Truth Social, Trump still has some financial incentives to use Truth,” Kennedy said.\n\nBeyond Musk’s efforts to acquire Twitter, the Trump SPAC has been hurt by the slow start of Truth Social. As CNN reported earlier this month, Truth Social has been plagued by a lengthy waitlist, a lack of content and high-profile contents that appear to be bots.\n\nAt the same time, federal regulators are investigating the Trump SPAC deal and legal experts have told CNN that securities regulators could slow or even derail the merger altogether.\n\nSince hitting a 2022 high of $101.87 on March 2, Digital World is down by about 65%.', 'image': 'https://www.siliconvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hypatia-h_966261470293a8a1f93e0f1c60a617b0-h_3b2f0a435c1f422f2276b67d7f2909d3.jpg?w=1024&h=711', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:54'}

Will banned users return?\n\nMusk has laid out a more relaxed vision for content moderation that would lean toward temporary “timeouts” over permanent bans.\n\nAdvocacy groups are concerned that this switch could reverse Twitter’s permanent bans on public figures and politicians — including former President Trump.\n\n2. Leadership changes: While Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n3. How could the product change?: Major changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n4. Washington’s ire: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech.”\n\n5. How will Twitter’s workers respond?: Twitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCOVID ABSENCES FURTHER DELAY FTC VOTE\n\nThe vote on Alvaro Bedoya’s nomination to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to be further delayed due to COVID-19 linked absences in the Senate, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide.\n\nSens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Vice President Harris all tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans have broadly pushed back on Bedoya’s nomination to the FTC, leaving Democrats in need of all senators and Harris present to secure his confirmation.\n\nThe Senate aide said absent to an objection by Republicans, the Senate is expected to delay the consideration of Bedoya to a later date.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee advanced Bedoya in a vote along party lines in March, after delays based on Sen. Ben Ray Luján’s (D-N.M.) absence while he recovered from a stroke.\n\nAs he awaits confirmation, the FTC remains split along party lines, thwarting Democrats from pushing forward with their full agenda.\n\nEU WARNS MUSK\n\nThierry Breton, the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market, tweeted Tuesday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who just secured a deal to buy Twitter, will have to comply with the commission’s rules on moderation.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules — regardless of their shareholding,” Breton tweeted. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\n“He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nBITS AND PIECES\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Elon Musk’s Twitter purchase brings free speech into sharp focus\n\nLighter click: happy carrot time\n\nNotable links from around the web:\n\nWhat Elon Musk’s battles with Washington might mean for Twitter (Politico / Emily Birnbaum)\n\nHow to Become a MAGA Rap Kingpin (Without Believing What You’re Saying) (Rolling Stone / Alice Hines)\n\nFacebook Doesn’t Know What It Does With Your Data, Or Where It Goes: Leaked Document (Motherboard / Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai)\n\nOne last thing: Truth Social struggles\n\nShares that are tied with the company funding former President Trump’s latest social media venture, Truth Social, took a dive on Monday after social media platform Twitter announced its deal with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nCNBC reported that Digital World Acquisition Corp.’s shares fell to nearly 13 percent on Monday, bringing the company’s year-to-date losses to more than 30 percent.\n\nTruth Social, which officially launched in February, was created by Trump after he was permanently banned from multiple social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram for actions involving the Jan.6 insurrection at the Capitol, CNBC noted.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

In a recent TED interview, the billionaire said he’d like to see Twitter err on the side of allowing speech instead of moderating it. He said he’d be “very reluctant” to delete tweets and would generally be cautious about permanent bans. He also acknowledged that Twitter would have to abide by national laws governing speech in markets around the world.\n\nMusk himself, though, regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and has used the platform to bully reporters who have written critical articles about him or his company.\n\nTwitter’s board at first enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But when Musk outlined the financial commitments he’d lined up to back his offer of $46.5 billion — and no other bidders emerged — the board opened negotiations with him.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nElon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter is gaining steam and could be announced as early as Monday, according to media reports about the social media company\'s late-stage negotiations with the Tesla CEO, who has offered more than $40 billion to privatize the platform and pledged to be more lenient when it comes to policing users\' speech.\n\nTwitter and Musk spoke Sunday and into the early hours Monday, The New York Times reported, less than two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform that he uses to promote his interests, attack critics and opine on social and economic issues to his more than 83 million followers.\n\nMusk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal. Musk hasn\'t commented on the negotiations but on Monday waded into the buzz about them on Twitter, where some users are promising to quit the platform if he takes over.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he tweeted.\n\nMusk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has voiced a number of proposed changes for the company, from relaxing its content restrictions — such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump’s account — to ridding the platform of fake and automated accounts, and shifting away from its advertising-based revenue model.\n\nTwitter’s board has flexibility in judging Musk’s proposal not just on the finances but also the specifics of his business plan and how it could affect users, advertisers and employees — some of whom might leave, said Kevin Kaiser, a finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“What’s critical for the board is whether they think it’s in the best interest of the company,” Kaiser said. “That can come from many, many factors.”\n\nKaiser said the board could decide that Musk’s plan has “too many negative impacts,” but that would be a hard case to make given how much Musk is offering to pay.\n\nAsked during a recent TED talk if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter or any forum is “obviously bound by the laws of the country that it operates in. So obviously there are some limitations on free speech in the US, and, of course, Twitter would have to abide by those rules.”\n\nBeyond that, though, he said he’d be “very reluctant” to delete things and in general be cautious about permanent bans.\n\nIt won’t be perfect, Musk added, “but I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible."\n\nTwitter had initially enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But the board decided to negotiate after Musk updated his proposal last week to show he had secured financing, according to The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the negotiations were underway.\n\nA rival bidder to Musk may not be stepping up any time soon, fearful of the byzantine task of moderating content on the platform, something that Musk has vowed to do less of.\n\n“The Twitter Board could not find a white knight and with Musk’s financing detailed the clock has essentially struck midnight for the board which is why negotiations have begun to get a deal done,” said Dan Ives, who follows Twitter for Wedbush Securities.\n\nThe Times, citing people with knowledge of the situation who it did not identify, said the two sides were discussing details including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart. The people said the situation was fluid and fast-moving.\n\nWhile Twitter’s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as Facebook and TikTok, the service is popular with celebrities, world leaders, journalists and intellectuals. Musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. rose 5% Monday to $51.50 per share. On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy the social media platform for $54.20 per share, or about $43 billion, but did not say at the time how he would finance the acquisition.\n\nLast week, he said in documents filed with U.S. securities regulators that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in Tesla.\n\nTwitter has not commented.\n\nMusk is the world’s wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a nearly $279 billion fortune. But much of his money is tied up in Tesla stock — he owns about 17% of the electric car company, according to FactSet, which is valued at more than $1 trillion — and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It’s unclear how much cash Musk has.\n\nMusk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, to Compaq for $307 million. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly. It was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nThat same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting NASA’s interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets.\n\nIn 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to astronomical success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles.\n\n——\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

The electric car maker is currently valued at $1 trillion -- roughly 25 times more than Twitter.\n\n“I think there is nothing better for Twitter than Elon Musk buying it and ideally replacing the board, and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue-generating sources," said John Meyer, a technology entrepreneur and investor. “Musk has the track record that he can do the impossible."\n\nIt would be easy to see why other Twitter shareholders might welcome a shake-up, as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment. Before Musk disclosed his 9% stake in Twitter earlier this month, the shares were trading below $40 — not that much more it its $26 price when Twitter went public in November 2013. Since then, the tech-driven Nasdaq has more than tripled, even after a recent downturn. Twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising, Google and Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla’s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010. And after struggling to make money for more than a decade, the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of $3.3 billion during the first three months of this year alone.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nAs is customary once a company agrees to be acquired, the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren’t any red flags that haven’t come up via the company’s public filings.\n\nThis step in the process isn’t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal, said Angelo Zino, tech analyst at CFRA.\n\n“He’s acquiring this company, not from a financial perspective,” Zino said. “He’s going to do what he wants with it and he’s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company.”\n\nWHAT SAY COULD REGULATORS HAVE?\n\nLast year, Twitter generated $5 billion in revenue, with $2.8 billion from the U.S. and the rest earned overseas, Zino said. The Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., or the European Commission in the EU, are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed Twitter buyout.\n\nThe main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry, or whether it violates antitrust laws.\n\nThese reviews can take months, or longer, but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining, or in the case of a single buyer, whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry.\n\nNeither Tesla, nor Musk’s other company, Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, are social media platforms, so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal, analysts said.\n\n“We do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with Musk owning Twitter,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Monday.\n\nWHEN DO SHAREHOLDERS GET TO VOTE?\n\nThe deal is expected to close in 2022, subject to the approval of Twitter shareholders. Twitter hasn’t announced the timing of a shareholder vote, though the company’s annual meeting is set for May 25, which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders.\n\nA company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time, even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TWITTER LEADERSHIP?\n\nAt this early stage, it’s unclear what will happen to Twitter\'s current board or management team if the deal is completed, but Musk has made it abundantly clear that he believes the company has been poorly run. That assessment is a strong indication that Musk’s makeover will also include a purge of Twitter’s top ranks.', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:56'}

The situation involving Twitter and Mr. Musk remains fluid and fast-moving, the people with knowledge of the situation said.\n\nMr. Musk, who has more than 83 million followers on Twitter and began amassing shares in the company earlier this year, declared his intent to buy the company on April 14 and take it private.

In a securities filing that was made public on Thursday, Mr. Musk detailed how he had put together financing from the investment bank Morgan Stanley and a group of other lenders, which were offering $13 billion in debt financing, plus another $12.5 billion in loans against his stock in Tesla, the electric carmaker that he runs. He said he would use another $21 billion in cash to buy the rest of Twitter’s equity.\n\nA Twitter spokesman declined to comment. In previous public statements, the company had said its board was “continuing to conduct a careful, comprehensive and deliberate review to determine the course of action in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders.”\n\nMr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

Just a few weeks after announcing his bid for Twitter, Elon Musk has entered a “definitive agreement” to purchase full ownership of the company.

He quickly decided to take the whole company, citing his disappointment in how Twitter handles “free speech” and spam. He’s also expressed interest in making Twitter open-source, which would spawn clones of the website and make third-party extensions easier to develop.\n\nDespite some clapback on social media and a poison pill anti-buyout strategy from Twitter’s leadership, Elon Musk’s plan worked. This deal is simply too lucrative for shareholders to ignore—at a price of $54.20 per share, Musk is purchasing the stock at a nearly 40% premium.\n\nAny changes that Musk will make to Twitter are unknown. But the new CEO will likely focus on spam (his threads are full of replies from bot accounts) and whatever he perceives as free speech. We may also see a restructuring within the company; Musk is pretty hands-on with his businesses, and of course, he’s constantly using Twitter while constantly criticizing the platform.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has a lot in common with Elon Musk.

Dorsey actually stepped down from Twitter last year to focus on cryptocurrency at Square (now called Block), his banking and sales company.\n\nI guess we’ll have to wait and see what the epic memelord does with his new toy.

We are open but on our conditions. At least we know what to tell him: ‘Elon, there are rules. You are welcome but these are our rules. It’s not your rules which will apply here.’”\n\nMusk’s take-private deal for Twitter could transform the Tesla chief executive, who has used the platform to attack regulators and critics, into a social media baron, given that millions of people rely on the San Francisco-based platform for news.\n\nHe said on Monday that “free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy” and described Twitter as “the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.”\n\nThe comments from Breton, one of Europe’s most influential digital regulators, come just days after Brussels signed off on a new piece of legislation that will force Big Tech to more aggressively police content online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn pitching his offer for Twitter, Musk outlined plans to loosen the social media platform’s content moderation policies, describing himself as a “free speech absolutist.” Republican politicians in the US are hopeful that the deal could pave the way for Donald Trump to return to Twitter, after the former president was banned for repeatedly breaching its rules around hate speech and misinformation.\n\nBut Breton said he wanted to offer a “reality check” to Musk’s plans for less stringent moderation.

Subsequent events put that moniker to the test, as repressive regimes cracked down on Twitter users, particularly in the wake of the short-lived “Arab Spring” demonstrations. In the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums.\n\nOver the subsequent years, Twitter learned a few things about the consequences of running a largely unmoderated social platform — one of the most important being that companies generally don't want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement, and misinformation that aims to tip elections or undermine public health.\n\n“With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself,” said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. “If you stop moderating with automated systems and human reviews, a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool.”\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the “health” of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the “report abuse” button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy’s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invested in staff and technology that detect violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violates its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used their platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies also stepped up their efforts against political misinformation.\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk, who describes himself as a “free-speech absolutist,” wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nEven now, Americans say they’re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a “fair or poor” job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.\n\nMeanwhile, terms like “censorship” and “free speech” have turned into political rallying cries for conservatives, frustrated by seeing right-leaning commentators and high-profile Republican officials booted off Facebook and Twitter for violating their rules.\n\nMusk appeared to criticize Twitter’s permanent ban of President Donald Trump last year for messages that the tech company said helped incite the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last year.\n\n“A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech,” Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nTrump’s allies, including his son Donald Trump Jr., have even pleaded for Musk to buy out the company.\n\n“If Elon Musk can privately send people into space I’m sure he can design a social network that isn’t biased,” Trump Jr. said in the caption of a video posted to Instagram last April.\n\nKirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame, said Twitter has consistently worked at being a “responsible” social media company through its moderation system, its hires in the area of machine learning ethics and in whom they allow to do research on the platform. The fact that Musk wants to change that, she added, suggests that he's focused on “irresponsible social media.”\n\nTwitter declined to comment for this story. A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to a message for comment.\n\nNew social media apps targeted at conservatives, including Trump’s Truth Social, haven't come remotely close to matching the success of Facebook or Twitter. That's partly because Republican politicians, politicians and causes already draw large audiences on existing, and much better established, platforms.\n\nIt's also partly due to floods of inflammatory, false or violent posts. Last year, for example, right-wing social media site Parler was nearly wiped off the internet when it became evident that rioters had used the app to promote violent messages and organize the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol. Apple and Google barred its app from their online stores, while Amazon stopped providing web-hosting services for the site.\n\nMusk himself regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and sometimes bullies reporters who have written critical articles about him or Tesla. He regularly tweets at reporters who write about his company, sometimes mischaracterizing their work as “false” or “misleading.”\n\nHis popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of the reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\n“I only block people as a direct insult,” Musk tweeted in 2020, responding to a tweet from a reporter.\n\nEvan Greer, a political activist with Fight for the Future, said Musk’s lack of experience in moderating an influential social media platform will be a problem if he successfully takes over the company.\n\n“If we want to protect free speech online, then we can’t live in a world where the richest person on Earth can just purchase a platform that millions of people depend on and then change the rules to his liking,” Greer said.", 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:34'}

The race to the bottom begins,” Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning Media Matters for America, said in a statement.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), using her official account, suggested that after Musk “seals the deal” she will get access to her personal account “restored” after it was banned in January for repeated violations of Twitter’s COVID-19 misinformation policy.\n\nTrump said Monday he would not return to Twitter but would remain on his own platform, Truth Social. However, some of Trump’s advisers told The Washington Post they don’t think he would turn down an offer to return to the platform that brought him so much attention during his campaign and term.\n\nMedia Matters compiled a list of banned Twitter users, including Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander and prominent QAnon figures celebrating Musk’s takeover, that critics believe could pose a threat if allowed back on the platform.\n\n“These folks are organized,” said Jessica González, co-CEO of Free Press and co-founder of Change the Terms.\n\n“I’m really talking about sophisticated, coordinated … efforts to use these platforms to radicalize people, to raise funds, to normalize violence and to issue calls to action for violent and threatening activity that happens in real life,” she added.\n\nLeadership changes\n\nWhile Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n“I think we feel very comfortable that [the deal] gives this team the ability to continue to make the company successful in between signing and closing the transaction,” Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter’s board of directors, reportedly said during a company-wide town hall Monday evening.\n\nOnce the deal is closed however, a shakeup at the top of the company seems likely.\n\nMusk’s relationship with current leadership has not been publicly confrontational. But Musk did reject their offer to join the board, an indication that he might be interested in pursuing his own vision of the platform.\n\nAgrawal will be in line for a $38.7 million pay package if the deal goes through and Musk chooses to terminate him.\n\nIt would be difficult for Musk to head the company alone given his active leadership or involvement in Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink.\n\nWhom Musk chooses to head Twitter if he refreshes current leadership could be the clearest signal of his plans for the platform.\n\n“Once the deal closes, we don’t know which direction the platform will go,” Agrawal reportedly admitted during Monday’s town hall.\n\nHow could the product change?\n\nMajor changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n“I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,” he said in a statement on the deal’s announcement.\n\nMusk has said that algorithms that make recommendations to users on what accounts to follow, posts to view or topics to read up on should be opened to public viewing.\n\nSuch a move could assuage concerns about political bias on the platform and give researchers much-needed access to social media’s levers.\n\nBut Twitter has already been very open about the effect of its algorithms. The company released a study in the fall finding that they tend to amplify right-leaning politicians more than their counterparts.\n\nFully publishing complex algorithms could not only lead to confusion, but open the platform up to cybersecurity risks.\n\nMusk has been very vocal about his desire to cut down on spam on Twitter but has given few specifics about how he would do.\n\nMusk’s proposal to authenticate all humans on Twitter has also prompted worry from civil society groups.\n\nSimple checks like CAPTCHAs before posting would likely be gameable with spam bots, while more stringent checks like ID verification would destroy the pseudonymity that Twitter has worked hard to maintain.\n\nEven if users are not required to post their real names on the platform, that data will have to be collected by Twitter and, therefore, could be compelled by governments to turn it over.\n\nThe impacts on free speech and the right to protest, especially in authoritarian states that already have rules against government criticism on social media, could be devastating.\n\n“There are no easy ways to require verification without wreaking havoc for some users, and for free speech,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in statement.\n\nWashington’s ire\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech overlords.”\n\n“Elon Musk is helping us defeat the Big Tech overlords. Our digital public squares need to be returned to us,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) tweeted.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) echoed Musk’s own words, saying the platform’s “full potential” will be unlocked if Musk can change the platform to “actually protect free speech and encourage open discourse.”\n\nThe GOP support builds on years of attacks on Twitter over claims of the platform censoring content with an anti-conservative bias.\n\nBut Democrats say Musk’s ownership raises additional concerns about the spread of disinformation.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told The Hill.\n\nSome progressives are using Musk’s takeover to push for a wealth tax and elevate concerns about power consolidation.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted.\n\nHow will Twitter’s workers respond?\n\nTwitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\n“Can someone just tell me if I’m rich or fired please,” one said.\n\n“The news today is so crazy I literally forgot I have COVID,” posted another.\n\nThe majority of the company’s 5,000-plus employees work in liberal San Francisco and, until now, have worked for a platform known for its aggressive approach to content moderation.\n\nThe company has led social media competitors in reacting to Trump’s dissemination of election disinformation and the spread of misinformation about COVID-19.\n\nMusk’s version of free speech appears to run counter to that approach, setting up potential ideological clashes.\n\nThe company reportedly took a precautionary measure Monday by temporarily freezing changes to the platform until next week. The move comes after one employee briefly took down Trump’s account several years ago.\n\nMusk also has a less than stellar reputation for the treatment of his employees.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing is in the midst of a lawsuit against Tesla over allegations of racism and harassment toward Black employees at a plant in Fremont, Calif.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board also found Tesla allegedly unlawfully interrogated and threatened workers over suspected union campaigns.\n\nThe loss of one of the key financial benefits of working for Twitter — stock — is unlikely to help matters.\n\n“Elon aside, can anyone explain to me how Twitter will hire/keep employees since there isn’t company stock to create competitive comp packages?

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:11'}

Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it."\n\nAs previously reported, the Tesla and SpaceX supremo financed $21 billion of the deal on his own, and received the rest from the likes of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays.

Only a quarter of respondents said they thought that Musk would make Twitter a better place, just ten per cent thought Twitter content moderation practices are too strict, and just over a third said Twitter\'s algorithms should be open sourced. The majority did say they wanted spam bots eliminated, and to be able to edit tweets after posting – two changes Musk has pledged to enact.\n\nThe mood inside Twitter is one of uncertainty: employees say they\'ve been left in the dark, and are worried that a stock buyout will lead to long-term financial losses for some Twitter employees, many of whom make 50 per cent of their income on stock options.\n\nAnalyst opinions are also uncertain what sort of financial impact the sale will have on Twitter itself, which stands to lose a good chunk of its revenue to Musk\'s loans: it\'ll likely cost the company around $1 billion per year in debt servicing costs – see the Twitter thread below – and it recorded $5.08 billion revenue in 2021. ®\n\nTwitter will have about $1 billion in interest payments due annually after this buyout – and its cash flows are projected to be about $1.43 billion this year and $1.85 billion in 2023.

Wall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers.\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9% stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. rose more than 5% Monday to $51.70 per share. On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share. While the stock is up sharply since Musk made his offer, it is well below the high of $77 per share it reached in February 2021.\n\nMusk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has proposed relaxing Twitter content restrictions — such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump’s account — while ridding the platform of fake “spambot” accounts and shifting away advertising as its primary revenue model. Musk believes he can increase revenue through subscriptions that give paying customers a better experience — possibly even an ad-free version of Twitter.\n\nAsked during a recent TED interview if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he’d be “very reluctant” to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company’s rules.\n\nIt won’t be perfect, Musk added, “but I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible.”\n\nAfter the deal was announced, the NAACP released a statement urging Musk not to allow Trump, the 45th president, back onto the platform.\n\n“Do not allow 45 to return to the platform,” the civil rights organization said in a statement. “Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy.”\n\nAs both candidate and president, Trump made Twitter a powerful megaphone for speaking directly to the public, often using incendiary and divisive language on hot-button issues. He was permanently banned from the service in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisers, currently Twitter’s main customers, have also pushed for the stronger content rules Musk has criticized. Keeping them happy requires moderation limiting hate speech so that brands aren’t trying to promote their products next to “calls for genocide,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.\n\n“If Musk either fires or drives away the team at Twitter that’s committed to keeping it clean and making it less hate-filled, he’ll see an immediate drop in user activity,” said Vaidhyanathan. “I think he’s going to find pretty fast that inviting the bigots back in is bad for business.”\n\nSome users said Monday that they were planning to quit the platform if Musk took it over. To which he responded on Twitter: “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nMusk has also run into trouble with federal officials as a result of his own tweets, some of which he’s used to taunt regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting. More recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition.\n\nWhile Twitter’s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as Facebook and TikTok, the service is popular with celebrities, world leaders, journalists and intellectuals. Musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts.\n\nLast week, he said in SEC documents that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in Tesla, the electric-vehicle company he runs.\n\nMusk has a fortune of nearly $268 billion, much of which is tied up in Tesla stock and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It’s unclear how much cash Musk holds.\n\nMusk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, to Compaq for $307 million. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly. It was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nThat same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting NASA’s interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets.\n\nIn 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to astronomical success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles.\n\nMusk’s pledge to make Twitter a haven for free speech could dim the appeal of Donald Trump’s troubled Truth Social app, which the former president has touted as a competitor to Twitter that would cater to conservatives. Truth Social is part of Trump’s new media company, which has agreed to be taken public by Digital World Acquisition Corp. Shares of DWAC dropped 16.2% Monday and are down 46% since Musk revealed his stake in Twitter.\n\n__\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit. O’Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

Of course, those are the very actions Musk took today.\n\nMusk later posted a December tweet that Bloomberg described as “depict[ing] [Twitter CEO Parag] Agrawal as Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and Dorsey as Soviet secret police head Nikolai Yezhov being shoved into water.” Musk also asked, via tweet, whether his followers believed that Twitter preserved free speech.\n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said in a statement. “I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.”\n\nTwitter will not hold a conference call to announce the move, but will issue its first quarter earnings on April 28.', 'image': 'https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jeremy-bezanger-Jm1YUfYjpHI-unsplash-1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:56'}

Board members started taking Musk\'s offer more seriously after he lined up $46.5 billion in financing. The sale agreement was announced hours after reports that a deal between Twitter and Musk was close.\n\nThe deal is "a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion," the announcement said. "Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company." Twitter\'s stock price was up 5.7 percent today.\n\nBoard cites “thoughtful and comprehensive process”\n\nTwitter Board Chairman Bret Taylor said, "The Twitter board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\'s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing.

Musk previously secured $25.5 billion of debt and margin loan financing and committed to provide $21 billion in equity.\n\nMusk hopes his “worst critics remain on Twitter”\n\n"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means," Musk wrote in a tweet Monday. Musk, who has said that "Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company" to protect free speech, last year asked a college student to take down a Twitter account that tracks the movements of his private jet.\n\nMusk recently purchased 9.2 percent of Twitter\'s stock and agreed to join Twitter\'s board. He then backed out of the board seat deal, which would have prohibited him from buying more than 14.9 percent of the company\'s stock, and offered to buy Twitter instead.\n\nTwitter directors initially seemed ready to fight Musk\'s takeover attempt and unanimously approved the poison pill that makes it difficult to buy more than 15 percent of the company\'s stock in any "transaction not approved by the Board." The poison pill, of course, did not prevent the board from striking a deal with Musk in direct negotiations.', 'image': 'https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/getty-musk-760x380.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:11'}

For others who worry that Musk will give free rein to agitators who spew hate, lies and other harmful content, making the platform too toxic for advertisers and average users, Musk has offered few assurances.\n\n“The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all,” he tweeted Tuesday\n\nMany of Musk’s proposed changes reflect his own experience as a high-profile and outspoken Twitter user with more than 85 million followers and a swarm of pesky impersonator accounts that use his name and photo to promote cryptocurrency schemes. The statement announcing his acquisition of Twitter on Monday highlighted the need to defeat “spam bots” that mimic real users.\n\nBut what about Twitter’s more than 200 million other users who aren’t getting banned or flooded with spam? There’s still a lot of uncertainty about whether his ideas are technologically feasible and whether these changes would benefit most regular users, or serve some other purpose.\n\n“He’s made it pretty clear he’s not interested in making Twitter a profitable enterprise," said Joan Donovan, who studies misinformation at Harvard University. “It’s about the power and the influence of Twitter itself and its importance in our culture."\n\nExperts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter for years have expressed doubt that Musk knows exactly what he is getting into. And some of the problems he has identified aren\'t felt by most users.\n\n“The spam bots, for him, are highly visible and somewhat personal,” said Donovan. “Most people don’t see a lot of these spammy accounts.”\n\nAnd for those unhappy with the company\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation, there are plenty of fledgling examples of “free speech”-focused social media platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter antidotes, largely by conservatives. Many have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n“This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power,” said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. “I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter’s values.”\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk’s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n“This platform is pretty much the same one we’ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You’ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they’ve had trouble. It’s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway.”\n\nBut others familiar with Twitter say they\'re dismayed at Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n“Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform,” said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n“I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting,” Miley said. “He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter.”\n\nThe more hands-off approach to content moderation that Musk envisions has many users concerned that the platform will reanimate accounts that propagated dangerous conspiracies and harassment.\n\nWall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers — Twitter\'s chief revenue source. And it could make it harder to retain the San Francisco-based company\'s more than 7,500 employees, some of whom are already voicing concerns about the possibility of a backslide on content standards.\n\nIn Europe, officials reminded Musk about a new law, the Digital Services Act, that will force tech companies to step up policing of their online platforms.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules – regardless of their shareholding,” tweeted Thierry Breton, the European Union commissioner in charge of the bloc’s internal market. “Mr. Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMusk’s takeover is not yet a done deal and still awaits the approval of a majority of Twitter\'s stockholders. Twitter previously scheduled its annual shareholders meeting for May 25, but a regulatory filing Tuesday said the company will be convening a special meeting “as promptly as reasonably practicable."\n\nWhile there are likely to be some bumps along the way, there don\'t appear to be serious enough obstacles to stop the deal, according to Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\n\nTwitter or Musk can walk away from the deal if it’s not completed by Oct. 24, but if either Musk or Twitter is deemed responsible for the deal not going forward, they would have to pay a $1 billion termination fee, according to details of the transaction contained in a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The filing also showed that Twitter will drop a “poison pill” measure it had earlier adopted to defend against Musk\'s takeover by making it prohibitively expensive.\n\nNormally when companies go private, dissenting shareholders are forcibly cashed out. Some could challenge the stock price in court, contending that Musk should pay more, but that probably won’t hold up the sale, Elson said.\n\nIt’s likely that Musk would dissolve the current board and replace it with a new one that would agree with his management direction. And once Twitter is private, Musk will face fewer gripes from shareholders that often bring lawsuits, Elson said. Private companies also don’t face as much scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been a finger in Musk’s eye for years, often because of statements he\'s made on Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, shares of Twitter traded just under $50, below the $54.20 purchase price. Twitter will offer a glimpse into the health of its business when it reports its quarterly financial results Thursday.\n\nTwitter\'s constituents aren\'t the only ones anxious about Musk\'s $44 billion investment.\n\nShares of Musk\'s electric car company, Tesla, have lost about 19% of their value since Musk announced his stake in Twitter, including about a 12% decline on Tuesday. Analysts say investors are fearful that Musk will be distracted by the social media company and less engaged in running Tesla.\n\n“He’s going to be spending more time with another venture,” Edward Jones Senior Equity Analyst Jeff Windau said of Musk, who also runs SpaceX, The Boring Co., which digs tunnels, and Neuralink, a computer-brain interface company. “There’s a potential limit on the amount of bandwidth that you can apply to each of these companies."\n\n——\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

They may also reveal clues as to how Musk will govern the platform he hopes to own.\n\n“Look at the feed: It\'s all over the place. It\'s erratic. At times it\'s pretty extreme,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media and who recently assigned Musk\'s tweets as reading material for their students. “It paints him as some sort of rebel leader who will take control of the public square to save it. That is a myth he has constructed.”\n\nMusk joined Twitter in 2010 and now has more than 85 million followers — the seventh most of any account and the highest for any business leader. He had mused about buying the site before he agreed on Monday to pay $44 billion for Twitter, which he said he hopes to turn into a haven where all speech is allowed.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk wrote in a tweet.\n\nAs the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk uses his Twitter account to make business announcements and promote his enterprises. He muses about technology and trade, but has also posted jokes about women\'s breasts and once compared Canada\'s prime minister to Hitler. He regularly weighs in on global events, as he did in March 2020 when he tweeted that “The coronavirus pandemic is dumb."\n\nHe\'s also used the account to punch back at critics, such as when he called a diver working to rescue boys trapped in a cave in Thailand a “pedo," short for pedophile. The diver had previously criticized Musk\'s proposal to use a sub to rescue the boys. Musk, who won a defamation suit filed by the diver, later said he never intended “pedo” to be interpreted as “pedophile.”\n\nA few years ago, after software engineer Cher Scarlett criticized Musk\'s handling of the cave incident, the tech billionaire fired back and she was soon being harassed by dozens of Musk\'s online fans. He later deleted the posts, but not before Scarlett had to lock down her account because she was receiving so many hateful messages.\n\n“It\'s ironic to me that somebody who claims they want to buy Twitter to protect free speech has such thin skin,” she said. “He\'s a very smart man, and when he replies to people that criticize him, he knows what he\'s doing. To me that\'s not championing free speech, it\'s weaponizing free speech, and I think that\'s what he\'ll do owning this platform.”\n\nNineteen-year-old Jack Sweeney got Musk\'s attention when he created an automated Twitter account that tracked the movements of Musk\'s jet. Musk responded by offering Sweeney $5,000 to pull the account. When Sweeney refused, Musk blocked him on Twitter.\n\nSweeney said he\'s worried he may get kicked off the site entirely if Musk\'s takeover is approved. But he said he likes Musk\'s free speech absolutism, and hopes he sees it through.\n\n“He’ll make it more open, and I think that\'s a good thing,” Sweeney said.\n\nMusk\'s use of Twitter has also led to problems for his own companies. In one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting.\n\nMore recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition.\n\nLast year another federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, ordered Musk to delete a tweet that officials said illegally threatened to cut stock options for Tesla employees who joined the United Auto Workers union.\n\nThose tweets helped cement Musk\'s reputation as a brash outsider, a workingman\'s billionaire, Grygiel said. But that doesn\'t mean he is equipped to run a social media platform with more than 200 million users, the professor added.\n\n“Maybe he wants to burn it down,” Grygiel said. “I don\'t know. But I do know that it shows that no one person should have this kind of power.”', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:46'}

Melber warns that Elon Musk might actually use Twitter to “secretly ban” or “turn down the reach” of a political party or candidate. That is apparently worse than Twitter openly banning candidates and suspending accounts of conservatives for years. Melber is warning the left that Twitter could be used against them . . . the way it has been used against their opponents. He emphasized “this thing matters a ton.” That is a ton more than it mattered for the last six years.\n\nMelber warned his viewers that\n\n“If you own all of Twitter or Facebook or what have you, you don’t have to explain yourself, you don’t even have to be transparent, you could secretly ban one party’s candidate or all of its candidates, all of it nominees. Or you could just secretly turn down the reach of their stuff and turn up the reach of something else and the rest of us might not even find about it til after the election.”\n\nThat is precisely what Twitter has been doing without a whimper of objection from most pundits on the left.\n\nMelber actually warns that Musk might secretly ban political figures while warning that Donald Trump will have his ban lifted by Musk. While Trump said that he will not return to Twitter, Melber is worried that he could be allowed to tweet again.\n\nNone of this was a threat to democracy when Twitter was suspending dozens of political figures and commentators, including the President of the United States.\n\nHowever, now it is dire as Musk threatens to restore free speech protections to the platform:\n\n“It’s true if you are a democracy like the United States that used to regulate media ownership and say Rupert Murdoch can’t have too many local TV stations and newspapers in one town, they have laws for that are still on the books. Congress hasn’t gotten round to limiting whether someone can own all of Twitter.”\n\nSo media figures are calling for government regulation of media after the first major victory against corporate censorship. Musk may prove a fraud or he prove a champion of free speech. Yet, it is hard to see the downside given the massive censorship system now imposed across social media. There remain media figures who would prefer censorship to the outbreak of free speech.\n\nIt seems that, when it comes to free speech, there are simply some people you cannot reach.', 'image': 'http://img.youtube.com/vi/lAR2GCCzB7k/0.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:29'}

That’s made her a target of right-wing criticism, particularly when Twitter blocked the distribution of a New York Post article about President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, in 2020. She faced a renewed wave of criticism after multiple reports confirmed she was behind the decision to ban Trump from Twitter. -Politico\n\nIn other words, Gadde is likely the exec who signed off on ZeroHedge\'s February 2020 ban for speculating that Covid-19 may have emerged from a Wuhan Lab, and President Trump\'s January 2021 ban in connection with the capitol riot.\n\nShe has shepherded Twitter through some of its most contentious political battles, including the decisions to remove all political advertising and to boot former President Donald Trump from the platform in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Hill — a position that has earned her devoted fans within Twitter, as well as a large contingent of right-wing critics. But as news of Musk’s official takeover broke, policy and legal employees fretted at the meeting about what his leadership could mean for Twitter’s carefully crafted online speech rules, including its policies against hate speech, misinformation and even political advertising. -Politico\n\nShe played a \'leading role\' in the negotiation between Twitter and Musk, according to the report.\n\n"I think everyone at Twitter, regardless of how they feel about the news, is feeling reflective and emotional," said a Twitter employee. "We’ve gone through a lot in the past two years and I think it’s generally instigated a lot of reflection. I think this was more of an acknowledgment of the uncertainty everyone is feeling right now."\n\nAs a reminder, Gadde is crying because her new boss is a \'free speech absolutist,\' while she wants to silence divergent opinions from her own.\n\nshe seemed so tough then:https://t.co/3HXyJkeGnY — 01 (@seancpdx) April 26, 2022\n\n"I’m often inspired by the vigorous debates on controversial issues that occur on Twitter, but I’ve also been seriously troubled by the plight of some of our users who are completely overwhelmed by those who are trying to silence healthy discourse in the name of free expression," Gadde wrote in 2015. "At times, this takes the form of hateful speech in tweets directed at women or minority groups; at others, it takes the form of threats aimed to intimidate those who take a stand on issues."\n\nWhat a crying shame.', 'image': 'https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2022-04/bobs.png?itok=uLuhnxRt', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:00'}

Twitter independent board chair Bret Taylor described the deal as “the best path forward” for the company’s shareholders.\n\nThe result ends prolonged speculation over Musk’s financial interest in Twitter. On April 4, the entrepreneur’s 9.2 percent stake in the company—or 73.5 million shares at a cost of around $2.4 billion—was disclosed to the public. At the time, the purchase of stock in Twitter came with an offer to sit on the board—though on April 10 Musk declined to take his seat.\n\nHe soon made it obvious that he wanted the whole thing. On April 14, Musk offered to buy the remaining percentage of the company for $54.20 per share—a 38 percent premium on the price he paid for his initial investment. Musk’s accompanying letter to the chair of Twitter’s board was strident in its criticism of the platform. “I believe in [Twitter’s] potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” he wrote. However, he added, “I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.”\n\nInstead, he wanted to take the company private, offering $44 billion for it in a “best and final” offer. At the time, analysts were split about the likelihood of Musk’s bid succeeding, and whether it was good value; while it sat in the middle of the usual 30 to 40 percent premium above the trading price, the stock price had reached well above that just last year. Twitter’s board, for its part, said it would evaluate the offer.\n\n“He’s setting a bit of a precedent for activists that will go after a company,” says Timothy Galpin, senior lecturer in strategy and innovation at the Said Business School at the University of Oxford. “It’s been done a bit before by Carl Icahn and a few others, but it’s not as prevalent to go after the whole company.”\n\nOn the same day that he lodged his bid to take over the entirety of Twitter and take it private, Musk appeared at a TED talk in Vancouver, where he laid out his vision. “This is not a way to sort of make money,” he claimed. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important.” That gave some within Twitter, and those who held large shares in the platform, pause.\n\nContemporary reports indicated Twitter would fight to repel Musk, while the Tesla and Space X CEO got into a Twitter spat about press freedom with Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Company, a major shareholder that said it would reject Musk’s offer.

Will banned users return?\n\nMusk has laid out a more relaxed vision for content moderation that would lean toward temporary “timeouts” over permanent bans.\n\nAdvocacy groups are concerned that this switch could reverse Twitter’s permanent bans on public figures and politicians — including former President Trump.\n\n2. Leadership changes: While Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n3. How could the product change?: Major changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n4. Washington’s ire: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech.”\n\n5. How will Twitter’s workers respond?: Twitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCOVID ABSENCES FURTHER DELAY FTC VOTE\n\nThe vote on Alvaro Bedoya’s nomination to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to be further delayed due to COVID-19 linked absences in the Senate, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide.\n\nSens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Vice President Harris all tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans have broadly pushed back on Bedoya’s nomination to the FTC, leaving Democrats in need of all senators and Harris present to secure his confirmation.\n\nThe Senate aide said absent to an objection by Republicans, the Senate is expected to delay the consideration of Bedoya to a later date.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee advanced Bedoya in a vote along party lines in March, after delays based on Sen. Ben Ray Luján’s (D-N.M.) absence while he recovered from a stroke.\n\nAs he awaits confirmation, the FTC remains split along party lines, thwarting Democrats from pushing forward with their full agenda.\n\nEU WARNS MUSK\n\nThierry Breton, the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market, tweeted Tuesday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who just secured a deal to buy Twitter, will have to comply with the commission’s rules on moderation.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules — regardless of their shareholding,” Breton tweeted. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\n“He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nBITS AND PIECES\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Elon Musk’s Twitter purchase brings free speech into sharp focus\n\nLighter click: happy carrot time\n\nNotable links from around the web:\n\nWhat Elon Musk’s battles with Washington might mean for Twitter (Politico / Emily Birnbaum)\n\nHow to Become a MAGA Rap Kingpin (Without Believing What You’re Saying) (Rolling Stone / Alice Hines)\n\nFacebook Doesn’t Know What It Does With Your Data, Or Where It Goes: Leaked Document (Motherboard / Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai)\n\nOne last thing: Truth Social struggles\n\nShares that are tied with the company funding former President Trump’s latest social media venture, Truth Social, took a dive on Monday after social media platform Twitter announced its deal with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nCNBC reported that Digital World Acquisition Corp.’s shares fell to nearly 13 percent on Monday, bringing the company’s year-to-date losses to more than 30 percent.\n\nTruth Social, which officially launched in February, was created by Trump after he was permanently banned from multiple social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram for actions involving the Jan.6 insurrection at the Capitol, CNBC noted.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech, or falsehoods that subvert our democracy,” the civil rights group’s memo added, referencing Trump and saying that “lives are at risk, and so is American democracy.”\n\nTrump was permanently banned from Twitter in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCyberattacks hit European energy firms\n\nGerman-based renewable energy companies have been hit with cyberattacks since Russia began its war in Ukraine, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nThe attacks on the three wind-energy firms – Deutsche Windtechnik AG, Nordex SE, Enercon GmbH – disrupted some of their operations and forced one company to shut down its information technology systems.\n\nDeutsche Windtechnik AG, which was hacked in April, said that systems controlling about 2,000 wind turbines in Germany were down for a day following the attack.\n\nNordex SE, a turbine maker, was forced to switch off its information technology systems after detecting a breach in late March. Ransomware group Conti claims to be behind the attack.\n\nThe attack on the three companies comes as many western European countries plan to reduce their reliance on Russian fuel as they transition to more eco-friendly energy sources.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAMAZON UNION GOES FOR TWO\n\nWorkers at an Amazon sorting facility in Staten Island, N.Y., will begin voting on unionization Monday, less than a month after a warehouse in the borough became the first of the e-commerce giant’s U.S. locations to unionize.\n\nAfter the unprecedented victory in the company’s first Staten Island union election, at the warehouse known as JFK8, the Amazon Labor Union (ALU) is hoping for a similar result at the LDJ5 facility.\n\nA win at LDJ5 could further prove the viability of the worker-led union and secure key protections for the facility’s workers.\n\nThe e-commerce giant, meanwhile, may stand to lose more than just a vote: Consecutive wins for campaigns it has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into defeating could diminish its perception as an all-powerful employer and spark more organizing.\n\nRead more here.\n\nBITS & PIECES\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Are journalism and Twitter headed for splitsville?\n\nLighter click: Don’t forget about the real victims\n\nNotable links from around the web:\n\nDoctors Are Dropping Out Of This Medical NFT Project, Which Promised DMs With TikTok-Famous Physicians (BuzzFeed News / Emily Baker-White and Sarah Emerson)\n\nWhen Police Do Marketing for Surveillance Tech Companies (Motherboard / Matthew Gault and Jason Koebler)\n\nTwitter Employees Search for Answers as Musk Deal Takes Shape (The New York Times / Kate Conger)\n\nOne more thing: Europe adopts tech rule\n\nGoogle, Meta and other large tech firms will need to more strictly police their platforms under landmark legislation green-lit by EU officials over the weekend.\n\nThe Digital Services Act targets hate speech, disinformation on online platforms and other harmful content, with officials reaching an agreement on the measure Saturday.\n\nThe DSA also gives regulators more power to impose billions in fines on companies that breach the new legislation.\n\nRead more from the AP here.\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

In a recent TED interview, the billionaire said he’d like to see Twitter err on the side of allowing speech instead of moderating it. He said he’d be “very reluctant” to delete tweets and would generally be cautious about permanent bans. He also acknowledged that Twitter would have to abide by national laws governing speech in markets around the world.\n\nMusk himself, though, regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and has used the platform to bully reporters who have written critical articles about him or his company.\n\nTwitter’s board at first enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But when Musk outlined the financial commitments he’d lined up to back his offer of $46.5 billion — and no other bidders emerged — the board opened negotiations with him.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nElon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter is gaining steam and could be announced as early as Monday, according to media reports about the social media company\'s late-stage negotiations with the Tesla CEO, who has offered more than $40 billion to privatize the platform and pledged to be more lenient when it comes to policing users\' speech.\n\nTwitter and Musk spoke Sunday and into the early hours Monday, The New York Times reported, less than two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform that he uses to promote his interests, attack critics and opine on social and economic issues to his more than 83 million followers.\n\nMusk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal. Musk hasn\'t commented on the negotiations but on Monday waded into the buzz about them on Twitter, where some users are promising to quit the platform if he takes over.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he tweeted.\n\nMusk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has voiced a number of proposed changes for the company, from relaxing its content restrictions — such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump’s account — to ridding the platform of fake and automated accounts, and shifting away from its advertising-based revenue model.\n\nTwitter’s board has flexibility in judging Musk’s proposal not just on the finances but also the specifics of his business plan and how it could affect users, advertisers and employees — some of whom might leave, said Kevin Kaiser, a finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“What’s critical for the board is whether they think it’s in the best interest of the company,” Kaiser said. “That can come from many, many factors.”\n\nKaiser said the board could decide that Musk’s plan has “too many negative impacts,” but that would be a hard case to make given how much Musk is offering to pay.\n\nAsked during a recent TED talk if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter or any forum is “obviously bound by the laws of the country that it operates in. So obviously there are some limitations on free speech in the US, and, of course, Twitter would have to abide by those rules.”\n\nBeyond that, though, he said he’d be “very reluctant” to delete things and in general be cautious about permanent bans.\n\nIt won’t be perfect, Musk added, “but I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible."\n\nTwitter had initially enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But the board decided to negotiate after Musk updated his proposal last week to show he had secured financing, according to The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the negotiations were underway.\n\nA rival bidder to Musk may not be stepping up any time soon, fearful of the byzantine task of moderating content on the platform, something that Musk has vowed to do less of.\n\n“The Twitter Board could not find a white knight and with Musk’s financing detailed the clock has essentially struck midnight for the board which is why negotiations have begun to get a deal done,” said Dan Ives, who follows Twitter for Wedbush Securities.\n\nThe Times, citing people with knowledge of the situation who it did not identify, said the two sides were discussing details including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart. The people said the situation was fluid and fast-moving.\n\nWhile Twitter’s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as Facebook and TikTok, the service is popular with celebrities, world leaders, journalists and intellectuals. Musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. rose 5% Monday to $51.50 per share. On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy the social media platform for $54.20 per share, or about $43 billion, but did not say at the time how he would finance the acquisition.\n\nLast week, he said in documents filed with U.S. securities regulators that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in Tesla.\n\nTwitter has not commented.\n\nMusk is the world’s wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a nearly $279 billion fortune. But much of his money is tied up in Tesla stock — he owns about 17% of the electric car company, according to FactSet, which is valued at more than $1 trillion — and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It’s unclear how much cash Musk has.\n\nMusk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, to Compaq for $307 million. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly. It was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nThat same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting NASA’s interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets.\n\nIn 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to astronomical success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles.\n\n——\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

Musk said other investors could contribute to the financing.\n\nThe locked-in financing not only underscored the seriousness of Musk\'s pursuit, but also appeared to open the door to other large Twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the San Francisco company.\n\nThe details of those conversations aren’t known, but Musk could point to a more than 20-year history building and running several businesses — most notably as the longtime CEO of Tesla. The electric car maker is currently valued at $1 trillion -- roughly 25 times more than Twitter.\n\n“I think there is nothing better for Twitter than Elon Musk buying it and ideally replacing the board, and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue-generating sources," said John Meyer, a technology entrepreneur and investor. “Musk has the track record that he can do the impossible."\n\nIt would be easy to see why other Twitter shareholders might welcome a shake-up, as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment. Before Musk disclosed his 9% stake in Twitter earlier this month, the shares were trading below $40 — not that much more it its $26 price when Twitter went public in November 2013. Since then, the tech-driven Nasdaq has more than tripled, even after a recent downturn. Twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising, Google and Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla’s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010. And after struggling to make money for more than a decade, the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of $3.3 billion during the first three months of this year alone.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nAs is customary once a company agrees to be acquired, the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren’t any red flags that haven’t come up via the company’s public filings.\n\nThis step in the process isn’t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal, said Angelo Zino, tech analyst at CFRA.\n\n“He’s acquiring this company, not from a financial perspective,” Zino said. “He’s going to do what he wants with it and he’s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company.”\n\nWHAT SAY COULD REGULATORS HAVE?\n\nLast year, Twitter generated $5 billion in revenue, with $2.8 billion from the U.S. and the rest earned overseas, Zino said. The Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., or the European Commission in the EU, are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed Twitter buyout.\n\nThe main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry, or whether it violates antitrust laws.\n\nThese reviews can take months, or longer, but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining, or in the case of a single buyer, whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry.\n\nNeither Tesla, nor Musk’s other company, Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, are social media platforms, so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal, analysts said.\n\n“We do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with Musk owning Twitter,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Monday.\n\nWHEN DO SHAREHOLDERS GET TO VOTE?\n\nThe deal is expected to close in 2022, subject to the approval of Twitter shareholders. Twitter hasn’t announced the timing of a shareholder vote, though the company’s annual meeting is set for May 25, which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders.\n\nA company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time, even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TWITTER LEADERSHIP?\n\nAt this early stage, it’s unclear what will happen to Twitter\'s current board or management team if the deal is completed, but Musk has made it abundantly clear that he believes the company has been poorly run. That assessment is a strong indication that Musk’s makeover will also include a purge of Twitter’s top ranks.', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:56'}

Subsequent events put that moniker to the test, as repressive regimes cracked down on Twitter users, particularly in the wake of the short-lived “Arab Spring” demonstrations. In the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums.\n\nOver the subsequent years, Twitter learned a few things about the consequences of running a largely unmoderated social platform — one of the most important being that companies generally don't want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement, and misinformation that aims to tip elections or undermine public health.\n\n“With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself,” said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. “If you stop moderating with automated systems and human reviews, a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool.”\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the “health” of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the “report abuse” button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy’s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invested in staff and technology that detect violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violates its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used their platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies also stepped up their efforts against political misinformation.\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk, who describes himself as a “free-speech absolutist,” wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nEven now, Americans say they’re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a “fair or poor” job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.\n\nMeanwhile, terms like “censorship” and “free speech” have turned into political rallying cries for conservatives, frustrated by seeing right-leaning commentators and high-profile Republican officials booted off Facebook and Twitter for violating their rules.\n\nMusk appeared to criticize Twitter’s permanent ban of President Donald Trump last year for messages that the tech company said helped incite the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last year.\n\n“A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech,” Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nTrump’s allies, including his son Donald Trump Jr., have even pleaded for Musk to buy out the company.\n\n“If Elon Musk can privately send people into space I’m sure he can design a social network that isn’t biased,” Trump Jr. said in the caption of a video posted to Instagram last April.\n\nKirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame, said Twitter has consistently worked at being a “responsible” social media company through its moderation system, its hires in the area of machine learning ethics and in whom they allow to do research on the platform. The fact that Musk wants to change that, she added, suggests that he's focused on “irresponsible social media.”\n\nTwitter declined to comment for this story. A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to a message for comment.\n\nNew social media apps targeted at conservatives, including Trump’s Truth Social, haven't come remotely close to matching the success of Facebook or Twitter. That's partly because Republican politicians, politicians and causes already draw large audiences on existing, and much better established, platforms.\n\nIt's also partly due to floods of inflammatory, false or violent posts. Last year, for example, right-wing social media site Parler was nearly wiped off the internet when it became evident that rioters had used the app to promote violent messages and organize the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol. Apple and Google barred its app from their online stores, while Amazon stopped providing web-hosting services for the site.\n\nMusk himself regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and sometimes bullies reporters who have written critical articles about him or Tesla. He regularly tweets at reporters who write about his company, sometimes mischaracterizing their work as “false” or “misleading.”\n\nHis popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of the reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\n“I only block people as a direct insult,” Musk tweeted in 2020, responding to a tweet from a reporter.\n\nEvan Greer, a political activist with Fight for the Future, said Musk’s lack of experience in moderating an influential social media platform will be a problem if he successfully takes over the company.\n\n“If we want to protect free speech online, then we can’t live in a world where the richest person on Earth can just purchase a platform that millions of people depend on and then change the rules to his liking,” Greer said.", 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:34'}

The race to the bottom begins,” Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning Media Matters for America, said in a statement.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), using her official account, suggested that after Musk “seals the deal” she will get access to her personal account “restored” after it was banned in January for repeated violations of Twitter’s COVID-19 misinformation policy.\n\nTrump said Monday he would not return to Twitter but would remain on his own platform, Truth Social. However, some of Trump’s advisers told The Washington Post they don’t think he would turn down an offer to return to the platform that brought him so much attention during his campaign and term.\n\nMedia Matters compiled a list of banned Twitter users, including Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander and prominent QAnon figures celebrating Musk’s takeover, that critics believe could pose a threat if allowed back on the platform.\n\n“These folks are organized,” said Jessica González, co-CEO of Free Press and co-founder of Change the Terms.\n\n“I’m really talking about sophisticated, coordinated … efforts to use these platforms to radicalize people, to raise funds, to normalize violence and to issue calls to action for violent and threatening activity that happens in real life,” she added.\n\nLeadership changes\n\nWhile Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n“I think we feel very comfortable that [the deal] gives this team the ability to continue to make the company successful in between signing and closing the transaction,” Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter’s board of directors, reportedly said during a company-wide town hall Monday evening.\n\nOnce the deal is closed however, a shakeup at the top of the company seems likely.\n\nMusk’s relationship with current leadership has not been publicly confrontational. But Musk did reject their offer to join the board, an indication that he might be interested in pursuing his own vision of the platform.\n\nAgrawal will be in line for a $38.7 million pay package if the deal goes through and Musk chooses to terminate him.\n\nIt would be difficult for Musk to head the company alone given his active leadership or involvement in Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink.\n\nWhom Musk chooses to head Twitter if he refreshes current leadership could be the clearest signal of his plans for the platform.\n\n“Once the deal closes, we don’t know which direction the platform will go,” Agrawal reportedly admitted during Monday’s town hall.\n\nHow could the product change?\n\nMajor changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n“I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,” he said in a statement on the deal’s announcement.\n\nMusk has said that algorithms that make recommendations to users on what accounts to follow, posts to view or topics to read up on should be opened to public viewing.\n\nSuch a move could assuage concerns about political bias on the platform and give researchers much-needed access to social media’s levers.\n\nBut Twitter has already been very open about the effect of its algorithms. The company released a study in the fall finding that they tend to amplify right-leaning politicians more than their counterparts.\n\nFully publishing complex algorithms could not only lead to confusion, but open the platform up to cybersecurity risks.\n\nMusk has been very vocal about his desire to cut down on spam on Twitter but has given few specifics about how he would do.\n\nMusk’s proposal to authenticate all humans on Twitter has also prompted worry from civil society groups.\n\nSimple checks like CAPTCHAs before posting would likely be gameable with spam bots, while more stringent checks like ID verification would destroy the pseudonymity that Twitter has worked hard to maintain.\n\nEven if users are not required to post their real names on the platform, that data will have to be collected by Twitter and, therefore, could be compelled by governments to turn it over.\n\nThe impacts on free speech and the right to protest, especially in authoritarian states that already have rules against government criticism on social media, could be devastating.\n\n“There are no easy ways to require verification without wreaking havoc for some users, and for free speech,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in statement.\n\nWashington’s ire\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech overlords.”\n\n“Elon Musk is helping us defeat the Big Tech overlords. Our digital public squares need to be returned to us,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) tweeted.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) echoed Musk’s own words, saying the platform’s “full potential” will be unlocked if Musk can change the platform to “actually protect free speech and encourage open discourse.”\n\nThe GOP support builds on years of attacks on Twitter over claims of the platform censoring content with an anti-conservative bias.\n\nBut Democrats say Musk’s ownership raises additional concerns about the spread of disinformation.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told The Hill.\n\nSome progressives are using Musk’s takeover to push for a wealth tax and elevate concerns about power consolidation.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted.\n\nHow will Twitter’s workers respond?\n\nTwitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\n“Can someone just tell me if I’m rich or fired please,” one said.\n\n“The news today is so crazy I literally forgot I have COVID,” posted another.\n\nThe majority of the company’s 5,000-plus employees work in liberal San Francisco and, until now, have worked for a platform known for its aggressive approach to content moderation.\n\nThe company has led social media competitors in reacting to Trump’s dissemination of election disinformation and the spread of misinformation about COVID-19.\n\nMusk’s version of free speech appears to run counter to that approach, setting up potential ideological clashes.\n\nThe company reportedly took a precautionary measure Monday by temporarily freezing changes to the platform until next week. The move comes after one employee briefly took down Trump’s account several years ago.\n\nMusk also has a less than stellar reputation for the treatment of his employees.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing is in the midst of a lawsuit against Tesla over allegations of racism and harassment toward Black employees at a plant in Fremont, Calif.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board also found Tesla allegedly unlawfully interrogated and threatened workers over suspected union campaigns.\n\nThe loss of one of the key financial benefits of working for Twitter — stock — is unlikely to help matters.\n\n“Elon aside, can anyone explain to me how Twitter will hire/keep employees since there isn’t company stock to create competitive comp packages? A significant part of our pay is in RSUs,” on employee asked Tuesday.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/MuskElon_42622_AP.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:19'}

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:11'}

Only a quarter of respondents said they thought that Musk would make Twitter a better place, just ten per cent thought Twitter content moderation practices are too strict, and just over a third said Twitter\'s algorithms should be open sourced. The majority did say they wanted spam bots eliminated, and to be able to edit tweets after posting – two changes Musk has pledged to enact.\n\nThe mood inside Twitter is one of uncertainty: employees say they\'ve been left in the dark, and are worried that a stock buyout will lead to long-term financial losses for some Twitter employees, many of whom make 50 per cent of their income on stock options.\n\nAnalyst opinions are also uncertain what sort of financial impact the sale will have on Twitter itself, which stands to lose a good chunk of its revenue to Musk\'s loans: it\'ll likely cost the company around $1 billion per year in debt servicing costs – see the Twitter thread below – and it recorded $5.08 billion revenue in 2021. ®\n\nTwitter will have about $1 billion in interest payments due annually after this buyout – and its cash flows are projected to be about $1.43 billion this year and $1.85 billion in 2023.

Wall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers.\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9% stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. rose more than 5% Monday to $51.70 per share. On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share. While the stock is up sharply since Musk made his offer, it is well below the high of $77 per share it reached in February 2021.\n\nMusk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has proposed relaxing Twitter content restrictions — such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump’s account — while ridding the platform of fake “spambot” accounts and shifting away advertising as its primary revenue model. Musk believes he can increase revenue through subscriptions that give paying customers a better experience — possibly even an ad-free version of Twitter.\n\nAsked during a recent TED interview if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he’d be “very reluctant” to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company’s rules.\n\nIt won’t be perfect, Musk added, “but I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible.”\n\nAfter the deal was announced, the NAACP released a statement urging Musk not to allow Trump, the 45th president, back onto the platform.\n\n“Do not allow 45 to return to the platform,” the civil rights organization said in a statement. “Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy.”\n\nAs both candidate and president, Trump made Twitter a powerful megaphone for speaking directly to the public, often using incendiary and divisive language on hot-button issues. He was permanently banned from the service in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisers, currently Twitter’s main customers, have also pushed for the stronger content rules Musk has criticized. Keeping them happy requires moderation limiting hate speech so that brands aren’t trying to promote their products next to “calls for genocide,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.\n\n“If Musk either fires or drives away the team at Twitter that’s committed to keeping it clean and making it less hate-filled, he’ll see an immediate drop in user activity,” said Vaidhyanathan. “I think he’s going to find pretty fast that inviting the bigots back in is bad for business.”\n\nSome users said Monday that they were planning to quit the platform if Musk took it over. To which he responded on Twitter: “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nMusk has also run into trouble with federal officials as a result of his own tweets, some of which he’s used to taunt regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting. More recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition.\n\nWhile Twitter’s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as Facebook and TikTok, the service is popular with celebrities, world leaders, journalists and intellectuals. Musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts.\n\nLast week, he said in SEC documents that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in Tesla, the electric-vehicle company he runs.\n\nMusk has a fortune of nearly $268 billion, much of which is tied up in Tesla stock and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It’s unclear how much cash Musk holds.\n\nMusk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, to Compaq for $307 million. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly. It was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nThat same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting NASA’s interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets.\n\nIn 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to astronomical success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles.\n\nMusk’s pledge to make Twitter a haven for free speech could dim the appeal of Donald Trump’s troubled Truth Social app, which the former president has touted as a competitor to Twitter that would cater to conservatives. Truth Social is part of Trump’s new media company, which has agreed to be taken public by Digital World Acquisition Corp. Shares of DWAC dropped 16.2% Monday and are down 46% since Musk revealed his stake in Twitter.\n\n__\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit. O’Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

For others who worry that Musk will give free rein to agitators who spew hate, lies and other harmful content, making the platform too toxic for advertisers and average users, Musk has offered few assurances.\n\n“The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all,” he tweeted Tuesday\n\nMany of Musk’s proposed changes reflect his own experience as a high-profile and outspoken Twitter user with more than 85 million followers and a swarm of pesky impersonator accounts that use his name and photo to promote cryptocurrency schemes. The statement announcing his acquisition of Twitter on Monday highlighted the need to defeat “spam bots” that mimic real users.\n\nBut what about Twitter’s more than 200 million other users who aren’t getting banned or flooded with spam? There’s still a lot of uncertainty about whether his ideas are technologically feasible and whether these changes would benefit most regular users, or serve some other purpose.\n\n“He’s made it pretty clear he’s not interested in making Twitter a profitable enterprise," said Joan Donovan, who studies misinformation at Harvard University. “It’s about the power and the influence of Twitter itself and its importance in our culture."\n\nExperts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter for years have expressed doubt that Musk knows exactly what he is getting into. And some of the problems he has identified aren\'t felt by most users.\n\n“The spam bots, for him, are highly visible and somewhat personal,” said Donovan. “Most people don’t see a lot of these spammy accounts.”\n\nAnd for those unhappy with the company\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation, there are plenty of fledgling examples of “free speech”-focused social media platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter antidotes, largely by conservatives. Many have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n“This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power,” said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. “I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter’s values.”\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk’s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n“This platform is pretty much the same one we’ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You’ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they’ve had trouble. It’s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway.”\n\nBut others familiar with Twitter say they\'re dismayed at Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n“Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform,” said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n“I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting,” Miley said. “He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter.”\n\nThe more hands-off approach to content moderation that Musk envisions has many users concerned that the platform will reanimate accounts that propagated dangerous conspiracies and harassment.\n\nWall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers — Twitter\'s chief revenue source. And it could make it harder to retain the San Francisco-based company\'s more than 7,500 employees, some of whom are already voicing concerns about the possibility of a backslide on content standards.\n\nIn Europe, officials reminded Musk about a new law, the Digital Services Act, that will force tech companies to step up policing of their online platforms.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules – regardless of their shareholding,” tweeted Thierry Breton, the European Union commissioner in charge of the bloc’s internal market. “Mr. Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMusk’s takeover is not yet a done deal and still awaits the approval of a majority of Twitter\'s stockholders. Twitter previously scheduled its annual shareholders meeting for May 25, but a regulatory filing Tuesday said the company will be convening a special meeting “as promptly as reasonably practicable."\n\nWhile there are likely to be some bumps along the way, there don\'t appear to be serious enough obstacles to stop the deal, according to Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\n\nTwitter or Musk can walk away from the deal if it’s not completed by Oct. 24, but if either Musk or Twitter is deemed responsible for the deal not going forward, they would have to pay a $1 billion termination fee, according to details of the transaction contained in a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The filing also showed that Twitter will drop a “poison pill” measure it had earlier adopted to defend against Musk\'s takeover by making it prohibitively expensive.\n\nNormally when companies go private, dissenting shareholders are forcibly cashed out. Some could challenge the stock price in court, contending that Musk should pay more, but that probably won’t hold up the sale, Elson said.\n\nIt’s likely that Musk would dissolve the current board and replace it with a new one that would agree with his management direction. And once Twitter is private, Musk will face fewer gripes from shareholders that often bring lawsuits, Elson said. Private companies also don’t face as much scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been a finger in Musk’s eye for years, often because of statements he\'s made on Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, shares of Twitter traded just under $50, below the $54.20 purchase price. Twitter will offer a glimpse into the health of its business when it reports its quarterly financial results Thursday.\n\nTwitter\'s constituents aren\'t the only ones anxious about Musk\'s $44 billion investment.\n\nShares of Musk\'s electric car company, Tesla, have lost about 19% of their value since Musk announced his stake in Twitter, including about a 12% decline on Tuesday. Analysts say investors are fearful that Musk will be distracted by the social media company and less engaged in running Tesla.\n\n“He’s going to be spending more time with another venture,” Edward Jones Senior Equity Analyst Jeff Windau said of Musk, who also runs SpaceX, The Boring Co., which digs tunnels, and Neuralink, a computer-brain interface company. “There’s a potential limit on the amount of bandwidth that you can apply to each of these companies."\n\n——\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

They may also reveal clues as to how Musk will govern the platform he hopes to own.\n\n“Look at the feed: It\'s all over the place. It\'s erratic. At times it\'s pretty extreme,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media and who recently assigned Musk\'s tweets as reading material for their students. “It paints him as some sort of rebel leader who will take control of the public square to save it. That is a myth he has constructed.”\n\nMusk joined Twitter in 2010 and now has more than 85 million followers — the seventh most of any account and the highest for any business leader. He had mused about buying the site before he agreed on Monday to pay $44 billion for Twitter, which he said he hopes to turn into a haven where all speech is allowed.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk wrote in a tweet.\n\nAs the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk uses his Twitter account to make business announcements and promote his enterprises. He muses about technology and trade, but has also posted jokes about women\'s breasts and once compared Canada\'s prime minister to Hitler. He regularly weighs in on global events, as he did in March 2020 when he tweeted that “The coronavirus pandemic is dumb."\n\nHe\'s also used the account to punch back at critics, such as when he called a diver working to rescue boys trapped in a cave in Thailand a “pedo," short for pedophile. The diver had previously criticized Musk\'s proposal to use a sub to rescue the boys. Musk, who won a defamation suit filed by the diver, later said he never intended “pedo” to be interpreted as “pedophile.”\n\nA few years ago, after software engineer Cher Scarlett criticized Musk\'s handling of the cave incident, the tech billionaire fired back and she was soon being harassed by dozens of Musk\'s online fans. He later deleted the posts, but not before Scarlett had to lock down her account because she was receiving so many hateful messages.\n\n“It\'s ironic to me that somebody who claims they want to buy Twitter to protect free speech has such thin skin,” she said. “He\'s a very smart man, and when he replies to people that criticize him, he knows what he\'s doing. To me that\'s not championing free speech, it\'s weaponizing free speech, and I think that\'s what he\'ll do owning this platform.”\n\nNineteen-year-old Jack Sweeney got Musk\'s attention when he created an automated Twitter account that tracked the movements of Musk\'s jet. Musk responded by offering Sweeney $5,000 to pull the account. When Sweeney refused, Musk blocked him on Twitter.\n\nSweeney said he\'s worried he may get kicked off the site entirely if Musk\'s takeover is approved. But he said he likes Musk\'s free speech absolutism, and hopes he sees it through.\n\n“He’ll make it more open, and I think that\'s a good thing,” Sweeney said.\n\nMusk\'s use of Twitter has also led to problems for his own companies. In one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting.\n\nMore recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition.\n\nLast year another federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, ordered Musk to delete a tweet that officials said illegally threatened to cut stock options for Tesla employees who joined the United Auto Workers union.\n\nThose tweets helped cement Musk\'s reputation as a brash outsider, a workingman\'s billionaire, Grygiel said. But that doesn\'t mean he is equipped to run a social media platform with more than 200 million users, the professor added.\n\n“Maybe he wants to burn it down,” Grygiel said. “I don\'t know. But I do know that it shows that no one person should have this kind of power.”', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:46'}

Melber warns that Elon Musk might actually use Twitter to “secretly ban” or “turn down the reach” of a political party or candidate. That is apparently worse than Twitter openly banning candidates and suspending accounts of conservatives for years. Melber is warning the left that Twitter could be used against them . . . the way it has been used against their opponents. He emphasized “this thing matters a ton.” That is a ton more than it mattered for the last six years.\n\nMelber warned his viewers that\n\n“If you own all of Twitter or Facebook or what have you, you don’t have to explain yourself, you don’t even have to be transparent, you could secretly ban one party’s candidate or all of its candidates, all of it nominees. Or you could just secretly turn down the reach of their stuff and turn up the reach of something else and the rest of us might not even find about it til after the election.”\n\nThat is precisely what Twitter has been doing without a whimper of objection from most pundits on the left.\n\nMelber actually warns that Musk might secretly ban political figures while warning that Donald Trump will have his ban lifted by Musk. While Trump said that he will not return to Twitter, Melber is worried that he could be allowed to tweet again.\n\nNone of this was a threat to democracy when Twitter was suspending dozens of political figures and commentators, including the President of the United States.\n\nHowever, now it is dire as Musk threatens to restore free speech protections to the platform:\n\n“It’s true if you are a democracy like the United States that used to regulate media ownership and say Rupert Murdoch can’t have too many local TV stations and newspapers in one town, they have laws for that are still on the books. Congress hasn’t gotten round to limiting whether someone can own all of Twitter.”\n\nSo media figures are calling for government regulation of media after the first major victory against corporate censorship. Musk may prove a fraud or he prove a champion of free speech. Yet, it is hard to see the downside given the massive censorship system now imposed across social media. There remain media figures who would prefer censorship to the outbreak of free speech.\n\nIt seems that, when it comes to free speech, there are simply some people you cannot reach.', 'image': 'http://img.youtube.com/vi/lAR2GCCzB7k/0.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:29'}

Musk\'s statement announcing the go-private deal hinted at several possible changes, including "authenticating all humans," defeating spam and "enhancing the product with new features," but details remain to be clarified.\n\nThe statement quoted Musk as saying that he values free speech and hopes to "make Twitter better than ever" and maintain the platform\'s status as "the digital town square."

Musk has pursued legal action against people who have criticized him publicly in the past.\n\nYork also noted that Musk\'s ownership, coupled with the fact that direct messages on the platform remain unencrypted, could create – in theory – a problem for business users.\n\n"For years, people have been calling on Twitter to encrypt direct messages," she said. "Theoretically, this means that [Musk] could access your DMs. And for businesses that could pose a threat."\n\nYet there\'s also plenty of reason to believe that Twitter might not change much, particularly in the short-term, as a result of Musk\'s buyout of the company. Unless Musk fires huge numbers of employees and replaces them, the people who make key decisions on content policy and moderation will still be there.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to see how this will be better or worse for users than a bunch of shareholders having control over the company," York said.\n\nMoreover, it\'s difficult to see how Musk could accomplish some of the expressed goals he outlined in today\'s statement, she added.\n\n"Going after bots and misinformation is a hard thing to do," she said. "So I think … he\'s going to hit a really hard problem when he tries to deal with it."\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed transaction, expected to occur by the end of the year and subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter\'s closing stock price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk publicly disclosed an approximately 9% stake in Twitter, the company said. After that disclosure, Musk publicly offered to buy Twitter, and initially the company appeared ready to rebuff the offer — it adopted a so-called "poison pill" stricture, which holds that if any person or group acquires ownership of at least 15% of Twitter’s outstanding common stock without the board’s approval, other shareholders would be allowed to purchase additional shares at a discount.\n\nUlitmately though, the board agreed to the offer.\n\n"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\'s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing.

Twitter independent board chair Bret Taylor described the deal as “the best path forward” for the company’s shareholders.\n\nThe result ends prolonged speculation over Musk’s financial interest in Twitter. On April 4, the entrepreneur’s 9.2 percent stake in the company—or 73.5 million shares at a cost of around $2.4 billion—was disclosed to the public. At the time, the purchase of stock in Twitter came with an offer to sit on the board—though on April 10 Musk declined to take his seat.\n\nHe soon made it obvious that he wanted the whole thing. On April 14, Musk offered to buy the remaining percentage of the company for $54.20 per share—a 38 percent premium on the price he paid for his initial investment. Musk’s accompanying letter to the chair of Twitter’s board was strident in its criticism of the platform. “I believe in [Twitter’s] potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” he wrote. However, he added, “I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.”\n\nInstead, he wanted to take the company private, offering $44 billion for it in a “best and final” offer. At the time, analysts were split about the likelihood of Musk’s bid succeeding, and whether it was good value; while it sat in the middle of the usual 30 to 40 percent premium above the trading price, the stock price had reached well above that just last year. Twitter’s board, for its part, said it would evaluate the offer.\n\n“He’s setting a bit of a precedent for activists that will go after a company,” says Timothy Galpin, senior lecturer in strategy and innovation at the Said Business School at the University of Oxford. “It’s been done a bit before by Carl Icahn and a few others, but it’s not as prevalent to go after the whole company.”\n\nOn the same day that he lodged his bid to take over the entirety of Twitter and take it private, Musk appeared at a TED talk in Vancouver, where he laid out his vision. “This is not a way to sort of make money,” he claimed. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important.” That gave some within Twitter, and those who held large shares in the platform, pause.\n\nContemporary reports indicated Twitter would fight to repel Musk, while the Tesla and Space X CEO got into a Twitter spat about press freedom with Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Company, a major shareholder that said it would reject Musk’s offer.

Will banned users return?\n\nMusk has laid out a more relaxed vision for content moderation that would lean toward temporary “timeouts” over permanent bans.\n\nAdvocacy groups are concerned that this switch could reverse Twitter’s permanent bans on public figures and politicians — including former President Trump.\n\n2. Leadership changes: While Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n3. How could the product change?: Major changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n4. Washington’s ire: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech.”\n\n5. How will Twitter’s workers respond?: Twitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCOVID ABSENCES FURTHER DELAY FTC VOTE\n\nThe vote on Alvaro Bedoya’s nomination to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to be further delayed due to COVID-19 linked absences in the Senate, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide.\n\nSens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Vice President Harris all tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans have broadly pushed back on Bedoya’s nomination to the FTC, leaving Democrats in need of all senators and Harris present to secure his confirmation.\n\nThe Senate aide said absent to an objection by Republicans, the Senate is expected to delay the consideration of Bedoya to a later date.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee advanced Bedoya in a vote along party lines in March, after delays based on Sen. Ben Ray Luján’s (D-N.M.) absence while he recovered from a stroke.\n\nAs he awaits confirmation, the FTC remains split along party lines, thwarting Democrats from pushing forward with their full agenda.\n\nEU WARNS MUSK\n\nThierry Breton, the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market, tweeted Tuesday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who just secured a deal to buy Twitter, will have to comply with the commission’s rules on moderation.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules — regardless of their shareholding,” Breton tweeted. “Mr Musk knows this well.”\n\n“He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nBITS AND PIECES\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Elon Musk’s Twitter purchase brings free speech into sharp focus\n\nLighter click: happy carrot time\n\nNotable links from around the web:\n\nWhat Elon Musk’s battles with Washington might mean for Twitter (Politico / Emily Birnbaum)\n\nHow to Become a MAGA Rap Kingpin (Without Believing What You’re Saying) (Rolling Stone / Alice Hines)\n\nFacebook Doesn’t Know What It Does With Your Data, Or Where It Goes: Leaked Document (Motherboard / Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai)\n\nOne last thing: Truth Social struggles\n\nShares that are tied with the company funding former President Trump’s latest social media venture, Truth Social, took a dive on Monday after social media platform Twitter announced its deal with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nCNBC reported that Digital World Acquisition Corp.’s shares fell to nearly 13 percent on Monday, bringing the company’s year-to-date losses to more than 30 percent.\n\nTruth Social, which officially launched in February, was created by Trump after he was permanently banned from multiple social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram for actions involving the Jan.6 insurrection at the Capitol, CNBC noted.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

In a recent TED interview, the billionaire said he’d like to see Twitter err on the side of allowing speech instead of moderating it. He said he’d be “very reluctant” to delete tweets and would generally be cautious about permanent bans. He also acknowledged that Twitter would have to abide by national laws governing speech in markets around the world.\n\nMusk himself, though, regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and has used the platform to bully reporters who have written critical articles about him or his company.\n\nTwitter’s board at first enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But when Musk outlined the financial commitments he’d lined up to back his offer of $46.5 billion — and no other bidders emerged — the board opened negotiations with him.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nElon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter is gaining steam and could be announced as early as Monday, according to media reports about the social media company\'s late-stage negotiations with the Tesla CEO, who has offered more than $40 billion to privatize the platform and pledged to be more lenient when it comes to policing users\' speech.\n\nTwitter and Musk spoke Sunday and into the early hours Monday, The New York Times reported, less than two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform that he uses to promote his interests, attack critics and opine on social and economic issues to his more than 83 million followers.\n\nMusk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal. Musk hasn\'t commented on the negotiations but on Monday waded into the buzz about them on Twitter, where some users are promising to quit the platform if he takes over.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he tweeted.\n\nMusk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has voiced a number of proposed changes for the company, from relaxing its content restrictions — such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump’s account — to ridding the platform of fake and automated accounts, and shifting away from its advertising-based revenue model.\n\nTwitter’s board has flexibility in judging Musk’s proposal not just on the finances but also the specifics of his business plan and how it could affect users, advertisers and employees — some of whom might leave, said Kevin Kaiser, a finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“What’s critical for the board is whether they think it’s in the best interest of the company,” Kaiser said. “That can come from many, many factors.”\n\nKaiser said the board could decide that Musk’s plan has “too many negative impacts,” but that would be a hard case to make given how much Musk is offering to pay.\n\nAsked during a recent TED talk if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter or any forum is “obviously bound by the laws of the country that it operates in. So obviously there are some limitations on free speech in the US, and, of course, Twitter would have to abide by those rules.”\n\nBeyond that, though, he said he’d be “very reluctant” to delete things and in general be cautious about permanent bans.\n\nIt won’t be perfect, Musk added, “but I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible."\n\nTwitter had initially enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But the board decided to negotiate after Musk updated his proposal last week to show he had secured financing, according to The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the negotiations were underway.\n\nA rival bidder to Musk may not be stepping up any time soon, fearful of the byzantine task of moderating content on the platform, something that Musk has vowed to do less of.\n\n“The Twitter Board could not find a white knight and with Musk’s financing detailed the clock has essentially struck midnight for the board which is why negotiations have begun to get a deal done,” said Dan Ives, who follows Twitter for Wedbush Securities.\n\nThe Times, citing people with knowledge of the situation who it did not identify, said the two sides were discussing details including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart. The people said the situation was fluid and fast-moving.\n\nWhile Twitter’s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as Facebook and TikTok, the service is popular with celebrities, world leaders, journalists and intellectuals. Musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. rose 5% Monday to $51.50 per share. On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy the social media platform for $54.20 per share, or about $43 billion, but did not say at the time how he would finance the acquisition.\n\nLast week, he said in documents filed with U.S. securities regulators that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in Tesla.\n\nTwitter has not commented.\n\nMusk is the world’s wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a nearly $279 billion fortune. But much of his money is tied up in Tesla stock — he owns about 17% of the electric car company, according to FactSet, which is valued at more than $1 trillion — and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It’s unclear how much cash Musk has.\n\nMusk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, to Compaq for $307 million. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly. It was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nThat same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting NASA’s interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets.\n\nIn 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car.

Musk said other investors could contribute to the financing.\n\nThe locked-in financing not only underscored the seriousness of Musk\'s pursuit, but also appeared to open the door to other large Twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the San Francisco company.\n\nThe details of those conversations aren’t known, but Musk could point to a more than 20-year history building and running several businesses — most notably as the longtime CEO of Tesla. The electric car maker is currently valued at $1 trillion -- roughly 25 times more than Twitter.\n\n“I think there is nothing better for Twitter than Elon Musk buying it and ideally replacing the board, and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue-generating sources," said John Meyer, a technology entrepreneur and investor. “Musk has the track record that he can do the impossible."\n\nIt would be easy to see why other Twitter shareholders might welcome a shake-up, as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment. Before Musk disclosed his 9% stake in Twitter earlier this month, the shares were trading below $40 — not that much more it its $26 price when Twitter went public in November 2013. Since then, the tech-driven Nasdaq has more than tripled, even after a recent downturn. Twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising, Google and Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla’s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010. And after struggling to make money for more than a decade, the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of $3.3 billion during the first three months of this year alone.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nAs is customary once a company agrees to be acquired, the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren’t any red flags that haven’t come up via the company’s public filings.\n\nThis step in the process isn’t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal, said Angelo Zino, tech analyst at CFRA.\n\n“He’s acquiring this company, not from a financial perspective,” Zino said. “He’s going to do what he wants with it and he’s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company.”\n\nWHAT SAY COULD REGULATORS HAVE?\n\nLast year, Twitter generated $5 billion in revenue, with $2.8 billion from the U.S. and the rest earned overseas, Zino said. The Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., or the European Commission in the EU, are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed Twitter buyout.\n\nThe main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry, or whether it violates antitrust laws.\n\nThese reviews can take months, or longer, but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining, or in the case of a single buyer, whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry.\n\nNeither Tesla, nor Musk’s other company, Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, are social media platforms, so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal, analysts said.\n\n“We do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with Musk owning Twitter,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Monday.\n\nWHEN DO SHAREHOLDERS GET TO VOTE?\n\nThe deal is expected to close in 2022, subject to the approval of Twitter shareholders. Twitter hasn’t announced the timing of a shareholder vote, though the company’s annual meeting is set for May 25, which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders.\n\nA company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time, even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TWITTER LEADERSHIP?\n\nAt this early stage, it’s unclear what will happen to Twitter\'s current board or management team if the deal is completed, but Musk has made it abundantly clear that he believes the company has been poorly run. That assessment is a strong indication that Musk’s makeover will also include a purge of Twitter’s top ranks.', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:56'}

Subsequent events put that moniker to the test, as repressive regimes cracked down on Twitter users, particularly in the wake of the short-lived “Arab Spring” demonstrations. In the U.S., a visceral 2014 article by journalist Amanda Hess exposed the incessant, vile harassment many women faced just for posting on Twitter or other online forums.\n\nOver the subsequent years, Twitter learned a few things about the consequences of running a largely unmoderated social platform — one of the most important being that companies generally don't want their ads running against violent threats, hate speech that bleeds into incitement, and misinformation that aims to tip elections or undermine public health.\n\n“With Musk, his posturing of free speech — just leave everything up — that would be bad in and of itself,” said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. “If you stop moderating with automated systems and human reviews, a site like Twitter, in the space of a short period of time, you would have a cesspool.”\n\nGoogle, Barrett pointed out, quickly learned this lesson the hard way when major companies like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch yanked their ads after they ran ahead of YouTube videos produced by extremists in 2015.\n\nOnce it was clear just how unhealthy the conversation had gotten, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey spent years trying to improve what he called the “health” of the conversation on the platform.\n\nThe company was an early adopter of the “report abuse” button after U.K. member of parliament Stella Creasy received a barrage of rape and death threats on the platform. The online abuse was the result of a seemingly positive tweet in support of feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully advocated for novelist Jane Austen to appear on a British banknote. Creasy’s online harasser was sent to prison for 18 weeks.\n\nTwitter has continued to craft rules and invested in staff and technology that detect violent threats, harassment and misinformation that violates its policies. After evidence emerged that Russia used their platforms to try to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social media companies also stepped up their efforts against political misinformation.\n\nThe big question now is how far Musk, who describes himself as a “free-speech absolutist,” wants to ratchet back these systems — and whether users and advertisers will stick around if he does.\n\nEven now, Americans say they’re more likely to be harassed on social media than any other online forum, with women, people of color and LGBTQ users reporting a disproportionate amount of that abuse. Roughly 80% of users believe the companies are still doing only a “fair or poor” job of handling that harassment, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults last year.\n\nMeanwhile, terms like “censorship” and “free speech” have turned into political rallying cries for conservatives, frustrated by seeing right-leaning commentators and high-profile Republican officials booted off Facebook and Twitter for violating their rules.\n\nMusk appeared to criticize Twitter’s permanent ban of President Donald Trump last year for messages that the tech company said helped incite the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last year.\n\n“A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech,” Musk tweeted days after Trump was banned from both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nTrump’s allies, including his son Donald Trump Jr., have even pleaded for Musk to buy out the company.\n\n“If Elon Musk can privately send people into space I’m sure he can design a social network that isn’t biased,” Trump Jr. said in the caption of a video posted to Instagram last April.\n\nKirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame, said Twitter has consistently worked at being a “responsible” social media company through its moderation system, its hires in the area of machine learning ethics and in whom they allow to do research on the platform. The fact that Musk wants to change that, she added, suggests that he's focused on “irresponsible social media.”\n\nTwitter declined to comment for this story. A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to a message for comment.\n\nNew social media apps targeted at conservatives, including Trump’s Truth Social, haven't come remotely close to matching the success of Facebook or Twitter. That's partly because Republican politicians, politicians and causes already draw large audiences on existing, and much better established, platforms.\n\nIt's also partly due to floods of inflammatory, false or violent posts. Last year, for example, right-wing social media site Parler was nearly wiped off the internet when it became evident that rioters had used the app to promote violent messages and organize the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol. Apple and Google barred its app from their online stores, while Amazon stopped providing web-hosting services for the site.\n\nMusk himself regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and sometimes bullies reporters who have written critical articles about him or Tesla. He regularly tweets at reporters who write about his company, sometimes mischaracterizing their work as “false” or “misleading.”\n\nHis popular tweets typically send a swarm of his social media fans directly to the accounts of the reporters to harass them for hours or days.\n\n“I only block people as a direct insult,” Musk tweeted in 2020, responding to a tweet from a reporter.\n\nEvan Greer, a political activist with Fight for the Future, said Musk’s lack of experience in moderating an influential social media platform will be a problem if he successfully takes over the company.\n\n“If we want to protect free speech online, then we can’t live in a world where the richest person on Earth can just purchase a platform that millions of people depend on and then change the rules to his liking,” Greer said.", 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:34'}

The race to the bottom begins,” Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning Media Matters for America, said in a statement.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), using her official account, suggested that after Musk “seals the deal” she will get access to her personal account “restored” after it was banned in January for repeated violations of Twitter’s COVID-19 misinformation policy.\n\nTrump said Monday he would not return to Twitter but would remain on his own platform, Truth Social. However, some of Trump’s advisers told The Washington Post they don’t think he would turn down an offer to return to the platform that brought him so much attention during his campaign and term.\n\nMedia Matters compiled a list of banned Twitter users, including Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander and prominent QAnon figures celebrating Musk’s takeover, that critics believe could pose a threat if allowed back on the platform.\n\n“These folks are organized,” said Jessica González, co-CEO of Free Press and co-founder of Change the Terms.\n\n“I’m really talking about sophisticated, coordinated … efforts to use these platforms to radicalize people, to raise funds, to normalize violence and to issue calls to action for violent and threatening activity that happens in real life,” she added.\n\nLeadership changes\n\nWhile Musk and Twitter did agree on a deal for taking the company private on Monday, the purchase itself may take until the end of 2022 to wrap up while shareholders vote on the agreement and regulatory hurdles are cleared.\n\nDuring that time, CEO Parag Agrawal and the independent board that approved the offer will remain in charge of Twitter.\n\n“I think we feel very comfortable that [the deal] gives this team the ability to continue to make the company successful in between signing and closing the transaction,” Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter’s board of directors, reportedly said during a company-wide town hall Monday evening.\n\nOnce the deal is closed however, a shakeup at the top of the company seems likely.\n\nMusk’s relationship with current leadership has not been publicly confrontational. But Musk did reject their offer to join the board, an indication that he might be interested in pursuing his own vision of the platform.\n\nAgrawal will be in line for a $38.7 million pay package if the deal goes through and Musk chooses to terminate him.\n\nIt would be difficult for Musk to head the company alone given his active leadership or involvement in Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink.\n\nWhom Musk chooses to head Twitter if he refreshes current leadership could be the clearest signal of his plans for the platform.\n\n“Once the deal closes, we don’t know which direction the platform will go,” Agrawal reportedly admitted during Monday’s town hall.\n\nHow could the product change?\n\nMajor changes are likely to wait until the deal is completed.\n\nMusk has given some hints to what those could look like beyond his commitment to “free speech.”\n\n“I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,” he said in a statement on the deal’s announcement.\n\nMusk has said that algorithms that make recommendations to users on what accounts to follow, posts to view or topics to read up on should be opened to public viewing.\n\nSuch a move could assuage concerns about political bias on the platform and give researchers much-needed access to social media’s levers.\n\nBut Twitter has already been very open about the effect of its algorithms. The company released a study in the fall finding that they tend to amplify right-leaning politicians more than their counterparts.\n\nFully publishing complex algorithms could not only lead to confusion, but open the platform up to cybersecurity risks.\n\nMusk has been very vocal about his desire to cut down on spam on Twitter but has given few specifics about how he would do.\n\nMusk’s proposal to authenticate all humans on Twitter has also prompted worry from civil society groups.\n\nSimple checks like CAPTCHAs before posting would likely be gameable with spam bots, while more stringent checks like ID verification would destroy the pseudonymity that Twitter has worked hard to maintain.\n\nEven if users are not required to post their real names on the platform, that data will have to be collected by Twitter and, therefore, could be compelled by governments to turn it over.\n\nThe impacts on free speech and the right to protest, especially in authoritarian states that already have rules against government criticism on social media, could be devastating.\n\n“There are no easy ways to require verification without wreaking havoc for some users, and for free speech,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in statement.\n\nWashington’s ire\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are using Musk’s takeover to fuel their respective battles against powerful tech companies.\n\nRepublicans are embracing Musk as an ally in their fight against “Big Tech overlords.”\n\n“Elon Musk is helping us defeat the Big Tech overlords. Our digital public squares need to be returned to us,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) tweeted.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) echoed Musk’s own words, saying the platform’s “full potential” will be unlocked if Musk can change the platform to “actually protect free speech and encourage open discourse.”\n\nThe GOP support builds on years of attacks on Twitter over claims of the platform censoring content with an anti-conservative bias.\n\nBut Democrats say Musk’s ownership raises additional concerns about the spread of disinformation.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told The Hill.\n\nSome progressives are using Musk’s takeover to push for a wealth tax and elevate concerns about power consolidation.\n\n“This deal is dangerous for our democracy. Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain. We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted.\n\nHow will Twitter’s workers respond?\n\nTwitter has long been known as one of the most open places to work in Silicon Valley.\n\nWorkers have been encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings on the platform for years. Many of them did just that Monday as news of the deal broke, expressing confusion and dismay.\n\n“Can someone just tell me if I’m rich or fired please,” one said.\n\n“The news today is so crazy I literally forgot I have COVID,” posted another.\n\nThe majority of the company’s 5,000-plus employees work in liberal San Francisco and, until now, have worked for a platform known for its aggressive approach to content moderation.\n\nThe company has led social media competitors in reacting to Trump’s dissemination of election disinformation and the spread of misinformation about COVID-19.\n\nMusk’s version of free speech appears to run counter to that approach, setting up potential ideological clashes.\n\nThe company reportedly took a precautionary measure Monday by temporarily freezing changes to the platform until next week.

It is a reminder why we need a wealth tax and why we need some serious regulation for Big Tech. One billionaire should not be able to turn the world upside down just because he plays by a different set of rules,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who believes the government should break up Big Tech companies to promote more competition.\n\nAsked whether Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was cause for concern, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said: “Absolutely it does.”\n\n“He said he wants to make it this global message board. My first question to him, ‘Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?’ ” he said. “That’s a key question. If he lets that man rant and rave on Twitter, not in the best interests of America’s’ future.”\n\nDurbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that his and other panels are exploring whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on Big Tech companies to incentivize them to do more to moderate content.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford last week, Obama said tech firms “need to be more transparent about how they operate” and crack down on “lies and conspiracy theories” that threaten the nation’s democratic system.\n\n“Without some standards, implications of this technology — for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order — are frightening and profound,” he warned.\n\nMusk hasn’t said whether he’ll let Trump, who was permanently barred from Twitter in January 2021, back on the platform, but his recent comments have fueled speculation that he might do so. Trump has indicated he’s not interested in getting back on Twitter, though he is known for changing his mind.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he also had concerns about what Musk’s purchase of Twitter might mean for the platform’s content standards.\n\nHe said he was looking into the matter but declined to provide any detail.\n\n“I’ve got some concerns. I think it will have to go through … some level of appropriate regulatory [review], and I’m doing some of my own checking,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said Musk’s control over a major forum for political debate is alarming.\n\n“It’s always a concern when an oligarch may be owning the town square. I think we do need to pay a lot of attention to how it’s managed,” he said.\n\nMusk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions about what it means for his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over fraud charges stemming from his August 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which pushed the car company’s stock higher.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk must allow a Tesla lawyer to review any tweets containing material business information before hitting the send button.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said allowing Trump back on Twitter would be a major problem.\n\n“I think that’s very problematic,” she said of Trump’s possible return. “I don’t think that somebody who encouraged and organized a violent insurrection to take over our government should be allowed on Twitter.”\n\nAsked about the loosening of content standards, she said she “would certainly have concerns” but added she hadn’t looked at the deal closely enough to “get into a big analysis.”\n\nTrump, who has launched a social media venture that includes a platform intended to vie with Twitter, told Fox News on Monday that he doesn’t plan to return to Twitter.\n\n“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” he said, referring to his Truth Social messaging platform, before the deal was announced. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth. The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.”\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump because of what it called “the risk of further incitement of violence” after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory.\n\nTwitter later unveiled a civic integrity policy that prohibited the use of its services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. It also reserved the right to flag or reduce the visibility of tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes.\n\nAt a TED conference this month, Musk stressed the importance of allowing free speech on Twitter.\n\n“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” he said.\n\nConservatives on Monday applauded Musk’s move.\n\n“Elon Musk did his part for free speech today. Let’s hope the Supreme Court does as well,” former Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.), a conservative Republican running for Senate, tweeted Monday afternoon.\n\nDemocrats are worried what that means for policing claims that Biden stole the 2020 presidential election or misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“I’m a big free speech guy, but this stuff isn’t working. It’s terrorizing democracy, and from that perspective I think it’s bad for Democrats in this sense: These Republican alt groups tend to dominate. They tend to have much more of a footprint on these social media platforms than Democrats do,” said Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nJarding is also the communications director for a new social media platform called Pixstory, which has a business model designed to root out hate and misinformation by giving integrity scores to people who post on the site.\n\nBut Jarding called it “a horrible problem” that the world’s richest person is taking over a major means of political discourse at a time when Democrats are discussing proposals to tax the unrealized capital gains of multibillionaires such as Musk to pay for proposals to fight climate change and economic inequality.\n\n“He could turn it into anything that he wants. He controls literally hundreds of millions of hits, if you will, or clicks on a platform that he can determine whether it’s used in a good way or a bad way, and that’s too much concentration with one individual,” Jarding added.', 'image': 'https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/stabenowdebbie_020922arl.jpg?w=1280', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:11'}

Only a quarter of respondents said they thought that Musk would make Twitter a better place, just ten per cent thought Twitter content moderation practices are too strict, and just over a third said Twitter\'s algorithms should be open sourced. The majority did say they wanted spam bots eliminated, and to be able to edit tweets after posting – two changes Musk has pledged to enact.\n\nThe mood inside Twitter is one of uncertainty: employees say they\'ve been left in the dark, and are worried that a stock buyout will lead to long-term financial losses for some Twitter employees, many of whom make 50 per cent of their income on stock options.\n\nAnalyst opinions are also uncertain what sort of financial impact the sale will have on Twitter itself, which stands to lose a good chunk of its revenue to Musk\'s loans: it\'ll likely cost the company around $1 billion per year in debt servicing costs – see the Twitter thread below – and it recorded $5.08 billion revenue in 2021. ®\n\nTwitter will have about $1 billion in interest payments due annually after this buyout – and its cash flows are projected to be about $1.43 billion this year and $1.85 billion in 2023.

Wall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers.\n\nThe deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9% stake in the platform. Musk said last week that he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\n\nTwitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. rose more than 5% Monday to $51.70 per share. On April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share. While the stock is up sharply since Musk made his offer, it is well below the high of $77 per share it reached in February 2021.\n\nMusk has described himself as a “free-speech absolutist” but is also known for blocking or disparaging other Twitter users who question or disagree with him.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has proposed relaxing Twitter content restrictions — such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump’s account — while ridding the platform of fake “spambot” accounts and shifting away advertising as its primary revenue model. Musk believes he can increase revenue through subscriptions that give paying customers a better experience — possibly even an ad-free version of Twitter.\n\nAsked during a recent TED interview if there are any limits to his notion of “free speech,” Musk said Twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world. Beyond that, he said, he’d be “very reluctant” to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company’s rules.\n\nIt won’t be perfect, Musk added, “but I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible.”\n\nAfter the deal was announced, the NAACP released a statement urging Musk not to allow Trump, the 45th president, back onto the platform.\n\n“Do not allow 45 to return to the platform,” the civil rights organization said in a statement. “Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy.”\n\nAs both candidate and president, Trump made Twitter a powerful megaphone for speaking directly to the public, often using incendiary and divisive language on hot-button issues. He was permanently banned from the service in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisers, currently Twitter’s main customers, have also pushed for the stronger content rules Musk has criticized. Keeping them happy requires moderation limiting hate speech so that brands aren’t trying to promote their products next to “calls for genocide,” said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.\n\n“If Musk either fires or drives away the team at Twitter that’s committed to keeping it clean and making it less hate-filled, he’ll see an immediate drop in user activity,” said Vaidhyanathan. “I think he’s going to find pretty fast that inviting the bigots back in is bad for business.”\n\nSome users said Monday that they were planning to quit the platform if Musk took it over. To which he responded on Twitter: “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nMusk has also run into trouble with federal officials as a result of his own tweets, some of which he’s used to taunt regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting. More recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition.\n\nWhile Twitter’s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as Facebook and TikTok, the service is popular with celebrities, world leaders, journalists and intellectuals. Musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts.\n\nLast week, he said in SEC documents that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in Tesla, the electric-vehicle company he runs.\n\nMusk has a fortune of nearly $268 billion, much of which is tied up in Tesla stock and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It’s unclear how much cash Musk holds.\n\nMusk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, to Compaq for $307 million. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly. It was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nThat same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting NASA’s interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets.\n\nIn 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to astronomical success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles.\n\nMusk’s pledge to make Twitter a haven for free speech could dim the appeal of Donald Trump’s troubled Truth Social app, which the former president has touted as a competitor to Twitter that would cater to conservatives. Truth Social is part of Trump’s new media company, which has agreed to be taken public by Digital World Acquisition Corp. Shares of DWAC dropped 16.2% Monday and are down 46% since Musk revealed his stake in Twitter.\n\n__\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit. O’Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

The sale agreement was announced hours after reports that a deal between Twitter and Musk was close.\n\nThe deal is "a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion," the announcement said.

For others who worry that Musk will give free rein to agitators who spew hate, lies and other harmful content, making the platform too toxic for advertisers and average users, Musk has offered few assurances.\n\n“The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all,” he tweeted Tuesday\n\nMany of Musk’s proposed changes reflect his own experience as a high-profile and outspoken Twitter user with more than 85 million followers and a swarm of pesky impersonator accounts that use his name and photo to promote cryptocurrency schemes. The statement announcing his acquisition of Twitter on Monday highlighted the need to defeat “spam bots” that mimic real users.\n\nBut what about Twitter’s more than 200 million other users who aren’t getting banned or flooded with spam? There’s still a lot of uncertainty about whether his ideas are technologically feasible and whether these changes would benefit most regular users, or serve some other purpose.\n\n“He’s made it pretty clear he’s not interested in making Twitter a profitable enterprise," said Joan Donovan, who studies misinformation at Harvard University. “It’s about the power and the influence of Twitter itself and its importance in our culture."\n\nExperts who have studied content moderation and researched Twitter for years have expressed doubt that Musk knows exactly what he is getting into. And some of the problems he has identified aren\'t felt by most users.\n\n“The spam bots, for him, are highly visible and somewhat personal,” said Donovan. “Most people don’t see a lot of these spammy accounts.”\n\nAnd for those unhappy with the company\'s crackdown on hate, harassment and misinformation, there are plenty of fledgling examples of “free speech”-focused social media platforms that have been launched in the past few years as Twitter antidotes, largely by conservatives. Many have struggled to deal with toxic content, and at least one has been cut off by its own technology providers in protest.\n\n“This move just shows how effective (moderation features) have been to annoy those in power,” said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. “I would be worried as to how this would change Twitter’s values.”\n\nThe fact that no other bidders emerged in public before Musk’s deal was a sign that other would-be acquirers might find Twitter too difficult to improve, said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.\n\n“This platform is pretty much the same one we’ve had over the last decade or so," Kessler said. "You’ve had a lot of smart people trying to figure out what they should do, and they’ve had trouble. It’s probably going to be tough to make a lot of headway.”\n\nBut others familiar with Twitter say they\'re dismayed at Musk\'s successful bid for the company.\n\n“Twitter is going to let a man-child essentially take over their platform,” said Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who has also worked for Google and Apple. Miley, who was the only Black engineer at Twitter in a leadership position when he left the company in 2015, echoed doubts about Musk\'s grasp of the platform\'s complexities.\n\n“I am not sure if Elon knows what he is getting,” Miley said. “He may just find that having Twitter is a lot different than wanting Twitter.”\n\nThe more hands-off approach to content moderation that Musk envisions has many users concerned that the platform will reanimate accounts that propagated dangerous conspiracies and harassment.\n\nWall Street analysts said if he goes too far, it could also alienate advertisers — Twitter\'s chief revenue source. And it could make it harder to retain the San Francisco-based company\'s more than 7,500 employees, some of whom are already voicing concerns about the possibility of a backslide on content standards.\n\nIn Europe, officials reminded Musk about a new law, the Digital Services Act, that will force tech companies to step up policing of their online platforms.\n\n“Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules – regardless of their shareholding,” tweeted Thierry Breton, the European Union commissioner in charge of the bloc’s internal market. “Mr. Musk knows this well. He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.”\n\nMusk’s takeover is not yet a done deal and still awaits the approval of a majority of Twitter\'s stockholders. Twitter previously scheduled its annual shareholders meeting for May 25, but a regulatory filing Tuesday said the company will be convening a special meeting “as promptly as reasonably practicable."\n\nWhile there are likely to be some bumps along the way, there don\'t appear to be serious enough obstacles to stop the deal, according to Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\n\nTwitter or Musk can walk away from the deal if it’s not completed by Oct. 24, but if either Musk or Twitter is deemed responsible for the deal not going forward, they would have to pay a $1 billion termination fee, according to details of the transaction contained in a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The filing also showed that Twitter will drop a “poison pill” measure it had earlier adopted to defend against Musk\'s takeover by making it prohibitively expensive.\n\nNormally when companies go private, dissenting shareholders are forcibly cashed out. Some could challenge the stock price in court, contending that Musk should pay more, but that probably won’t hold up the sale, Elson said.\n\nIt’s likely that Musk would dissolve the current board and replace it with a new one that would agree with his management direction. And once Twitter is private, Musk will face fewer gripes from shareholders that often bring lawsuits, Elson said. Private companies also don’t face as much scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been a finger in Musk’s eye for years, often because of statements he\'s made on Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, shares of Twitter traded just under $50, below the $54.20 purchase price. Twitter will offer a glimpse into the health of its business when it reports its quarterly financial results Thursday.\n\nTwitter\'s constituents aren\'t the only ones anxious about Musk\'s $44 billion investment.\n\nShares of Musk\'s electric car company, Tesla, have lost about 19% of their value since Musk announced his stake in Twitter, including about a 12% decline on Tuesday. Analysts say investors are fearful that Musk will be distracted by the social media company and less engaged in running Tesla.\n\n“He’s going to be spending more time with another venture,” Edward Jones Senior Equity Analyst Jeff Windau said of Musk, who also runs SpaceX, The Boring Co., which digs tunnels, and Neuralink, a computer-brain interface company. “There’s a potential limit on the amount of bandwidth that you can apply to each of these companies."\n\n——\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit.

They may also reveal clues as to how Musk will govern the platform he hopes to own.\n\n“Look at the feed: It\'s all over the place. It\'s erratic. At times it\'s pretty extreme,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media and who recently assigned Musk\'s tweets as reading material for their students. “It paints him as some sort of rebel leader who will take control of the public square to save it. That is a myth he has constructed.”\n\nMusk joined Twitter in 2010 and now has more than 85 million followers — the seventh most of any account and the highest for any business leader. He had mused about buying the site before he agreed on Monday to pay $44 billion for Twitter, which he said he hopes to turn into a haven where all speech is allowed.\n\n“I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk wrote in a tweet.\n\nAs the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk uses his Twitter account to make business announcements and promote his enterprises. He muses about technology and trade, but has also posted jokes about women\'s breasts and once compared Canada\'s prime minister to Hitler. He regularly weighs in on global events, as he did in March 2020 when he tweeted that “The coronavirus pandemic is dumb."\n\nHe\'s also used the account to punch back at critics, such as when he called a diver working to rescue boys trapped in a cave in Thailand a “pedo," short for pedophile. The diver had previously criticized Musk\'s proposal to use a sub to rescue the boys. Musk, who won a defamation suit filed by the diver, later said he never intended “pedo” to be interpreted as “pedophile.”\n\nA few years ago, after software engineer Cher Scarlett criticized Musk\'s handling of the cave incident, the tech billionaire fired back and she was soon being harassed by dozens of Musk\'s online fans. He later deleted the posts, but not before Scarlett had to lock down her account because she was receiving so many hateful messages.\n\n“It\'s ironic to me that somebody who claims they want to buy Twitter to protect free speech has such thin skin,” she said. “He\'s a very smart man, and when he replies to people that criticize him, he knows what he\'s doing. To me that\'s not championing free speech, it\'s weaponizing free speech, and I think that\'s what he\'ll do owning this platform.”\n\nNineteen-year-old Jack Sweeney got Musk\'s attention when he created an automated Twitter account that tracked the movements of Musk\'s jet. Musk responded by offering Sweeney $5,000 to pull the account. When Sweeney refused, Musk blocked him on Twitter.\n\nSweeney said he\'s worried he may get kicked off the site entirely if Musk\'s takeover is approved. But he said he likes Musk\'s free speech absolutism, and hopes he sees it through.\n\n“He’ll make it more open, and I think that\'s a good thing,” Sweeney said.\n\nMusk\'s use of Twitter has also led to problems for his own companies. In one August 2018 tweet, for instance, Musk asserted that he had the funding to take Tesla private for $420 a share, although a court has ruled that it wasn’t true. That led to an SEC investigation that Musk is still fighting.\n\nMore recently, Musk appeared to have violated SEC rules that required him to disclose that he’d acquired a 5% stake in Twitter; instead he waited until he had more than 9%. Experts say these issues aren’t likely to affect his Twitter acquisition.\n\nLast year another federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, ordered Musk to delete a tweet that officials said illegally threatened to cut stock options for Tesla employees who joined the United Auto Workers union.\n\nThose tweets helped cement Musk\'s reputation as a brash outsider, a workingman\'s billionaire, Grygiel said. But that doesn\'t mean he is equipped to run a social media platform with more than 200 million users, the professor added.\n\n“Maybe he wants to burn it down,” Grygiel said. “I don\'t know. But I do know that it shows that no one person should have this kind of power.”', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:46'}

Melber warns that Elon Musk might actually use Twitter to “secretly ban” or “turn down the reach” of a political party or candidate. That is apparently worse than Twitter openly banning candidates and suspending accounts of conservatives for years. Melber is warning the left that Twitter could be used against them . . . the way it has been used against their opponents. He emphasized “this thing matters a ton.” That is a ton more than it mattered for the last six years.\n\nMelber warned his viewers that\n\n“If you own all of Twitter or Facebook or what have you, you don’t have to explain yourself, you don’t even have to be transparent, you could secretly ban one party’s candidate or all of its candidates, all of it nominees. Or you could just secretly turn down the reach of their stuff and turn up the reach of something else and the rest of us might not even find about it til after the election.”\n\nThat is precisely what Twitter has been doing without a whimper of objection from most pundits on the left.\n\nMelber actually warns that Musk might secretly ban political figures while warning that Donald Trump will have his ban lifted by Musk. While Trump said that he will not return to Twitter, Melber is worried that he could be allowed to tweet again.\n\nNone of this was a threat to democracy when Twitter was suspending dozens of political figures and commentators, including the President of the United States.\n\nHowever, now it is dire as Musk threatens to restore free speech protections to the platform:\n\n“It’s true if you are a democracy like the United States that used to regulate media ownership and say Rupert Murdoch can’t have too many local TV stations and newspapers in one town, they have laws for that are still on the books. Congress hasn’t gotten round to limiting whether someone can own all of Twitter.”\n\nSo media figures are calling for government regulation of media after the first major victory against corporate censorship. Musk may prove a fraud or he prove a champion of free speech. Yet, it is hard to see the downside given the massive censorship system now imposed across social media. There remain media figures who would prefer censorship to the outbreak of free speech.\n\nIt seems that, when it comes to free speech, there are simply some people you cannot reach.', 'image': 'http://img.youtube.com/vi/lAR2GCCzB7k/0.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:29'}

For more info, visit our Terms of Use page\n\nFacing a multitude of threats to systems and data, everyone from small and medium businesses to large enterprises and nonprofits are turning to cloud backup and recovery services. Combining both data backup protections and recovery capabilities, disaster recovery as a service solutions help ensure continued operations should a catastrophe, failure, accident or other adverse event occur.\n\nJump to:\n\nSEE: Hiring Kit: Database engineer (TechRepublic Premium)\n\nWhat is disaster recovery as a service?\n\nDRaaS is a cloud computing strategy in which an organization pays a provider to protect the organization’s data and information from disruption ⏤ due either to natural disasters, human error or cyberattacks ⏤ by enabling full operational recovery using a cloud-based solution.\n\nHow does DRaaS work?\n\nDRaaS works in various ways. In some cases, a disaster recovery services vendor will leverage a small appliance installed on-premises at a client’s site. These appliances collect backup images and send backup information offsite where it can later be used to recover operations at a new location. In other cases, DRaaS solutions target continuous data replication to permit spinning up disaster recovery services in the cloud or at another location.\n\nRegardless of the data backup and synchronization strategy, most DRaaS solutions offer many common capabilities, including encrypted data transfer, offsite replication, emergency recovery and maintenance.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using DRaaS?\n\nThe benefits of using DRaaS are that organizations can integrate these cloud-based services within their larger business continuity and disaster recovery plans to properly protect systems, applications and data in a way that also fulfills their specific disaster recovery requirements.\n\nProper and effective disaster planning requires addressing numerous elements, such as system, application and data backups, safe storage of those backups, and quick recovery. DRaaS providers offer a complete smorgasbord of options to organizations of all sizes operating across all industries. These providers tailor their DRaaS solutions to an organization’s specific needs.\n\nA small advertising firm may survive if recovery operations take several days. However, a large accounting firm might need to return to regular operation in just an hour were a disaster to occur during the height of tax season.\n\nTop DRaaS providers and solutions\n\nAcronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect\n\nAcronis offers a variety of cloud-based data protection and recovery solutions. While some Acronis products, such as Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud, are designed for managed services providers to wield assisting customers, still others are built specifically for businesses and organizations.\n\nPaired together, two Acronis products provide organizations with a powerful one-two punch. Known as Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect, this DRaaS solution creates a powerful combination to both protect data and applications and enable disaster recovery.\n\nThe primary product, Acronis Cyber Protect, gives businesses potent backup and recovery software that also includes integrated cybersecurity features. Its single console simplifies managing data and endpoint protection, reducing administration overhead while identifying and resolving issues. Starting at $79 for small- and medium-size environments, the software permits making image, file and local backups. The platform permits bare metal recovery and the recovery of production systems to dissimilar hardware. It is compatible within Windows, Linux, VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V environments.\n\nAdding another Acronis solution, Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery, boosts effectiveness. The service adds a streamlined disaster recovery process in which testing failover and failback of protected data, applications and systems is both enabled and simplified.\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery add-on also enables other critical capabilities. Using the add-on, administrators can customize recovery point objectives that help ensure the most current data is recovered. In the event of a disaster, the add-on also permits recovering and running an organization’s operations directly from Acronis’ cloud server environment. Such potentialities prove critical in the event of floods, fires, tornados and other disasters.\n\nPricing depends upon a number of variables, including the number of protected machines and the amount of data being stored. Firms can test the solution for free for 30 days.\n\nContact Acronis directly at 1-781-782-9000 for more information or with questions.\n\nCarbonite Recover\n\nBoasting push-button failover, Carbonite Recover is a DRaaS offering that reduces the risks of unplanned downtime and operations interruption by securely replicating critical applications and data to the Carbonite cloud. Subsequently, an up-to-date production environment becomes available for immediate failover.\n\nUsing Carbonite’s solution, primary servers can replicate in real-time, at the individual byte level, to the DRaaS cloud (Figure A). Organizations can perform their own non-disruptive, self-service tests, and access and view failover reporting. In the event organizations need more assistance, Carbonite’s technical services team can also provide support, including for deployment, testing and recovery.\n\nFigure A\n\nThe solution works by installing a Carbonite Recovery agent on each system to be protected. Following service configuration, those systems then begin sending encrypted data continuously, and with little adverse performance impact according to the vendor, to the Carbonite cloud.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, organizations can spin up the cloud-based replicas to recover operations. Then, once an organization is ready to return to using its primary production systems, the process is essentially reversed.\n\nSupported across a variety of environments, including Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, VMware and Hyper-V, pricing is based on the number of endpoints, the amount of data and the types of assistive services the organization selects.\n\nContact Carbonite directly at 1-877-542-8637 for more information or with questions.\n\nDatto ALTO & SIRIS\n\nDatto, whose acquisition by Kaseya was announced in April 2022, provides a range of DRaaS and BCDR offerings for MSPs (Figure B). The company’s ALTO and SIRIS solutions provide data protection solutions that also include full BCDR capabilities.\n\nFigure B\n\nDatto ALTO is a cost-effective and reliable hardware device that replicates an on-premises server and supports up to four Datto agents. The device serves as an onsite backup, but the solution also includes cloud-backup capabilities. Holding up to 2TB of data, customers can run operations from the device itself or from Datto’s cloud.\n\nDatto SIRIS is similar to ALTO except SIRIS permits managing an unlimited number of agents for accommodating more servers and virtual machines, including VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V VMs. SIRIS is scalable, as up to 120TB can also be backed up using the solution. With SIRIS, backups can be performed as frequently as every five minutes, including on Windows, Linux and Mac machines.\n\nDesigned for larger environments, Datto SIRIS supports physical, virtual and cloud infrastructure, permits restoring data from any point in time and enables replicating server images directly to the cloud. Ransomware protection, flexible restoration and indefinite cloud retention are other features.\n\nCost varies by the product and amount of data stored. Although Datto takes pains to simplify pricing, the firm works directly with MSPs, who are permitted to customize their own pricing plans. Because pricing can be included within MSP’s regular recurring monthly service agreements, organizations working with an MSP can wrap the DRaaS pricing directly within a monthly service contract, should an organization choose to do so.\n\nContact Datto for more information or to find a reseller at 1-888-294-6312.\n\nDRaaS Tierpoint\n\nTierPoint Disaster Recovery as a Service sells its DRaaS services directly to businesses. With customizable disaster recovery services, the firm aims to assist a variety of organizations, whether those firms require cloud-to-cloud recovery, on-premises or data center server-to-cloud recovery.\n\nDepending upon the service chosen, TierPoint leverages Dell Technologies’ Recover Point for VMs, Nutanix’s native DR platform, VMware’s vCloud Availability or Zerto’s IT Resiliency Platform. Permitting replicating from any cloud to a TierPoint cloud within an organization’s region, this DRaaS platform permits backing up and exchanging data from anywhere while also meeting VM-level near-synchronous replication to minimize any chance for data loss.\n\nTierPoint’s DRaaS offering also offers automatic failover, permitting recovery in just minutes at a secondary site.

Blockchain technology enables retailers to use smart contracts to resolve customer disputes without the intervention of a court. Smart contracts are stored in a digital ledger, allowing customers to securely record all transactions on the blockchain ecosystem, such as receipts, warranty documents, and insurance papers. The transaction is open to the public and cannot be changed or tampered with. All parties involved in the transaction are held accountable for their contractual obligations, and action is taken automatically if conditions are not met. For instance, an Israeli blockchain startup provides a blockchain application for retailers to improve overall efficiency in maintaining customer records such as warranty, insurance papers, and receipts. Customers can easily access information about their purchases and earn loyalty or reward points thanks to the information stored on the blockchain digital ledger.\n\nCustomers receive immediate assistance in the event of a product malfunction, without any service delays. Furthermore, blockchain allows retailers to access and accept cryptocurrencies rather than purchasing items through a payment processing system. It facilitates secure and authenticated online transfers. When compared to credit card payments, the blockchain payment process is less expensive.\n\nNorth America is expected to have the largest market share in the Blockchain market . Early Blockchain adoption, as well as the presence of several companies offering security and Blockchain solutions, are expected to drive market growth in the region. Companies in this region are increasingly implementing security and application security solutions to enable data security, prevent cyber-attacks and commercial espionage, and ensure data security and privacy for business continuity.\n\nAccording to TripleA, a cryptocurrency solution provider, more than 300 million people worldwide will use or own cryptocurrency in 2021. The growing demand for blockchain in the government sector is driving market growth, owing to benefits such as the protection of sensitive data, lower costs, and improved efficiency. Various government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the United States, are requesting blockchain-based applications to improve data security.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is funding start-ups to conduct research and development to investigate new approaches to cyber security using blockchain technology. Over the forecast period, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a positive impact on market growth. Growing online sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to drive demand for blockchain technology among e-commerce firms. This technology is used by e-commerce companies to manage their supply chains.\n\nThe report published by SkyQuest Technology Consulting provides in-depth qualitative insights, historical data, and verifiable projections about market size.

The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter\'s closing stock price on April 1.\n\nDespite initially declining Musk’s offer and enacting anti-takeover measures, the board ultimately decided to accept Musk\'s offer once it saw confirmed funding for the acquisition.\n\nIn a company statement, Bret Taylor, Twitter\'s independent board chair, said: "The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\'s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter\'s stockholders.”\n\nApril 11: Kaseya buys Datto for $6.2B and takes the company private\n\nSecurity software company Kaseya has agreed to buy Datto for $6.2 billion and will take the company private again, after it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2020. Datto was founded in 2007 and provides data backup and security software, primarily to managed service providers.\n\n“This is exciting news for Kaseya’s global customers, who can expect to see more functional, innovative and integrated solutions as a result of the purchase,” said Fred Voccola, Kaseya’s CEO.\n\nApril 5: AMD acquires Pensando for $1.9B\n\nChipmaker AMD has announced the acquisition of Pensando for approximately $1.9 billion.\n\nPensado specializes in data processing unites (DPUs), which include intelligent, programmable software to support the software-defined cloud, compute, networking, storage, and security services that could be rolled out quickly to edge, colocation, or service-provider networks.\n\n“There are a wide range of use cases—such as 5G and IoT—that need to support lots of low-latency traffic,” Soni Jiandani, Pensando cofounder and chief business office told Network World last November. “We’ve taken a ground-up approach to giving enterprise customers a fully programmable system with the ability to support multiple infrastructure services without dedicated CPUs.”\n\nMarch 29: Celonis acquires Process Analytics Factory\n\nProcess mining specialist Celonis is acquiring fellow German software firm, Process Analytics Factory, for a reported $100 million.\n\nUp until now, Celonis has been focused on helping enterprises optimize processes around their ERP systems — and more recently has branched out to help them optimize their use of workflow automation platforms, too. Now it is acquiring Process Analytics Factory to improve its process mining offering and help enterprises automate with Microsoft’s Power Platform.\n\nIn October 2020 Celonis launched its Execution Management System (EMS) to visualize and design more efficient processes, and in April 2021 it formed a partnership with Microsoft to deliver process analytics through Power BI and to integrate its process improvement tools with Microsoft power Platform. Then, in October 2021, it partnered with ServiceNow to deliver process mining capabilities to the Now platform. It also has technology partnerships with Appian, Coupa, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce, Snowflake, Splunk, and a handful of other software vendors.\n\nMarch 28: HP to acquire Poly for $3.3B\n\nHP has announced it is acquiring Poly, a company that specializes in video and audio equipment, for a purchase price of $1.7 billion, with a total transaction value of $3.3 billion, including debt. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2022.\n\nThe acquisition is set to accelerate HP’s foray into the world of hybrid work, coming eight months after the company purchased remote desktop software provider Teradici.\n\nFounded in 1990 and originally named Polycom, the company was acquired by headset maker Plantronics in 2019, after which the two newly merged companies rebranded themselves as Poly. Since then, the company has focused on providing enterprise-grade collaboration products, such as meeting room speakers and cameras, webcams, headsets, and software.\n\n“The rise of the hybrid office creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the way work gets done,” said Enrique Lores, president and CEO of HP. “Combining HP and Poly creates a leading portfolio of hybrid work solutions across large and growing markets. Poly’s strong technology, complementary go-to-market, and talented team will help to drive long-term profitable growth as we continue building a stronger HP.”\n\nMarch 23: Apple acquires UK fintech startup Credit Kudos\n\nApple is acquiring the UK-based fintech startup Credit Kudos for an undisclosed amount. Credit Kudos last raised £5 million ($6.5 million) in funding in April 2020.\n\nNeither Credit Kudos or Apple could be reached to confirm the deal, which was first reported by the crypto-focused publication The Block, citing three sources close to the deal.\n\nCredit Kudos is a challenger credit bureau that uses machine learning and real-time data to build up a fuller picture of a person’s credit score, rather than traditional agencies, which typically rely on older information such as bank and utility statements to build a profile.\n\nThe firm has also benefitted from the recent wave of open banking regulations across the globe, which aim to open up consumer financial data via a set of secure application programming interfaces (APIs). Credit Kudos provides this data to clients for services such as affordability and risk assessments.\n\nIt is unclear what Apple plans to do with Credit Kudos, but the company has invested significantly in its fintech capabilities over recent years — in particular, its mobile Apple Pay wallet and its Apple Card credit card, which is currently only available in the US and was built in partnership with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMarch 8: Google buys cybersecurity company Mandiant\n\nGoogle will acquire cyberdefense and response firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion, in a move to offer an end-to-end security operations suite and advisory services from its cloud platform.\n\n“Cybersecurity is a mission, and we believe it’s one of the most important of our generation,” Mandiant CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement announcing the acquisition. "Google Cloud shares our mission-driven culture to bring security to every organization. Together, we will deliver our expertise and intelligence at scale via the Mandiant Advantage SaaS platform, as part of the Google Cloud security portfolio.”\n\nMarch 3: Snowflake buys Streamlit for $800M\n\nData cloud company Snowflake has acquired Streamlit for $800 million, enabling developers and data scientists to build apps using tools with simplified data access and governance.\n\nStreamlit’s open-source framework allows developers and data scientists to build and share data apps quickly and iteratively, without the need to be an expert in front-end development. According to Streamlit, the platform has had more than 8 million downloads and more than 1.5 million applications have been built using it.\n\n“At Snowflake, we believe in bringing together open standards and open source with industry-leading data governance and security,” Snowflake Co-Founder and President of Products Benoit Dageville said in a statement announcing the acquisition. “When Snowflake and Streamlit come together, we will be able to provide developers and data scientists with a single, powerful hub to discover and collaborate with data they can trust to build next generation data apps and shape the future of data science.”\n\nFeb. 28: Rakuten Symphony acquires Kubernetes platform Robin.io\n\nThe recently launched telco-focused arm of Japan’s Rakuten Group, Rakuten Symphony, has acquired Robin.io, a startup offering a Kubernetes platform optimized for storage and complex network applications.\n\nThe two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition. Since first launching, Robin.io has moved beyond its original focus on storage to offer a more full-featured Kubernetes platform, providing large telcos with ways of automating 5G services applications on Kubernetes and orchestrating private 5G and LTE deployments.\n\n“Robin.io’s technology innovations over the last several years will now get a much bigger canvas to lead the vision for cloud-native transformation for the industry. Our vision to deliver simple to use, easy to deploy hyperscale automation is very well aligned,” said Robin.io CEO Partha Seetala.\n\nFeb. 24: Cloudflare acquires security startup Area 1 Security\n\nCloudflare announced plans to acquire Area 1 Security for around $126 million, using both cash and stock to fund the acquisition.\n\nCloudflare has its own suite of zero-trust security products designed to prevent data loss, malware and phishing attacks, even when employees aren’t using their office network or a VPN. This deal will see the company add email security to this portfolio.\n\nArea 1 Security has developed a product that stops phishing attacks sent via email before they reach an inbox. The company claims to have blocked more than 40 million phishing attempts in 2021 alone.\n\nCloudflare cCo-founder and CEO Matthew Prince said in a statement: “To us, the future of Zero Trust includes an integrated, one-click approach to securing all of an organization’s applications, including its most ubiquitous cloud application, email. Together, we expect we’ll be delivering the fastest, most effective, and most reliable email security on the market.”\n\nFeb. 15: Intel to acquire Tower Semiconductor\n\nIntel announced plans to acquire Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 billion, giving it access to more specialized production as it looks to take advantage of growing demand for semiconductors. The deal has been approved by both company boards, but is expected to take as long as 12 months to move through the normal regulatory channels.\n\nIntel announced last year that it was planning to enter the foundry market to produce chips designed by their customers. Tower has been investing in multiple locations in recent years to boost capacity for 200- and 300-millimeter chips. It serves "fabless" companies, who design chips but outsource manufacturing, and integrated device manufacturers.\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger sees the move as a good fit for the company’s vision. “Tower’s specialty technology portfolio, geographic reach, deep customer relationships and services-first operations will help scale Intel’s foundry services and advance our goal of becoming a major provider of foundry capacity globally,” he said in a statement.\n\nFeb. 15: Akamai acquires Linode for $900M\n\nAkamai has entered into an agreement to acquire Linode, an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform provider, for approximately $900 million. Akamai reportedly expects Linode to add about $100 million in revenue for FY22.\n\nFounded in 2003, Linode has positioned itself as an IaaS alternative to public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Unlike many of its competitors, Linode says it had not raised outside funding, boasting it “has successfully run a profitable business since [its] inception.”\n\n“The opportunity to combine Linode’s developer-friendly cloud computing capabilities with Akamai’s market-leading edge platform and security services is transformational for Akamai,” Akamai CEO and co-founder Tom Leighton said in a statement. “Akamai has been a pioneer in the edge computing business for over 20 years, and today we are excited to begin a new chapter in our evolution by creating a unique cloud platform to build, run and secure applications from the cloud to the edge.”\n\nJan 31: Citrix to be acquired by private equity firms for $16.5B\n\nCloud computing and virtualization company Citrix is being acquired by private equity firms Vista Equity Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital for $16.5 billion. It’s been reported that Vista plans to combine Citrix with Tibco, which it acquired in 2014 for $4.3 billion.\n\nThe all-cash deal will see the publicly traded Citrix go private and will include the assumption of Citrix’s debt, the companies said.', 'image': 'https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/01/big-data_merger-and-acquisition_big-business_smb-100747394-large.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85,70', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:00'}

Unfortunately, the Medic Agent itself can cause problems by having high RAM, high CPU, and high disk usage. Luckily, the WaaS MedicAgent can be disabled completely.\n\nWhat Is WaaSMedicAgent.exe?\n\nNo software is perfect — things go wrong, and files break, including Windows Updates (especially Windows Updates). Windows as a Service Medic Agent (WaaSMedicAgent) was introduced in Windows 10 to “Enable remediation and protection of Windows Update components.” In other words, it fixes problems with Windows Update that might prevent your PC from updating.\n\nThis process is supposed to run when Windows encounters a problem with an update. Unfortunately, the Medic Agent itself has been known to cause problems. In some cases, it bogs down PCs for hours by maxing out CPUs, causing extremely high RAM usage, and causing high disk usage.\n\nIs It Malware?\n\nWaaSMedicAgent.exe is a legitimate part of Windows 10 and Windows 11. It has occasionally caused problems that resemble malicious behavior, but it isn’t malware. Of course, it is relatively common for malware authors to try to disguise malware as legitimate applications and services. You can run a scan with Microsoft Defender and Malwarebytes’ Antivirus to rule out the possibility.\n\nHow to Disable WaaSMedicAgent\n\nThough it can be annoying, you should seriously consider whether or not you want to stop the executable from running and disable the service. Windows Update will still function even if Medic Agent is disabled, but it might not be able to recover from an error if one occurs during an update.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat said, if you want to disable WaaSMedicAgent, here are a few ways you can do it.\n\nDelay Your Updates\n\nWaaSMedicAgent should only be activated if Windows Update encounters an issue. Pausing Windows 10 or Windows 11 updates can temporarily stop WaaSMedicAgent from using excessive amounts of RAM, maxing out your disk usage, utilizing your CPU, and otherwise bogging down your PC. It won’t permanently solve any of your problems, though.\n\nIf you just need to get your system working for a bit pausing updates is a good option. Just remember to let it run later so it can try to fix whatever error occurred.\n\nDisable WaaSMedicAgent Using RegEdit\n\nWaaSMedicAgent is the Windows Service that is associated with WaaSMedicAgent.exe — if you want to stop the executable from running, you need to disable the service as well. Windows will not allow you to disable the service from the Services app, but you can disable it using the Registry Editor (RegEdit). As always, be careful editing the Windows Registry. Deleting a key accidentally — or even changing a value — can cause serious problems for computers, and major headaches for humans.\n\nRELATED: Learning to Use the Registry Editor Like a Pro\n\nFirst, you need to launch RegEdit. Click the Start button, type “regedit” into the search bar, and then hit Enter or click “Open.”\n\nNavigate to the following path in the Registry Editor window, or copy-paste the following line into its address bar and press Enter:\n\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WaaSMedicSvc\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWaaSMedicService is the name of the registry key. You’ll see it in the left pane. Registry keys are a bit like folders. They can contain subkeys, which are like subfolders, and properties, which are like files.\n\nEvery registry key found within “Services” will have a property named “Start” that determines when or why the service will be launched.\n\nStart can take a few different values:\n\n2 is “Automatic”\n\n3 is “Manual”\n\n4 is “Disabled”\n\nDouble-click the “Start” property in the right pane and change the value to 4, and then click “Ok.”\n\nTip: If you’ve used the Services app before, you might have noticed that some services are Automatic, but are specifically designed to start “Delayed.” The property that sets “Delayed” is named “DelayedAutoStart”. A value of 1 enables delayed automatic start, while 0 disables delayed automatic start.\n\nDisable Using Our Registry Keys\n\nIf you don’t want to mess with the registry yourself, there are two registry keys attached to this article. One is named “Disable_WaaSMedicSvc.reg” and will disable WaasMedicSvc (and WaaSMedicAgent.exe) completely. The other REG file is named “ReEnabled_WaaSMedicSvc.reg” and will return the service to its default value.\n\nWaaSMedic_Registry_Keys\n\nJust download the zip file, extract the contents anywhere, and double-click “Disable_WaaSMedicSvc.reg.” You’ll receive a warning about the dangers of applying registry keys — hit “Yes.”\n\nKeep in mind that other components of Windows Update will probably re-enable the Medic Service at some point in time in the future. If you haven’t fixed the issue with Windows Update, you might suddenly find the service set to manual and WaaSMedicAgent.exe running unexpectedly. You can always just kick the can down the road and disable the service again, but you shouldn’t. If you have the time, let the Medic Agent run, or try to fix Windows Update manually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe registry key we provided might be helpful if you need to disable WaaSMedicSvc repeatedly since you only need to double-click it to set the service to “Disabled” again.', 'image': 'https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-11-and-10.png?height=200p&trim=2,2,2,2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:59'}

Meal kit services will send all the ingredients for any given recipe, usually premeasured and sometimes even prepped: as in chopped, minced or with certain dry ingredients already mixed together and ready to use. Convenient as they may be, most people consider meal kits to be a much more expensive alternative to buying groceries in a store. For certain services that's true but a crop of cheaper meal kit delivery services has significantly closed the gap. That's especially true considering the current inflation woes and rising cost of groceries.\n\nSo then, how much more expensive are meal kits versus buying the necessary groceries? I was wondering that very thing and with the cheapest meal kits clocking in at just $5 per serving, I had an inkling it would be pretty close. In calculating the grocery cost for two recipes from my favorite budget-friendly meal kit service, , it turns out just a measly buck or two separates the two mealtime approaches, and the perception of meal kits as pricey date-splurge may be more myth than reality in 2022.\n\nMeal kit vs. grocery store\n\nEveryPlate (meals for 2) EveryPlate (meals for 4) Groceries bought at the store Cost per serving $7.39 $6.50 $5.26\n\nSo how did I get these numbers?\n\nTo calculate the cost of meal kits when compared to buying the groceries, I took two EveryPlate recipes and priced out the ingredients. To keep things consistent I used the cheapest results that populated on , a popular online grocery delivery service here in the Northeast.\n\nSince spices are generally sold in 1- or 2-ounce bottles, I divided the cost by 20 since each bottle of spices contains roughly 20 servings. The same goes for ingredients like sour cream and soy sauce that are also sold in larger quantities. I divided the total cost by roughly how much you'd need to execute each recipe.\n\nRead more: Best Cheap Meal Delivery Services in 2022\n\nHow much does a meal kit service like EveryPlate cost?\n\nEveryPlate is one of the cheapest meal kit services, with clocking in at $5 a serving. For a meal plan for two people and three meals per week, it's slightly more at $5.89 a serving. I used the to compare with the cost of buying your own groceries. There's also a $9 flat shipping cost which I divided by the three meals. When it's all said and done, EveryPlate will cost you $7.39 a serving.\n\nEveryPlate\n\nHow much meal kits would cost if you bought the groceries\n\nBelow is a breakdown of what two would cost if you bought the groceries yourself. These prices were calculated from in early April of 2022. I didn't include the delivery fees for a grocery service or the cost of gas required to get yourself to and from the store. It's also worth noting that the grocery prices listed below are significantly lower than what I find at my local markets in Brooklyn.\n\nSmothered pork chops with home fries and carrots (2 servings)\n\nCarrots (12 ounces): $1.50\n\nFive Yukon gold potatoes: $1.50\n\nOne yellow onion: $0.90\n\n\n\nTwo scallions: $0.50\n\n\n\nTwo 5-ounce pork chops: $4.93\n\n\n\nOne packet of chicken stock concentrate: $0.60\n\n\n\nCayenne pepper: $0.20\n\n\n\nSour cream (2 ounces): $1.50\n\n\n\nTotal: $11.13\n\nCost per serving: $5.56\n\nEveryPlate\n\nCherry meatballs with zucchini and garlic mashed potatoes (2 servings)\n\nFive Yukon gold potatoes: $1.60\n\nWhite bread (one slice): $0.50\n\nOne zucchini: $1.50\n\nGround beef (8 ounces): $3.50\n\nCherry jam (1 ounce): $0.85\n\nGarlic powder: $0.10\n\nSour cream (2 ounces): $1.50\n\nSoy sauce (1 ounce): $0.50\n\nTotal: $10.05\n\nCost per serving: $5.02\n\nDavid Watsky/CNET\n\nHow much more is a meal kit than buying groceries?\n\nWhen compared to the cost of buying all the necessary groceries at the store, EveryPlate clocks in at around $2 more per serving. If you were to pick one of the plans with servings for four, it would be more like $1 more. So, it's pretty much a wash.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's convenience you're paying a little extra for. But if you choose a budget-friendly service such as EveryPlate or Dinnerly, that little extra turns out to be barely anything at all.\n\nRead more: EveryPlate Review: See How the Cheapest Meal Kit Service Holds Up in a Test\n\nWhat about the environmental cost, packaging and waste?\n\nThere's no doubt that meal kit services use more plastic than if you buy your own groceries. That said, the cheaper services have found ways to cut costs. In many cases, that means using less packaging.\n\nShelby Brown/CNET\n\nEveryPlate, for instance, is one of the most eco-friendly services I've tried. The company puts all its produce and other ingredients in a single cardboard box, whereas others individually package each ingredient, creating more waste. Most of the packaging, including the cooler box and ice packs are curbside recyclable.\n\nOn the flip side, since meal kits generally give you exactly what you need for each meal and no more, you're less likely to have food waste. Who hasn't thrown out those last few ounces from a tub of sour cream or a couple of scallions you couldn't find a use for before they wilted away?\n\nWhat about other meal kit services?\n\nEveryPlate is the cheapest meal kit service, along with The most expensive outfits -- Sunbasket, Green Chef, Martha Stewart and Marley Spoon and Blue Apron -- cost closer to $10 or $13 a serving. The added cost is generally due to premium ingredients like grass-fed beef and organic produce. With those, you're going to find a bigger delta between the meal kit cost and what it would cost to make the meal at home. Services like HelloFresh and Home Chef fall somewhere in the middle with meal kits ranging from around $8 and $10 a serving.\n\nNot interested in cooking at all?

Some services see it as a chance to encourage upgrades or just as free advertising for the paid service. Others, however, host third-party ads, which means you may be targeted based on your browsing habits—potentially killing the point of using a VPN in the first place—while others might be analyzing the websites you visit in the name of optimization or big data collection.\n\nIf you plan on using a VPN long term it’s a good idea to pay for the privilege. That way you get more server locations, more simultaneous device connections, and sometimes even better speeds. Restrictions on free services vary by service provider, but there are always restrictions of some kind.\n\nNevertheless, free VPNs are good if you just want to try out a service for a while, or if you only need a VPN every now and then. If you’re looking for a VPN for Windows here are our top recommendations.\n\nIf and when you decide to upgrade to full-fledged paid service, check out our comprehensive roundup of the best VPN services—our recommendations vary from this list once money is on the line.\n\n1. ProtonVPN – Best overall Best Prices Today: When it comes to Windows and free VPNs you can’t beat ProtonVPN. The free version only allows one device connection at a time per account, but that’s all you need if Windows is your focus. ProtonVPN’s speeds are second best in our tests of the paid services, but ProtonVPN does limit free account speeds somewhat to what it calls “Medium speed.” These speeds were entirely acceptable, however, for all the various things you might want to do such as video streaming or regular web browsing. Note, however, that explicit Netflix support is not part of the free offering. We also like ProtonVPN’s app design, which can be expanded to a larger version with an interactive map. Alternatively, it can be reduced to something more like a smartphone app. ProtonVPN requires an email address and password to use the free version and users are limited to three country choices. Read our full ProtonVPN review 2. Windscribe – Best for multiple devices Windscribe is the value choice if you want a lot of extra features and fewer limitations than other free services with one big exception. Namely, that you only get 10GB worth of data per month. That is not enough for a lot of video streaming, but it’s fine for everything else. As a trade-off there are no device limits and you get 10 location choices, which is more than most free services. The Windscribe app is also pretty straightforward Windscribe requires you to sign up with an email address. Read our full Windscribe Pro review 3. Hide.me – Also recommended Best Prices Today: Hide.me is a mix of both ProtonVPN and Windscribe. Similar to Windscribe you only get 10GB per month with the free version, and like ProtonVPN you only get one device at a time. Country choices are narrowed down to four with two regions in the U.S. for a total of five location options. Read our full Hide.me review\n\nWhat to look for in a free VPN on Windows\n\nWhen you’re shopping for a free service for Windows the criteria are similar to what you’d consider for a general free VPN. You want a service that is not displaying third-party ads or harvesting your browsing habits. Privacy is key with VPNs and even on a free one there’s no reason to compromise.\n\nNext, you can consider what’s important to you such as ease of use with an interface you understand, speeds, and country choices. That last point is going to be fairly restricted when going free, because that’s standard practice for free VPNs. Nevertheless, if you want a U.S. connection, for example, most free services will offer that.\n\nIf you’re hoping to use Netflix overseas with a free VPN you may be out of luck. Sometimes it might work on a regular U.S. server, but for the most part Netflix streaming requires specialty servers provided as part of a premium package. Other streaming services, however, may not be as picky as Netflix is when it comes to detecting VPN connections.\n\nHow we test VPNs\n\nAll VPNs tested on Windows go through a three-day process. Each day we test the VPN speeds in five different countries plus the base speed without a VPN connection. Each country is tested three times per day taking the average.\n\nWhen the testing is done we take the average of the base speed, and the overall global average of the VPN speeds. Then we represent the drop from the base speed as a percentage. The idea is to show how generally good a VPN is across all locations, and not just Europe or the United States. We also don’t show specific megabytes-per-second speed since those speeds can vary greatly, but how much dip to expect as a percentage can be more generalized.\n\nFree VPNs can sometimes hamper the speeds compared to what you see on free VPNs; however, that’s not as much of a concern here as all the VPNs we recommend have good speeds regardless.\n\nFinding a good free VPN for Windows is fairly simple. It all depends on whether you prioritize features like unlimited data usage, extra features, or a higher number of country options.', 'image': 'https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/free-gettyimages-1056445318-100825073-orig-100915024-orig-1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:12'}

The network focuses on e-commerce businesses via a suite of proprietary features and products. The goal of the project is to make it easy for businesses to seamlessly accept cryptocurrency payments. To this extent, Utrust continues to deliver with more businesses joining the protocol weekly.\n\nWhat Problems Does Utrust (UTK) Solve?\n\nOne of the primary issues that Utrust seeks to solve is slow business adoption. Cryptocurrencies are faster, more efficient, and secure than fiat currency, yet many businesses don’t accept these digital assets due to volatility concerns. There are businesses that want to accept cryptocurrencies, but don’t know where to begin to make the process a reality. Utrust was built to provide these users with full support.\n\nThe protocol helps to alleviate merchant concerns through its easy-to-navigate dashboard. New users can find all the features they need to start accepting crypto payments today. The system was built from the ground up to mitigate volatility and improve returns for merchants.\n\nConversion delays\n\nPart of this strategy includes reducing conversion delays. The crypto market is volatile with price changes happening every minute. As such, it’s vital for a merchant processor to complete transactions in near real-time to ensure no loss in value from the point of sale to the finalization of the transactions. Utrust provides immediate conversion from crypto to fiat currency to ensure there is no loss in value incurred by merchants.\n\nLack of Consumer Protection\n\nAnother major problem in the crypto merchant sector is a lack of consumer protections. Cryptocurrencies bring some advantages, but there are some caveats, such as the inability to refund on public blockchains. Utrust introduces a variety of buyer protections to improve the scenario.\n\nUtrust focuses on securing transactions between buyers and sellers. Specifically, buyers and sellers enjoy more flexibility such as the ability to communicate prior to the transaction to improve verification. This approach streamlines the exchange between both parties and improves the overall user experience.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation is another concern that has made headlines recently. Inflation occurs when a currency losses buying power. It’s one of the worst things that can happen to savers because it steals their wealth. Utrust integrates deflationary protocols to prevent inflation from causing issues to users.\n\nSpecifically, a small percentage of the fees are converted into UTK and burned. Burning tokens refer to removing them from circulation forever. To accomplish this task, the developers will send the tokens to an address that has no withdrawal option. The goal of this process is to reduce the overall supply. In turn, this drives up the demand which results in higher token values.\n\nBenefits of Utrust (UTK)\n\nThere are a lot of benefits that Utrust users gain. For one, the payment processing services were designed to provide seamless integration into current PoS systems. This easy onboarding benefits consumers and merchants as the protocol requires no previous experience to manage. Best of all, merchants receive their payments in fiat currency.\n\nDashboard\n\nThe Utrust interface is where users access all of the features of the network. The developer went to great lengths to ensure the dashboard was efficient and easy to navigate.\n\nLow Fees\n\nThose seeking an affordable alternative to PayPal and other centralized online payment processors should consider Utrust. The network has low conversion fees and there is no exchange rate fee when conducting transactions in the network’s native utility token, UTK. The network charges a small 1% commission and conversion fee for normal transactions.\n\nFlexibility\n\nAnother reason why Utrust has become so popular is its flexibility. The network supports different digital currencies and fiat currencies. As such, it operates as a low-cost solution for any business seeking a flexible international online payments processor.\n\nHow Does Utrust (UTK) Work\n\nUtrust works through a combination of systems. The network makes it easy to accept digital currencies. It combines the most popular features found on traditional payment gateways with the security of blockchain technology. This structure enables the protocol to conduct real-time business-to-consumer transactions.\n\nWhen a transaction is sent, the network automatically converts the cryptocurrency into fiat currencies in real-time. This process is completely autonomous and the network seeks out the lowest conversion rate as part of the process. Notably, there is a holding period in place for new merchants to prevent fraud. As your reputation builds and you conduct more transactions, the holding period gets waived.\n\nUtrust wallet\n\nThe Utrust wallet makes it simple to conduct crypto transactions. This versatile digital wallet can store a variety of popular ERC-20 tokens and popular cryptocurrencies. The protocol was built to operate on your favorite mobile device. Anyone can store their UTK tokens and buy products using this wallet.\n\nToken\n\nThe UTK token is an essential component of the Utrust network. It’s the main utility token for the Utrust system. Users save when they conduct transactions using this token. They can also send UTK across the globe in seconds using the peer-to-peer network. Notably, UTK is an ERC-20 standard token that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, it enjoys a high level of interoperability in the market.\n\nHistory\n\nUtrust entered the market in October 2017 during the crypto breakout. The network was founded by Artur Goulao, Filipe Castro, Nuno Correia, and Roberto Machado. It currently lists Sanja Kon as CEO. Kon has an expansive history of working as the Head of Marketplaces and Large Enterprises at PayPal. Today, Utrust is a top-performing crypto payment processor in the market.\n\nHow to Buy UTRUST (UTK)\n\nCurrently, UTRUST (UTK) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nBinance – Best for Australia, Canada, Singapore, UK and most of the world. USA residents are prohibited from buying UTRUST (UTK). Use Discount Code: EE59L0QP for 10% cashback off all trading fees.\n\nKuCoin – This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. This exchange currently accepts International & United States residents.\n\nGate.io – This exchange was established in 2013, and is one of the more popular & reputable exchanges. Gate.io currently accepts most international jurisdictions including Australia & the UK. USA & Canada residents are prohibited.\n\nHuobi Global – Established in 2013, Huobi Global has since become one of the world’s largest digital asset exchanges, with an accumulated trading volume of US $1 trillion. It should be noted that Huobi Global currently does not accept USA or Canadian residents.\n\nUtrust – Bridging the Gap\n\nThe Utrust strategy is to help bring more businesses into the crypto sphere. This makes sense as they have the most to gain from such a venture. Additionally, this step is essential to drive large-scale crypto adoption in the future. For these reasons, you can expect to see Utrust continue to expand its network of merchants and users over the coming months.', 'image': 'https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/KqGSM2A.h-iG~1d34f/w:1000/h:600/q:mauto/rt:fill/g:ce/https://www.securities.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/UTRUST.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:27'}

If you want to read about some more crypto firms, go directly to 5 Biggest Crypto Companies in the World.\n\nCryptocurrencies have witnessed increased institutional investor interest in recent months as inflation climbs and the appeal of popular coins as a safe haven and wealth storage device soars in a volatile marketplace. Chainalysis, a crypto information firm, revealed in a report on April 20 that crypto investors around the globe had realized total gains of $162.7 billion in 2021, up from just $35.5 billion in the previous year. The United States led other countries in these gains with over $47 billion, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan.\n\nOne of the interesting things highlighted in the report, and perhaps a stark reminder of the capabilities of the revolutionary blockchain technology, was that countries that do not rank high on traditional measures of economic prosperity, like the gross domestic product (GDP), usually outperform in the crypto space. For example, Turkey, which ranks 11th in the world in terms of GDP, is sixth in realized cryptocurrency gains at $4.6 billion. Ukraine, a symbol against Russian aggression, is 40th in GDP but 13th in realized cryptocurrency gains at $2.8 billion.\n\nThe report also discussed in detail the cryptocurrency developments in China, one of the largest crypto markets in the world. In 2021, the total estimated realized cryptocurrency gains for China were $5.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in 2020. Although this represented an annual growth rate of an impressive 194%, despite a regulatory crackdown against blockchain tech in China, it was far lower than growth rates of other crypto countries like the US, at 476%, and the UK, at 431%, and Germany, at 423%.\n\nEmerging Trends: Ethereum Edges Bitcoin, NFTs Explode\n\nAnother emerging theme within the crypto industry, which is gaining mainstream recognition through efforts of firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), is the performance of Ethereum, the second most-popular coin, against Bitcoin. Per Chainalysis, the total realized gains globally for Ethereum were $76.3 billion, compared to $74.7 billion for Bitcoin. Several experts had previously forecast that Ethereum was a better long-term investment than Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Tally Greenberg, the head of business development at crypto firm Allnodes, is of the opinion that “the technological advantage and utility of Ethereum blockchain is far greater than that of Bitcoin”. Megan Kaspar, the managing director of asset management firm Magnetic, has forecast that there will be an institutional investor shift towards Ethereum as the importance of new updates to the Ethereum network, which include a shift towards a more environmentally-friendly mining option, become more apparent.\n\nWithin the crypto sector, the non-fungible tokens marketplace is also exploding. NFTs are just one way in which blockchain technology can reshape the world around us. An NFT is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. Some examples include digital forms of photos, videos, and audio. A report by Nonfungible recently outlined that trading in NFTs climbed close to $18 billion last year, an increase of 21,000% from 2020.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe companies that operate in the crypto sector were selected for the list through a careful assessment of business fundamentals to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The growth catalysts for these firms are also discussed to paint a more holistic picture.\n\nBiggest Crypto Companies in the World\n\n10. Chainalysis\n\nChainalysis is a software firm that provides blockchain data and analysis to governments, banks, and businesses across the globe. One of the premier products of the company is compliance, regulatory, and investigative software related to blockchain technology. This software can detect and prevent various illegal activities like money laundering. This is a key competitive edge for the firm as hacks and related privacy concerns around blockchain tech are clouding the future development for the sector.\n\nOne statistics that highlights this competitive edge is the number of customers that Chainalysis serves. Nearly 650 organizations that include crypto exchanges, leading banks, payment processors, hedge funds and venture capital firms, use Chainalysis software. The firm recently launched Cross-Chain Investigations to Reactor, a tool that helps customers trace cryptocurrencies and related digital assets across blockchains. In June last year, the company had raised over $100 million at a Series C funding round at a valuation of over $4 billion.\n\nJust like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), Chainalysis is one of the crypto firms that elite investors are flocking to as the risk/reward profile of the growth sector improves.\n\n9. Uniswap\n\nUniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange that embraces the transparency at the center of the blockchain revolution. The exchange is used on blockchain networks that run open-source software. This is in contrast to other crypto exchanges that are run on centralized servers. A growing number of developers, traders, and liquidity providers are using the functionalities of the platform. Per the company, it has so far generated over $935 billion in trading volume and more than 95 million trades. The platform had more than three million users at the end of 2021.\n\nUniswap has the highest market shares among decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges at close to a quarter of all trades. It also has the highest daily trading volume in this group. On Uniswap, transactions are executed on-chain but there is no central authority that is facilitating these trades. Rather, users are free to interact with other users through a secure system and trade directly through their crypto wallets. These transactions are transparent and also open-source, decreasing the likelihood of money laundering.\n\n8. Kraken\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange and bank. It is based in California and was founded in 2011. The exchange already operates in more than 60 countries across the world. It was recently granted a license to start operations in the UAE as well. The Middle East is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets. Chainalysis estimates that nearly 7% of the global crypto trades originate from the region. Kraken is the first firm to offer direct trades of UAE dirhams against Bitcoin. The UAE trades about $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency each year.\n\nKraken is the fourth largest exchange in the world in terms of trading volume. More than six million users are on the platform for crypto trading. These users are spread across 190 countries. Jesse Powell, the CEO of the firm, has previously said that the exchange could go public in late 2022. The company is valued at close to $20 billion. The exchange has a daily trading volume in the hundreds of millions. In January last year, at the height of the crypto craze, the exchange did $56 billion worth of trading, more than the trading for the entire year in 2019.\n\n7. Sandbox\n\nSandbox is a metaverse platform. The platform, which initially started out as a game available for playing on computers and mobiles, operates on a play-to-earn model. The blockchain-based version of Sandbox allows users to create their own avatars, which can also be traded, to access different kinds of environments and games within the metaverse. The platform is the biggest of its kind in the crypto space and has more than 2 million users. These users can also trade in virtual real estate within the metaverse.\n\nIn 2021, the total land sales volume on Sandbox stood at over $350 million. Nearly 80% of this volume occurred in the last quarter of 2021. Secondary sales during the period were up more than 1.600% quarter-over-quarter. The number of active buyers on the platform grew in all four quarters of 2021 and increased by 37% between October and December. The median price for Sandbox land was $1,308 at the end of the third quarter but jumped to a median price of $11,364 by the end of the year.\n\n6. OpenSea\n\nOpenSea is a marketplace for non-fungible tokens. As of early 2022, the platform has more than 600,000 users. This represents a huge increase over March 2020, when the users on the platform numbered just 4,000. The monthly viewing numbers for the OpenSea website are more impressive. The site attracts over 120 million visits per month, per conservative estimates. This puts it far ahead of the competition in the NFT market sector. In 2021, the company made more than $365 million in revenue from NFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn 2020, the revenue of OpenSea was just $525,000. The difference highlights the incredible growth that NFTs have made in the crypto space. The marketplace charges 2.5% for every transaction on the platform. This is similar to what competitors like Rarible charge. The company is estimated to be worth more than $13 billion. So far, the firm has raised more than $427 million in financing over nine funding rounds. $300 million of this came at a Series C funding round in early 2022.\n\nIn addition to Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), OpenSea is one of the companies that institutional investors are monitoring.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Crypto Companies in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDisclosure.

Look no further than the industry\'s biggest names: Bitcoin (BTC -5.58%) and Ethereum (ETH -6.22%). Let\'s explore why these "blue chip" cryptos have what it takes to maintain their huge leads over rivals.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nLaunched in 2009, Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency that started it all. And despite technical weaknesses, the platform still dominates crypto with a market cap of $788 billion -- a full 41% of the total industry. Bitcoin can remain a great investment for decades to come because of its unparalleled brand recognition and maturity.\n\nBitcoin has a transaction capacity of just five per second and doesn\'t support decentralized applications (dApps) that use smart contracts to offer services on the blockchain. But this doesn\'t destroy its value proposition. Think of Bitcoin as digital gold. Gold is not the rarest metal, nor is it the most useful. But it has value because of its history and acceptance. People agree that it is valuable, so it is.\n\nBitcoins\' first-mover advantage also gives it some fundamental advantages. According to the crypto directory, Cryptwerk, almost 8,000 listed merchants accept Bitcoin as payment compared to just over 4,000 for its closest rival, Ethereum. The platform\'s age also means it\'s hugely decentralized, with the top 10 holders only controlling 5.6% of the coins in circulation. For newer platforms like Shiba Inu, the top 10 holders control 64% of the units in circulation, increasing the risk of price manipulation.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nWhile Bitcoin was the first public blockchain to hit the market, Ethereum was the first to expand the technology\'s use-cases through dApps, giving it a big advantage in attracting users and developers. While Ethereum faces an arguably tougher challenge from newer, faster rivals, its development team looks up to the job.\n\nDecentralized applications use self-executing smart contracts to offer blockchain-based services ranging from cryptocurrency exchanges to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can be used to create digital art and collectibles. Ethereum is the leader in virtually all dApp categories, hosting almost 3,000 of the roughly 4,000 total projects, according to crypto analytics site stateofthedapps.com.\n\nThat said, dApps dramatically increase transaction volume on the network, so Ethereum (which only handles 15 transactions per second) probably won\'t be able to rest on its laurels like its simpler counterpart Bitcoin. It will need to get dramatically faster to stay relevant.\n\nTo meet the growing demand, Ethereum\'s developers are working on an upgrade called The Merge, which will change the blockchain\'s current proof-of-work consensus mechanism (where miners solve computation puzzles to verify transactions) to a proof-of-stake system where miners will use their existing coins. It is unclear when this change will go live -- or how much faster it will make Ethereum. But the platform has a track record of successful updates.\n\nBlue chip cryptocurrencies?\n\nIn the stock market, blue-chip stocks are shares of well-known, well-established industry leaders. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the cryptocurrency equivalent. Their first-mover advantages, strong brands, and active development teams will help them stay relevant in the increasingly competitive blockchain opportunity.', 'image': 'https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/675938/gettyimages-1323758599.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:28'}

After DeFi’s massive explosion in popularity in 2020, major projects such as Compound and Terra have seen unprecedented adoption.\n\nDecentralized cryptocurrencies are by nature trustless and permissionless, allowing any human with an internet connection and a phone to own them. DeFi makes this possible with dApps, as users rely on smart contracts, instead of centralized organizations, to create a secure network.\n\nDeFi cryptocurrencies are used in a multitude of ways, from utility to governance. For example: PancakesSwap users who HODL $CAKE have access to yield-farming opportunities, staking and on proposals made by the community to ‘govern’ the ecosystem.\n\nTop 5 DeFi Cryptocurrencies\n\nSchnoodle is a progressive DeFi cryptocurrency. It is the world’s first truly trustless DAO with advanced bespoke technology including an automated wealth distribution system known as BARK (Blockchain Automated Reward Kickbacks), and a neoteric Moon Farming Platform. It’s like yield farming, but on the moon.\n\n$LUNA is the native token of the Terra Network, a protocol based around Decentralized stablecoins. All stablecoins on the blockchain network are convertible into LUNA, the most important of them being their own stablecoin, UST (TerraUSD), created by Terra themselves.\n\nTheir mission is to reduce stablecoin volatility inside a cryptocurrency market known for its unpredictability. Reducing volatility attracts conversative investors and in-turn grows the crypto-sphere as a whole.\n\nLUNA is also the token used to pay transaction fees on its network, vote on governance proposals and help towards the validation of the Terra network through their Delegated PoS method.\n\nLet’s not forget, LUNA is backed and co-founded by one of the biggest ‘Crypto Celebrities’, Do Kwon.\n\nPancakeSwap is one of the largest DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) by volume, hosted on the Binance Smartchain. Following in Uniswaps footsteps, PancakeSwap has steadily grown its ecosystem, taking advance of Bsc’s low fees, to integrate many use cases into the $CAKE token to ensure its HODLers stay happy.\n\nWhenever a transaction is made on PancakeSwap, a proportion of the fee charged is instantly sent back to the liquidity pool as a reward, another portion being used for $CAKE buyback to create constant positive price action for the token. If you believe in DeFi, you believe in PancakeSwap.\n\nAnother DAO token, $CRV is the native token of Curve Finance; An Automated-Market Maker providing a DEX platform with a focus on stablecoins. If you’re looking to trade assets of the same value, such as stablecoins, Curve is the place to do it.\n\nDeep liquidity pools mean you can quickly, and with minimal spread, get any stablecoin on any blockchain network. $CRV is the governance token for the Curve network, where users can lockup their CRV tokens to receive veCRV, making them eligible to vote on proposals and receive staking rewards.\n\nCurve finance service is helping create a reliable way to ‘trade’ assets across DeFi, a service which has not yet been tackled and often taken for granted in CeFi. If DeFi gains mass adoption, so will Curve.\n\nCompound is a DeFi borrowing and lending protocol, aiming to provide what traditional banks provide in a decentralized manner. Users can deposit their crypto assets as lenders and receive rewards, whilst borrowers can take from liquidity pools through ‘collateralized loans’.\n\nWith over $500 million locked in their protocols, Compound is reshaping the way we think about loans, and the centralized finance system as a whole. Their native token, $COMP, is rewarded for many activities on their network such as withdrawals and borrowing crypto assets and is based on the amount of cTokens you hold.\n\nMoreover, COMP holders get access to Compound Governance, like most DeFi projects, to push the network forward in a decentralized way.\n\nSummary\n\nIf you truly believe in the core principles of cryptocurrencies; Trustless, Permissionless and Decentralized, then you believe in DeFi and what it could provide for millions around the world, unshackling them from the burden of corrupt or disinterested centralized authority.\n\nSimilar to any emerging market, not every project will survive. However, choosing projects such as Terra or Compound which solve fundamental problems within this emerging ecosystem gives you the best chance at picking a project with potential.\n\nFinally, supporting DeFi cryptocurrencies which help facilitate decentralized, peer-to-peer trade means you are directly moving the financial world in a direction that is better for the individual, creating a trustless ecosystem built on the back of open-source smart contracts.', 'image': 'https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TIM-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:17'}

The QTM coin, which is currently available for presale, has already experienced promising increases of over 54% and is likely to impress its early investors in the coming weeks. A coin’s price cannot decline during this stage, presales provide reduced prices and the potential for higher capital growth.\n\nQuitriam Finance (QTM) is a decentralised multi-chain AMM, incubator, yield farming, and NFT launch with the unique objective of establishing an inclusive DeFi (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem powered by a faster, cheaper, and more accessible multi-chain AMM.

Users of Quitriam Finance will be able to execute peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions utilising liquidity offered by other community members. The platform’s goal is to take advantage of advanced DEX features and process transactions at a rate of 50,000 transactions per second for a cheap price of $0.00001 per transfer.\n\nQuitriam Finance intends to launch its token, which will be powered by BoostX. BoostX is known for its dynamic cryptocurrency launchpad, which is dedicated to ensuring that new ventures succeed on the market. Even though they are new to the business, BoostX has already established an amazing track record by successfully participating in multiple Initial Coin Offering (ICO) launches and presales.\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is one of the most widely used digital currencies, having been one of the first few cryptocurrencies established after Bitcoin. Litecoin seeks to deliver quick, inexpensive, and secure payment options by utilising blockchain technology. Despite its long history in the crypto market, LTC is still regarded as a sound investment.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is on a quest to bring about massive changes. It has recently joined the gaming and non-financial transaction (NFT) industries. Litecoin used OmniLite, a second-layer solution for smart contract development, to keep up with the competition. Litecoin Mimblewimble is the most recent network update. Many blockchain features will be improved, with a particular focus on boosting privacy. Scalability, fungibility, and crypto anonymity will all be supported by the system.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market, will be upgraded to ETH 2.0 in Q3 2022. It is projected to take blockchain development to the next level, despite considerable delays till 2019. Ethereum’s power consumption should be reduced as it transitions to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. Ethereum expects to perform 150,000 transactions per second once all updates have been deployed.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralised open-source blockchain architecture that serves as a foundation for a variety of cryptocurrencies.

The Optimism team revealed the news in a blog post Tuesday. The team also shared a list of criteria for airdrop eligibility, which includes items as simple as being an Optimism user to more advanced criteria such as being a DAO voter or multisig signer.\n\nThe token airdrop will be the first in a series of airdrops to be released in the coming months. While the team did not provide an exact date for the first airdrop, it took care to warn users that it is not live yet, and any attempt to convince users otherwise is a scam.\n\nThe token drop is part of a larger move to a more decentralized governance structure. The Optimism Collective, as it will be known as of today’s announcement, will feature a bicameral “house” system that divides governance roles among a Token House and a Citizens’ House. The Token House will be comprised of recipients of OP during the first airdrop; Optimism will add users to the Citizens’ House later by way of issuing “soulbound” NFTs that cannot be bought or sold. Together, the bicameral system in intended to mitigate the possible plutocratic tendencies of purely token-based governance.\n\nOptimism leverages a form of cryptographic technology called Optimistic Rollups to help Ethereum scale. By running its own network on top of the base chain, it can process transactions at a higher speed and lower cost than Ethereum mainnet while leveraging the security of the network. Optimism has a bridge that connects Ethereum mainnet to its Layer 2 network. Since launching in 2021, the network has welcomed key DeFi projects like Synthetix and Uniswap. In launching a token, Optimism will be adopting a decentralized governance model akin to many other similar DeFi projects on Ethereum.\n\nThe token announcement had been anticipated for several days, thanks mainly to an Apr. 19 Mirror post in which Optimism detailed a plan to start a new chapter “driven by community ownership and governance.” A leaked Coinbase page also appeared to list an Optimism token last week.\n\nLayer 2 Race Intensifies\n\nThe project has seen significant growth over the past few months amid increased focus on Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions. According to L2Beat data, the network holds about $662 million in total value locked, a sum that’s jumped 15% over the last week since the token rumors started to surface. Notably, although Optimism is currently benefiting from a wave of hype, it’s still lagging behind its biggest competitor, Arbitrum, another Layer 2 solution of the Optimistic Rollup variety holding $3.57 billion in total value locked—more than half the Ethereum Layer 2 market.\n\nWhile Optimism and Arbitrum are currently two of Ethereum’s biggest scaling weapons, that’s expected to change once ZK-Rollups like StarkWare’s StarkNet gain significant traction. Last week, the early Ethereum DeFi project MakerDAO outlined plans to launch on StarkNet commencing with a bridge launch this Thursday as part of its commitment to helping the Ethereum ecosystem scale (2022 is also a big year for the Ethereum protocol and its scaling roadmap, as it’s due to launch its highly anticipated “Merge” to Proof-of-Stake).\n\nWith Optimism now dropping a token, other similar Layer 2 protocols face a decision of whether to follow suit. In the world of DeFi, it’s not uncommon for projects to release a token once a competitor does to incentivize usage and help bootstrap growth. Either way, alongside the Merge, the race to build out Layer 2 is likely to become a key narrative in Ethereumland over the next few months.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, the author of this piece was eligible for Optimism’s token airdrop.

Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, processes about 14 transactions per second and charges an average fee of more than $13.\n\nEven better, Fantom (FTM) is compatible with Solidity, the programming language used to create Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts. Developers can now quickly deploy Ethereum (ETH) based software and services on the Fantom (FTM) blockchain, improving performance and lowering costs. Yearn. finance, an Ethereum (ETH) based yield aggregator, for example, joined Fantom’s (FTM) rapidly growing network of DeFi services last October. Fantom (FTM) is currently the sixth most popular DeFi ecosystem, with nearly $6 billion invested.\n\nFantom’s (FTM) value proposition — fast and cheap transactions, as well as compatibility with Solidity — makes it an excellent candidate to disrupt Ethereum (ETH) in the coming years. What does this imply for financial investors? Fantom (FTM) has a market cap of only $3 billion. This is less than 1% of Ethereum’s (ETH) $365 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, as demand for Fantom (FTM) powered software and services grows, so will demand the FTM, pushing its price higher. And, based on its current price, investors would see a 120-fold return if its market cap reached that of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN)\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN) is up-and-coming crypto created especially for the Metaverse that enables transactions to be completed quickly and cheaply by utilising the most efficient blockchain at the appropriate time.\n\nIt has enjoyed impressive early-stage success, with a return of more than 150% for investors, since its highly anticipated presale, which began in late February – and it has all the right properties to transform the crypto market.\n\nThis metaverse-based token aims to solve a major problem in the crypto industry by providing a multi-chain solution, as well as a community-driven system centred on the Metaverse-based gaming industry, NFT games, and 3D technologies.\n\nIt comes at a critical juncture in Web 3.0 history, as Facebook changed its name to Meta in October of last year to reflect its new focus, whilst many other businesses and individuals are now looking for more decentralised cryptos to invest in.\n\nThe value of FIREPIN Token (FRPN) has risen 285% since the presale started, and continues to surge, with a further 96% value increase in one week alone, as the token strives to become the leading metaverse and NFT game development crypto for those who want to sell, buy, and trade virtual goods in the metaverse.\n\nBecause the project is planning to become a DAO, holders of the FIREPIN Token (FRPN) will be able to vote on how the crypto evolves and changes over time. Long-term investors are also rewarded weekly with more FRPN, thanks to the token’s reflection process which charges a 2% tax on all transactions and distributes some of it back to holders.\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN) is expected to have a total supply of 100 billion tokens across all protocols, with 30 million tokens set aside for the presale, which will run until mid May – meaning this is the last chance for potential investors to get in on FIREPIN Token (FRPN) at its lowest ever price.\n\nVerdict\n\nWhether or not Fantom and FIREPIN Token (FRPN) surpass Ethereum (ETH) in price and popularity, they could be rewarding long-term investments.\n\nThe blockchain industry is fiercely competitive, and the crypto market is notorious for its volatility. As a result, investors might benefit from following these simple guidelines: building a diversified portfolio — a mix of stocks and cryptos is a good place to start. Also, never invest money that you could need soon.\n\nLearn more about FIREPIN Token (FRPN) here:\n\nJoin Presale: https://presale.firepin.io/register\n\nWebsite: https://firepin.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/FIREPINOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FIREPIN_io\n\nDisclaimer: The information posted in the article is for educational purposes only.

You can invest in METIS today on Gate.io!\n\nDespite being the leading blockchain for building decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum is painfully slow, gas fees are too high when the network is busy and it’s expensive to store data on Ethereum. These serious issues must be addressed for the mainstream adoption of Ethereum as a sustainable and enjoyable platform to build applications. Layer 2 solutions –– projects that are designed to increase the speed and efficiency of specific blockchains –– solve these issues to a certain extent.\n\nMetisDAO (Metis) is one of the most promising Ethereum Layer 2 solutions that aims to solve Ethereum’s six biggest challenges: simplicity, speed, storage, scalability, security and savings. This way, Metis is able to offer extremely fast transactions that take just a few seconds and cost just a few cents, while maintaining the security of Ethereum Layer 1.\n\nThe entire goal of Metis is to build out Web3 infrastructure, allowing companies to operate entirely on the blockchain without coding templates. With arguably undervalued fundamentals, strong competitive advantages and a market capitalization rank that exceeds the top 200, METIS could be an extremely lucrative crypto gem to add to your portfolio before it reaches the masses.\n\nWhat is MetisDao?\n\nMetis is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that allows for cheaper and faster transactions. It facilitates the creation of a multipurpose, easy-to-use and scalable framework for apps and businesses transitioning from Web 2.0 to Web3.\n\nMore specifically, Metis deploys Optimistic Rollups, a type of Layer 2 construction built on top of Ethereum that allows smart contracts to be executed while being secured by Ethereum. The Metis Layer 2 network assumes all transactions are valid until proven otherwise –– hence the Optimistic part of Optimistic Rollup.\n\nUnlike many other Layer 2 solutions, Metis’ primary aim is to make developing decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized autonomous companies (DACs) on its platform easy and straightforward, especially for blockchain novices. By using Metis Polis, a middleware developed by the team to manage and interact with smart contracts, Metis aims to allow developers to integrate dApps into Metis Layer 2 with no blockchain coding.\n\nMoreover, the platform has various use cases such as blockchain-based crowdfunding, decentralized finance (DeFi)-powered social media platforms, integrated decentralized exchanges (DEXs), yield farming, open-source communities, development of investing and trading business models. In fact, the Metis team and early investors created a DAC with $100 million in grants exclusively earmarked to support high potential projects in all major crypto verticals including gaming, DeFi and DAOs.\n\nWho is Behind MetisDao?\n\nOne afternoon, two women –– Elena Sinelnikova and Natalia Ameline –– met for coffee to discuss how to make blockchain more accessible to the mainstream. As one idea transformed into another, and more individuals contributed to the idea, MetisDAO was soon born.\n\nMetisDao was founded by current CEO Elena Sinelnikova in 2019, with a simple-yet-ambitious goal of making blockchain simple and accessible to everyone. The team is experienced, has deep connections and can be verified online.\n\nElena is a well-respected blockchain educator, having founded CryptoChicks in 2017 –– an education nonprofit that focuses on blockchain education for women. Among the other competent members of the Metis team is Natalia Ameline, who is also the mother of Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum’s co-founder). Buterin has openly stated that Layer 2 solutions are pivotal for improving the scalability of Ethereum, and Metis aims to be the leading project that meets this need.\n\nThe project has acquired multiple significant partnerships recently with organizations including Tristan Metaverse, PAID Network, PARSIQ and OpenDeFi.\n\nMetisDAO Price History\n\nMetisDAO has a current market capitalization of roughly $215 million, placing it in the top 300 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. With a circulating supply of roughly 3 billion and a max supply of 10 billion METIS, METIS is down significantly from all-time highs during the current 2022 bear market. Bearish and fearful market sentiment presents a potential buying opportunity for investors who believe in the fundamentals of METIS.\n\nIt is important to note that 50% of the supply of METIS is reserved for community mining. Namely, the project offers member DACs a reward in METIS for each transaction conducted on the Metis platform. Projects will be financially incentivized to contribute to the long-term success of Metis platform and the token, ultimately helping grow the thriving Metis ecosystem.\n\nMetisDAO Competition\n\nArbitrum and Optimism are Metis’ core competitors. They are both Layer 2 solutions that also deploy Optimistic Rollups. However, despite the similar Layer 2 framework, Metis’ unique mission of making blockchain more accessible is a crucial differentiating factor that separates it from all other competitors.\n\nThis competitive advantage is primarily driven by MetisDAO’s middleware, Metis Polis, an innovative tool to move dApps and DACs to Metis with zero blockchain coding knowledge. With their middleware, all an entity needs to make the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 is a viable product to deploy. Under this framework, DACs will be able to deploy their own dApps and tokens with a click of a button while users will have access to roles, permissions, HR, payroll, communications and marketing.\n\nFor end users, Polis is another web wallet. However, with a Polis account, all transaction history will be recorded and eventually turned into Reputation Power –– a feature that will benefit users when they collaborate in a DAC (benefits such as higher decision-making power and more discounts).\n\nOverall, if successful, Polis will provide a significant incentive for DACs and end users, particularly those new to the blockchain space, to use Metis over Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nIn addition to making blockchain extremely accessible, Metis differs from Optimism and Arbitrum in the following ways:\n\nAt the time of writing, Metis is the only one of these solutions that has its own native token (METIS).\n\nMetis is less vulnerable to delay attacks than Optimism.\n\nMetis is more scalable than both Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nBuilder Mining: every time a dApp performs a transaction, the dApp generates a token reward –– an ecosystem incentive many other Layer 2s don’t have.\n\nAbritrum and Optimism both support intelligent contract execution, but only Metis provides InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)-integrated decentralized storage for smart contract computing –– support of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, applications, websites and data. In other words, it allows for users to directly store and download their NFTs on the Metis network at any time, right away.\n\nFor other Optimistic Rollups, the withdrawal time from Layer 2 to Ethereum is seven days. Currently, withdrawal times are a few hours, and once Metis is fully developed, they will be cut down to a few minutes. This goal will be achieved through a network of Rangers who validate transactions and Metis Virtual Machine (MVM).\n\nMVM is a virtual machine that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which separates the computing and storage of the Ethereum construct for Layer 2s. This feature ultimately allows for shorter wait times when withdrawing to the Ethereum network.\n\nRangers are financially incentivized to auditors or validators that stake and mine METIS to verify transactions. If they process a invalid transaction, their stake will be slashed, which disincentivizes bad actors. The process is secured by Ethereum’s Layer 1.\n\nHow to Buy METIS Tokens\n\nBest For Professionals Overall Rating Read Review get started securely through Gate.io’s website More Details Best For Professionals N/A 1 Minute Review Gate.io aims to be your one-stop shop for cryptocurrency trading. The platform carries nearly 200 different currencies spread across over 350 markets. Traders can buy and sell cryptocurrency, with spot and margin trading being the most commonly used markets.

Best For Beginners and professionals hoping to trade cryptocurrency across multiple markets\n\nAnyone concerned with security\n\nTraders needing additional information for their investments\n\nConsumers looking for an expansive rewards program Pros Many cryptocurrencies from which to choose\n\nMultiple trading styles\n\nEnhanced, industry-leading security\n\nLow fees\n\nQuality mobile app Cons Almost too much functionality\n\nA busy customer support system\n\nMETIS is already listed and trading on a few major exchanges such as Gate.io and Poloniex. At the time of writing, the Gate.io exchange possesses the most liquidity. The liquidity is predominantly centered around METIS/USDT trading pair.\n\nAdditionally, you can purchase METIS tokens on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Uniswap allows trading METIS tokens with the ETH pair and has the highest volume.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Outlook\n\nWhile METIS may boast a strong value proposition compared to other cryptocurrencies, like most altcoins, METIS is heavily affected by the general trends and sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. So far into 2022, the broader cryptocurrency market has been hammered by uncertain macroeconomic conditions, resulting in bearish and fearful market sentiment.\n\nIs MetisDAO a Good Investment?\n\nIf you believe in the importance of Layer 2 solutions, Metis could be a perfect choice. Metis’ layer 2 is highly scalable, fast and low-cost compared to Ethereum’s slow and expensive Layer 1. Additionally, with Ethereum as its base Layer 1, Metis’ level of security and decentralization is equivalent to Ethereum’s and is much higher than other alternative Layer 1s such as Solana, Avalanche and Cardano. As such, Metis can be viewed as the best of both worlds.\n\nEven after The Merge, formerly ETH 2.0, Layer 2 solutions will continue to play an important role in empowering Ethereum to realize its full potential and functionality, as stated by Buterin. The potential of METIS is boundless and limited only by the effort of the team and community. If Metis continues to execute its mission while successfully dealing with the challenges inherent to Optimistic Rollups such as bridging delays and the potential for fraud, an investment into METIS could prove to be a profitable endeavor.', 'image': 'https://www.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MetisDAO.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:18'}

For more info, visit our Terms of Use page\n\nFacing a multitude of threats to systems and data, everyone from small and medium businesses to large enterprises and nonprofits are turning to cloud backup and recovery services. Combining both data backup protections and recovery capabilities, disaster recovery as a service solutions help ensure continued operations should a catastrophe, failure, accident or other adverse event occur.\n\nJump to:\n\nSEE: Hiring Kit: Database engineer (TechRepublic Premium)\n\nWhat is disaster recovery as a service?\n\nDRaaS is a cloud computing strategy in which an organization pays a provider to protect the organization’s data and information from disruption ⏤ due either to natural disasters, human error or cyberattacks ⏤ by enabling full operational recovery using a cloud-based solution.\n\nHow does DRaaS work?\n\nDRaaS works in various ways. In some cases, a disaster recovery services vendor will leverage a small appliance installed on-premises at a client’s site. These appliances collect backup images and send backup information offsite where it can later be used to recover operations at a new location. In other cases, DRaaS solutions target continuous data replication to permit spinning up disaster recovery services in the cloud or at another location.\n\nRegardless of the data backup and synchronization strategy, most DRaaS solutions offer many common capabilities, including encrypted data transfer, offsite replication, emergency recovery and maintenance.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using DRaaS?\n\nThe benefits of using DRaaS are that organizations can integrate these cloud-based services within their larger business continuity and disaster recovery plans to properly protect systems, applications and data in a way that also fulfills their specific disaster recovery requirements.\n\nProper and effective disaster planning requires addressing numerous elements, such as system, application and data backups, safe storage of those backups, and quick recovery. DRaaS providers offer a complete smorgasbord of options to organizations of all sizes operating across all industries. These providers tailor their DRaaS solutions to an organization’s specific needs.\n\nA small advertising firm may survive if recovery operations take several days. However, a large accounting firm might need to return to regular operation in just an hour were a disaster to occur during the height of tax season.\n\nTop DRaaS providers and solutions\n\nAcronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect\n\nAcronis offers a variety of cloud-based data protection and recovery solutions. While some Acronis products, such as Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud, are designed for managed services providers to wield assisting customers, still others are built specifically for businesses and organizations.\n\nPaired together, two Acronis products provide organizations with a powerful one-two punch. Known as Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect, this DRaaS solution creates a powerful combination to both protect data and applications and enable disaster recovery.\n\nThe primary product, Acronis Cyber Protect, gives businesses potent backup and recovery software that also includes integrated cybersecurity features. Its single console simplifies managing data and endpoint protection, reducing administration overhead while identifying and resolving issues. Starting at $79 for small- and medium-size environments, the software permits making image, file and local backups. The platform permits bare metal recovery and the recovery of production systems to dissimilar hardware. It is compatible within Windows, Linux, VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V environments.\n\nAdding another Acronis solution, Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery, boosts effectiveness. The service adds a streamlined disaster recovery process in which testing failover and failback of protected data, applications and systems is both enabled and simplified.\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery add-on also enables other critical capabilities. Using the add-on, administrators can customize recovery point objectives that help ensure the most current data is recovered. In the event of a disaster, the add-on also permits recovering and running an organization’s operations directly from Acronis’ cloud server environment. Such potentialities prove critical in the event of floods, fires, tornados and other disasters.\n\nPricing depends upon a number of variables, including the number of protected machines and the amount of data being stored. Firms can test the solution for free for 30 days.\n\nContact Acronis directly at 1-781-782-9000 for more information or with questions.\n\nCarbonite Recover\n\nBoasting push-button failover, Carbonite Recover is a DRaaS offering that reduces the risks of unplanned downtime and operations interruption by securely replicating critical applications and data to the Carbonite cloud. Subsequently, an up-to-date production environment becomes available for immediate failover.\n\nUsing Carbonite’s solution, primary servers can replicate in real-time, at the individual byte level, to the DRaaS cloud (Figure A). Organizations can perform their own non-disruptive, self-service tests, and access and view failover reporting. In the event organizations need more assistance, Carbonite’s technical services team can also provide support, including for deployment, testing and recovery.\n\nFigure A\n\nThe solution works by installing a Carbonite Recovery agent on each system to be protected. Following service configuration, those systems then begin sending encrypted data continuously, and with little adverse performance impact according to the vendor, to the Carbonite cloud.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, organizations can spin up the cloud-based replicas to recover operations. Then, once an organization is ready to return to using its primary production systems, the process is essentially reversed.\n\nSupported across a variety of environments, including Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, VMware and Hyper-V, pricing is based on the number of endpoints, the amount of data and the types of assistive services the organization selects.\n\nContact Carbonite directly at 1-877-542-8637 for more information or with questions.\n\nDatto ALTO & SIRIS\n\nDatto, whose acquisition by Kaseya was announced in April 2022, provides a range of DRaaS and BCDR offerings for MSPs (Figure B). The company’s ALTO and SIRIS solutions provide data protection solutions that also include full BCDR capabilities.\n\nFigure B\n\nDatto ALTO is a cost-effective and reliable hardware device that replicates an on-premises server and supports up to four Datto agents. The device serves as an onsite backup, but the solution also includes cloud-backup capabilities. Holding up to 2TB of data, customers can run operations from the device itself or from Datto’s cloud.\n\nDatto SIRIS is similar to ALTO except SIRIS permits managing an unlimited number of agents for accommodating more servers and virtual machines, including VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V VMs. SIRIS is scalable, as up to 120TB can also be backed up using the solution. With SIRIS, backups can be performed as frequently as every five minutes, including on Windows, Linux and Mac machines.\n\nDesigned for larger environments, Datto SIRIS supports physical, virtual and cloud infrastructure, permits restoring data from any point in time and enables replicating server images directly to the cloud. Ransomware protection, flexible restoration and indefinite cloud retention are other features.\n\nCost varies by the product and amount of data stored. Although Datto takes pains to simplify pricing, the firm works directly with MSPs, who are permitted to customize their own pricing plans. Because pricing can be included within MSP’s regular recurring monthly service agreements, organizations working with an MSP can wrap the DRaaS pricing directly within a monthly service contract, should an organization choose to do so.\n\nContact Datto for more information or to find a reseller at 1-888-294-6312.\n\nDRaaS Tierpoint\n\nTierPoint Disaster Recovery as a Service sells its DRaaS services directly to businesses.

Blockchain technology enables retailers to use smart contracts to resolve customer disputes without the intervention of a court. Smart contracts are stored in a digital ledger, allowing customers to securely record all transactions on the blockchain ecosystem, such as receipts, warranty documents, and insurance papers. The transaction is open to the public and cannot be changed or tampered with. All parties involved in the transaction are held accountable for their contractual obligations, and action is taken automatically if conditions are not met. For instance, an Israeli blockchain startup provides a blockchain application for retailers to improve overall efficiency in maintaining customer records such as warranty, insurance papers, and receipts. Customers can easily access information about their purchases and earn loyalty or reward points thanks to the information stored on the blockchain digital ledger.\n\nCustomers receive immediate assistance in the event of a product malfunction, without any service delays. Furthermore, blockchain allows retailers to access and accept cryptocurrencies rather than purchasing items through a payment processing system. It facilitates secure and authenticated online transfers. When compared to credit card payments, the blockchain payment process is less expensive.\n\nNorth America is expected to have the largest market share in the Blockchain market . Early Blockchain adoption, as well as the presence of several companies offering security and Blockchain solutions, are expected to drive market growth in the region. Companies in this region are increasingly implementing security and application security solutions to enable data security, prevent cyber-attacks and commercial espionage, and ensure data security and privacy for business continuity.\n\nAccording to TripleA, a cryptocurrency solution provider, more than 300 million people worldwide will use or own cryptocurrency in 2021. The growing demand for blockchain in the government sector is driving market growth, owing to benefits such as the protection of sensitive data, lower costs, and improved efficiency. Various government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the United States, are requesting blockchain-based applications to improve data security.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is funding start-ups to conduct research and development to investigate new approaches to cyber security using blockchain technology. Over the forecast period, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a positive impact on market growth. Growing online sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to drive demand for blockchain technology among e-commerce firms. This technology is used by e-commerce companies to manage their supply chains.\n\nThe report published by SkyQuest Technology Consulting provides in-depth qualitative insights, historical data, and verifiable projections about market size.

The move to Windows 11 was "99 percent successful," the announcement indicated.\n\nUpgrade failure numbers weren\'t described. Microsoft just indicated that some devices weren\'t upgraded and are continuing to run Windows 10 until "their next device refresh."\n\nMicrosoft Tools\n\nMicrosoft used its "rings" triage approach of upgrading smaller groups first to Windows 11, before extending the upgrade. It used own tools in the process, as follows:\n\nUpdate Compliance and Microsoft Endpoint Manager\'s endpoint analytics feature to gauge device readiness\n\nThe Windows Update for Business Deployment Service, which was said to reduce the number of policies needed for the Windows 11 deployments and allow for easy operating system rollbacks\n\nThe Windows Autopilot service for provisioning new machines built by original equipment manufacturer partners\n\nMicrosoft Power BI for tracking devices by "country and region" and Windows 11 upgrade "eligibility," and for notifying users not qualifying for an upgrade\n\n"Yammer, FAQs, Microsoft SharePoint, email, Microsoft Teams, our internal homepage, and digital signage" for communicating with employees about the upgrade.\n\nMicrosoft also let its employees check the ability to upgrade to Windows 11 via use of the PC Health Check app. However, its support teams "didn\'t get many upgrade tickets" as a result.\n\nMicrosoft claimed that this Windows 11 upgrade effort represented the "fastest deployment in company history."\n\nThe announcement did not mention using Microsoft Intune, the company\'s PC and mobile device management service for the Windows 11 deployments, but it described not using images, which is a typically touted Intune benefit.\n\n"Our success was built around several factors: far fewer app compatibility challenges than in the past, not needing to build out a plethora of disk images, and delivery processes and tools already that were greatly improved during the rollout of Windows 10," Microsoft indicated.\n\nWindows 11 Use Still Lags\n\nOf Microsoft\'s client operating systems, Windows 10 use predominates at 74.82 percent, vs. Windows 7\'s 12.11 percent and Windows 11\'s 8.45 percent, according to March 2022 information compiled by Statcounter.com.

Unfortunately, the Medic Agent itself can cause problems by having high RAM, high CPU, and high disk usage. Luckily, the WaaS MedicAgent can be disabled completely.\n\nWhat Is WaaSMedicAgent.exe?\n\nNo software is perfect — things go wrong, and files break, including Windows Updates (especially Windows Updates). Windows as a Service Medic Agent (WaaSMedicAgent) was introduced in Windows 10 to “Enable remediation and protection of Windows Update components.” In other words, it fixes problems with Windows Update that might prevent your PC from updating.\n\nThis process is supposed to run when Windows encounters a problem with an update. Unfortunately, the Medic Agent itself has been known to cause problems. In some cases, it bogs down PCs for hours by maxing out CPUs, causing extremely high RAM usage, and causing high disk usage.\n\nIs It Malware?\n\nWaaSMedicAgent.exe is a legitimate part of Windows 10 and Windows 11. It has occasionally caused problems that resemble malicious behavior, but it isn’t malware. Of course, it is relatively common for malware authors to try to disguise malware as legitimate applications and services. You can run a scan with Microsoft Defender and Malwarebytes’ Antivirus to rule out the possibility.\n\nHow to Disable WaaSMedicAgent\n\nThough it can be annoying, you should seriously consider whether or not you want to stop the executable from running and disable the service. Windows Update will still function even if Medic Agent is disabled, but it might not be able to recover from an error if one occurs during an update.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat said, if you want to disable WaaSMedicAgent, here are a few ways you can do it.\n\nDelay Your Updates\n\nWaaSMedicAgent should only be activated if Windows Update encounters an issue. Pausing Windows 10 or Windows 11 updates can temporarily stop WaaSMedicAgent from using excessive amounts of RAM, maxing out your disk usage, utilizing your CPU, and otherwise bogging down your PC. It won’t permanently solve any of your problems, though.\n\nIf you just need to get your system working for a bit pausing updates is a good option. Just remember to let it run later so it can try to fix whatever error occurred.\n\nDisable WaaSMedicAgent Using RegEdit\n\nWaaSMedicAgent is the Windows Service that is associated with WaaSMedicAgent.exe — if you want to stop the executable from running, you need to disable the service as well. Windows will not allow you to disable the service from the Services app, but you can disable it using the Registry Editor (RegEdit). As always, be careful editing the Windows Registry. Deleting a key accidentally — or even changing a value — can cause serious problems for computers, and major headaches for humans.\n\nRELATED: Learning to Use the Registry Editor Like a Pro\n\nFirst, you need to launch RegEdit. Click the Start button, type “regedit” into the search bar, and then hit Enter or click “Open.”\n\nNavigate to the following path in the Registry Editor window, or copy-paste the following line into its address bar and press Enter:\n\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WaaSMedicSvc\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWaaSMedicService is the name of the registry key. You’ll see it in the left pane. Registry keys are a bit like folders. They can contain subkeys, which are like subfolders, and properties, which are like files.\n\nEvery registry key found within “Services” will have a property named “Start” that determines when or why the service will be launched.\n\nStart can take a few different values:\n\n2 is “Automatic”\n\n3 is “Manual”\n\n4 is “Disabled”\n\nDouble-click the “Start” property in the right pane and change the value to 4, and then click “Ok.”\n\nTip: If you’ve used the Services app before, you might have noticed that some services are Automatic, but are specifically designed to start “Delayed.” The property that sets “Delayed” is named “DelayedAutoStart”. A value of 1 enables delayed automatic start, while 0 disables delayed automatic start.\n\nDisable Using Our Registry Keys\n\nIf you don’t want to mess with the registry yourself, there are two registry keys attached to this article. One is named “Disable_WaaSMedicSvc.reg” and will disable WaasMedicSvc (and WaaSMedicAgent.exe) completely. The other REG file is named “ReEnabled_WaaSMedicSvc.reg” and will return the service to its default value.\n\nWaaSMedic_Registry_Keys\n\nJust download the zip file, extract the contents anywhere, and double-click “Disable_WaaSMedicSvc.reg.” You’ll receive a warning about the dangers of applying registry keys — hit “Yes.”\n\nKeep in mind that other components of Windows Update will probably re-enable the Medic Service at some point in time in the future.

Meal kit services will send all the ingredients for any given recipe, usually premeasured and sometimes even prepped: as in chopped, minced or with certain dry ingredients already mixed together and ready to use. Convenient as they may be, most people consider meal kits to be a much more expensive alternative to buying groceries in a store. For certain services that's true but a crop of cheaper meal kit delivery services has significantly closed the gap. That's especially true considering the current inflation woes and rising cost of groceries.\n\nSo then, how much more expensive are meal kits versus buying the necessary groceries? I was wondering that very thing and with the cheapest meal kits clocking in at just $5 per serving, I had an inkling it would be pretty close. In calculating the grocery cost for two recipes from my favorite budget-friendly meal kit service, , it turns out just a measly buck or two separates the two mealtime approaches, and the perception of meal kits as pricey date-splurge may be more myth than reality in 2022.\n\nMeal kit vs. grocery store\n\nEveryPlate (meals for 2) EveryPlate (meals for 4) Groceries bought at the store Cost per serving $7.39 $6.50 $5.26\n\nSo how did I get these numbers?\n\nTo calculate the cost of meal kits when compared to buying the groceries, I took two EveryPlate recipes and priced out the ingredients. To keep things consistent I used the cheapest results that populated on , a popular online grocery delivery service here in the Northeast.\n\nSince spices are generally sold in 1- or 2-ounce bottles, I divided the cost by 20 since each bottle of spices contains roughly 20 servings. The same goes for ingredients like sour cream and soy sauce that are also sold in larger quantities. I divided the total cost by roughly how much you'd need to execute each recipe.\n\nRead more: Best Cheap Meal Delivery Services in 2022\n\nHow much does a meal kit service like EveryPlate cost?\n\nEveryPlate is one of the cheapest meal kit services, with clocking in at $5 a serving. For a meal plan for two people and three meals per week, it's slightly more at $5.89 a serving. I used the to compare with the cost of buying your own groceries. There's also a $9 flat shipping cost which I divided by the three meals. When it's all said and done, EveryPlate will cost you $7.39 a serving.\n\nEveryPlate\n\nHow much meal kits would cost if you bought the groceries\n\nBelow is a breakdown of what two would cost if you bought the groceries yourself. These prices were calculated from in early April of 2022. I didn't include the delivery fees for a grocery service or the cost of gas required to get yourself to and from the store. It's also worth noting that the grocery prices listed below are significantly lower than what I find at my local markets in Brooklyn.\n\nSmothered pork chops with home fries and carrots (2 servings)\n\nCarrots (12 ounces): $1.50\n\nFive Yukon gold potatoes: $1.50\n\nOne yellow onion: $0.90\n\n\n\nTwo scallions: $0.50\n\n\n\nTwo 5-ounce pork chops: $4.93\n\n\n\nOne packet of chicken stock concentrate: $0.60\n\n\n\nCayenne pepper: $0.20\n\n\n\nSour cream (2 ounces): $1.50\n\n\n\nTotal: $11.13\n\nCost per serving: $5.56\n\nEveryPlate\n\nCherry meatballs with zucchini and garlic mashed potatoes (2 servings)\n\nFive Yukon gold potatoes: $1.60\n\nWhite bread (one slice): $0.50\n\nOne zucchini: $1.50\n\nGround beef (8 ounces): $3.50\n\nCherry jam (1 ounce): $0.85\n\nGarlic powder: $0.10\n\nSour cream (2 ounces): $1.50\n\nSoy sauce (1 ounce): $0.50\n\nTotal: $10.05\n\nCost per serving: $5.02\n\nDavid Watsky/CNET\n\nHow much more is a meal kit than buying groceries?\n\nWhen compared to the cost of buying all the necessary groceries at the store, EveryPlate clocks in at around $2 more per serving. If you were to pick one of the plans with servings for four, it would be more like $1 more. So, it's pretty much a wash.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's convenience you're paying a little extra for. But if you choose a budget-friendly service such as EveryPlate or Dinnerly, that little extra turns out to be barely anything at all.\n\nRead more: EveryPlate Review: See How the Cheapest Meal Kit Service Holds Up in a Test\n\nWhat about the environmental cost, packaging and waste?\n\nThere's no doubt that meal kit services use more plastic than if you buy your own groceries. That said, the cheaper services have found ways to cut costs. In many cases, that means using less packaging.\n\nShelby Brown/CNET\n\nEveryPlate, for instance, is one of the most eco-friendly services I've tried. The company puts all its produce and other ingredients in a single cardboard box, whereas others individually package each ingredient, creating more waste. Most of the packaging, including the cooler box and ice packs are curbside recyclable.\n\nOn the flip side, since meal kits generally give you exactly what you need for each meal and no more, you're less likely to have food waste. Who hasn't thrown out those last few ounces from a tub of sour cream or a couple of scallions you couldn't find a use for before they wilted away?\n\nWhat about other meal kit services?\n\nEveryPlate is the cheapest meal kit service, along with The most expensive outfits -- Sunbasket, Green Chef, Martha Stewart and Marley Spoon and Blue Apron -- cost closer to $10 or $13 a serving. The added cost is generally due to premium ingredients like grass-fed beef and organic produce. With those, you're going to find a bigger delta between the meal kit cost and what it would cost to make the meal at home. Services like HelloFresh and Home Chef fall somewhere in the middle with meal kits ranging from around $8 and $10 a serving.\n\nNot interested in cooking at all?

Some services see it as a chance to encourage upgrades or just as free advertising for the paid service. Others, however, host third-party ads, which means you may be targeted based on your browsing habits—potentially killing the point of using a VPN in the first place—while others might be analyzing the websites you visit in the name of optimization or big data collection.\n\nIf you plan on using a VPN long term it’s a good idea to pay for the privilege. That way you get more server locations, more simultaneous device connections, and sometimes even better speeds. Restrictions on free services vary by service provider, but there are always restrictions of some kind.\n\nNevertheless, free VPNs are good if you just want to try out a service for a while, or if you only need a VPN every now and then. If you’re looking for a VPN for Windows here are our top recommendations.\n\nIf and when you decide to upgrade to full-fledged paid service, check out our comprehensive roundup of the best VPN services—our recommendations vary from this list once money is on the line.\n\n1. ProtonVPN – Best overall Best Prices Today: When it comes to Windows and free VPNs you can’t beat ProtonVPN. The free version only allows one device connection at a time per account, but that’s all you need if Windows is your focus. ProtonVPN’s speeds are second best in our tests of the paid services, but ProtonVPN does limit free account speeds somewhat to what it calls “Medium speed.” These speeds were entirely acceptable, however, for all the various things you might want to do such as video streaming or regular web browsing. Note, however, that explicit Netflix support is not part of the free offering. We also like ProtonVPN’s app design, which can be expanded to a larger version with an interactive map. Alternatively, it can be reduced to something more like a smartphone app. ProtonVPN requires an email address and password to use the free version and users are limited to three country choices. Read our full ProtonVPN review 2. Windscribe – Best for multiple devices Windscribe is the value choice if you want a lot of extra features and fewer limitations than other free services with one big exception. Namely, that you only get 10GB worth of data per month. That is not enough for a lot of video streaming, but it’s fine for everything else. As a trade-off there are no device limits and you get 10 location choices, which is more than most free services. The Windscribe app is also pretty straightforward Windscribe requires you to sign up with an email address. Read our full Windscribe Pro review 3. Hide.me – Also recommended Best Prices Today: Hide.me is a mix of both ProtonVPN and Windscribe. Similar to Windscribe you only get 10GB per month with the free version, and like ProtonVPN you only get one device at a time. Country choices are narrowed down to four with two regions in the U.S. for a total of five location options. Read our full Hide.me review\n\nWhat to look for in a free VPN on Windows\n\nWhen you’re shopping for a free service for Windows the criteria are similar to what you’d consider for a general free VPN. You want a service that is not displaying third-party ads or harvesting your browsing habits. Privacy is key with VPNs and even on a free one there’s no reason to compromise.\n\nNext, you can consider what’s important to you such as ease of use with an interface you understand, speeds, and country choices. That last point is going to be fairly restricted when going free, because that’s standard practice for free VPNs. Nevertheless, if you want a U.S. connection, for example, most free services will offer that.\n\nIf you’re hoping to use Netflix overseas with a free VPN you may be out of luck. Sometimes it might work on a regular U.S. server, but for the most part Netflix streaming requires specialty servers provided as part of a premium package. Other streaming services, however, may not be as picky as Netflix is when it comes to detecting VPN connections.\n\nHow we test VPNs\n\nAll VPNs tested on Windows go through a three-day process. Each day we test the VPN speeds in five different countries plus the base speed without a VPN connection. Each country is tested three times per day taking the average.\n\nWhen the testing is done we take the average of the base speed, and the overall global average of the VPN speeds. Then we represent the drop from the base speed as a percentage. The idea is to show how generally good a VPN is across all locations, and not just Europe or the United States. We also don’t show specific megabytes-per-second speed since those speeds can vary greatly, but how much dip to expect as a percentage can be more generalized.\n\nFree VPNs can sometimes hamper the speeds compared to what you see on free VPNs; however, that’s not as much of a concern here as all the VPNs we recommend have good speeds regardless.\n\nFinding a good free VPN for Windows is fairly simple. It all depends on whether you prioritize features like unlimited data usage, extra features, or a higher number of country options.', 'image': 'https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/free-gettyimages-1056445318-100825073-orig-100915024-orig-1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:12'}

The network focuses on e-commerce businesses via a suite of proprietary features and products. The goal of the project is to make it easy for businesses to seamlessly accept cryptocurrency payments. To this extent, Utrust continues to deliver with more businesses joining the protocol weekly.\n\nWhat Problems Does Utrust (UTK) Solve?\n\nOne of the primary issues that Utrust seeks to solve is slow business adoption. Cryptocurrencies are faster, more efficient, and secure than fiat currency, yet many businesses don’t accept these digital assets due to volatility concerns. There are businesses that want to accept cryptocurrencies, but don’t know where to begin to make the process a reality. Utrust was built to provide these users with full support.\n\nThe protocol helps to alleviate merchant concerns through its easy-to-navigate dashboard. New users can find all the features they need to start accepting crypto payments today. The system was built from the ground up to mitigate volatility and improve returns for merchants.\n\nConversion delays\n\nPart of this strategy includes reducing conversion delays. The crypto market is volatile with price changes happening every minute. As such, it’s vital for a merchant processor to complete transactions in near real-time to ensure no loss in value from the point of sale to the finalization of the transactions. Utrust provides immediate conversion from crypto to fiat currency to ensure there is no loss in value incurred by merchants.\n\nLack of Consumer Protection\n\nAnother major problem in the crypto merchant sector is a lack of consumer protections. Cryptocurrencies bring some advantages, but there are some caveats, such as the inability to refund on public blockchains. Utrust introduces a variety of buyer protections to improve the scenario.\n\nUtrust focuses on securing transactions between buyers and sellers. Specifically, buyers and sellers enjoy more flexibility such as the ability to communicate prior to the transaction to improve verification. This approach streamlines the exchange between both parties and improves the overall user experience.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation is another concern that has made headlines recently. Inflation occurs when a currency losses buying power. It’s one of the worst things that can happen to savers because it steals their wealth. Utrust integrates deflationary protocols to prevent inflation from causing issues to users.\n\nSpecifically, a small percentage of the fees are converted into UTK and burned. Burning tokens refer to removing them from circulation forever. To accomplish this task, the developers will send the tokens to an address that has no withdrawal option. The goal of this process is to reduce the overall supply. In turn, this drives up the demand which results in higher token values.\n\nBenefits of Utrust (UTK)\n\nThere are a lot of benefits that Utrust users gain. For one, the payment processing services were designed to provide seamless integration into current PoS systems. This easy onboarding benefits consumers and merchants as the protocol requires no previous experience to manage. Best of all, merchants receive their payments in fiat currency.\n\nDashboard\n\nThe Utrust interface is where users access all of the features of the network. The developer went to great lengths to ensure the dashboard was efficient and easy to navigate.\n\nLow Fees\n\nThose seeking an affordable alternative to PayPal and other centralized online payment processors should consider Utrust. The network has low conversion fees and there is no exchange rate fee when conducting transactions in the network’s native utility token, UTK. The network charges a small 1% commission and conversion fee for normal transactions.\n\nFlexibility\n\nAnother reason why Utrust has become so popular is its flexibility. The network supports different digital currencies and fiat currencies. As such, it operates as a low-cost solution for any business seeking a flexible international online payments processor.\n\nHow Does Utrust (UTK) Work\n\nUtrust works through a combination of systems. The network makes it easy to accept digital currencies. It combines the most popular features found on traditional payment gateways with the security of blockchain technology. This structure enables the protocol to conduct real-time business-to-consumer transactions.\n\nWhen a transaction is sent, the network automatically converts the cryptocurrency into fiat currencies in real-time. This process is completely autonomous and the network seeks out the lowest conversion rate as part of the process. Notably, there is a holding period in place for new merchants to prevent fraud. As your reputation builds and you conduct more transactions, the holding period gets waived.\n\nUtrust wallet\n\nThe Utrust wallet makes it simple to conduct crypto transactions. This versatile digital wallet can store a variety of popular ERC-20 tokens and popular cryptocurrencies. The protocol was built to operate on your favorite mobile device. Anyone can store their UTK tokens and buy products using this wallet.\n\nToken\n\nThe UTK token is an essential component of the Utrust network. It’s the main utility token for the Utrust system. Users save when they conduct transactions using this token. They can also send UTK across the globe in seconds using the peer-to-peer network. Notably, UTK is an ERC-20 standard token that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, it enjoys a high level of interoperability in the market.\n\nHistory\n\nUtrust entered the market in October 2017 during the crypto breakout. The network was founded by Artur Goulao, Filipe Castro, Nuno Correia, and Roberto Machado. It currently lists Sanja Kon as CEO. Kon has an expansive history of working as the Head of Marketplaces and Large Enterprises at PayPal. Today, Utrust is a top-performing crypto payment processor in the market.\n\nHow to Buy UTRUST (UTK)\n\nCurrently, UTRUST (UTK) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nBinance – Best for Australia, Canada, Singapore, UK and most of the world. USA residents are prohibited from buying UTRUST (UTK).

If you want to read about some more crypto firms, go directly to 5 Biggest Crypto Companies in the World.\n\nCryptocurrencies have witnessed increased institutional investor interest in recent months as inflation climbs and the appeal of popular coins as a safe haven and wealth storage device soars in a volatile marketplace. Chainalysis, a crypto information firm, revealed in a report on April 20 that crypto investors around the globe had realized total gains of $162.7 billion in 2021, up from just $35.5 billion in the previous year. The United States led other countries in these gains with over $47 billion, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan.\n\nOne of the interesting things highlighted in the report, and perhaps a stark reminder of the capabilities of the revolutionary blockchain technology, was that countries that do not rank high on traditional measures of economic prosperity, like the gross domestic product (GDP), usually outperform in the crypto space. For example, Turkey, which ranks 11th in the world in terms of GDP, is sixth in realized cryptocurrency gains at $4.6 billion. Ukraine, a symbol against Russian aggression, is 40th in GDP but 13th in realized cryptocurrency gains at $2.8 billion.\n\nThe report also discussed in detail the cryptocurrency developments in China, one of the largest crypto markets in the world. In 2021, the total estimated realized cryptocurrency gains for China were $5.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in 2020. Although this represented an annual growth rate of an impressive 194%, despite a regulatory crackdown against blockchain tech in China, it was far lower than growth rates of other crypto countries like the US, at 476%, and the UK, at 431%, and Germany, at 423%.\n\nEmerging Trends: Ethereum Edges Bitcoin, NFTs Explode\n\nAnother emerging theme within the crypto industry, which is gaining mainstream recognition through efforts of firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), is the performance of Ethereum, the second most-popular coin, against Bitcoin. Per Chainalysis, the total realized gains globally for Ethereum were $76.3 billion, compared to $74.7 billion for Bitcoin. Several experts had previously forecast that Ethereum was a better long-term investment than Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Tally Greenberg, the head of business development at crypto firm Allnodes, is of the opinion that “the technological advantage and utility of Ethereum blockchain is far greater than that of Bitcoin”. Megan Kaspar, the managing director of asset management firm Magnetic, has forecast that there will be an institutional investor shift towards Ethereum as the importance of new updates to the Ethereum network, which include a shift towards a more environmentally-friendly mining option, become more apparent.\n\nWithin the crypto sector, the non-fungible tokens marketplace is also exploding. NFTs are just one way in which blockchain technology can reshape the world around us. An NFT is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. Some examples include digital forms of photos, videos, and audio. A report by Nonfungible recently outlined that trading in NFTs climbed close to $18 billion last year, an increase of 21,000% from 2020.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe companies that operate in the crypto sector were selected for the list through a careful assessment of business fundamentals to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The growth catalysts for these firms are also discussed to paint a more holistic picture.\n\nBiggest Crypto Companies in the World\n\n10. Chainalysis\n\nChainalysis is a software firm that provides blockchain data and analysis to governments, banks, and businesses across the globe. One of the premier products of the company is compliance, regulatory, and investigative software related to blockchain technology. This software can detect and prevent various illegal activities like money laundering. This is a key competitive edge for the firm as hacks and related privacy concerns around blockchain tech are clouding the future development for the sector.\n\nOne statistics that highlights this competitive edge is the number of customers that Chainalysis serves. Nearly 650 organizations that include crypto exchanges, leading banks, payment processors, hedge funds and venture capital firms, use Chainalysis software. The firm recently launched Cross-Chain Investigations to Reactor, a tool that helps customers trace cryptocurrencies and related digital assets across blockchains. In June last year, the company had raised over $100 million at a Series C funding round at a valuation of over $4 billion.\n\nJust like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), Chainalysis is one of the crypto firms that elite investors are flocking to as the risk/reward profile of the growth sector improves.\n\n9. Uniswap\n\nUniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange that embraces the transparency at the center of the blockchain revolution. The exchange is used on blockchain networks that run open-source software. This is in contrast to other crypto exchanges that are run on centralized servers. A growing number of developers, traders, and liquidity providers are using the functionalities of the platform. Per the company, it has so far generated over $935 billion in trading volume and more than 95 million trades. The platform had more than three million users at the end of 2021.\n\nUniswap has the highest market shares among decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges at close to a quarter of all trades. It also has the highest daily trading volume in this group. On Uniswap, transactions are executed on-chain but there is no central authority that is facilitating these trades. Rather, users are free to interact with other users through a secure system and trade directly through their crypto wallets. These transactions are transparent and also open-source, decreasing the likelihood of money laundering.\n\n8. Kraken\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange and bank. It is based in California and was founded in 2011. The exchange already operates in more than 60 countries across the world. It was recently granted a license to start operations in the UAE as well. The Middle East is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets. Chainalysis estimates that nearly 7% of the global crypto trades originate from the region. Kraken is the first firm to offer direct trades of UAE dirhams against Bitcoin. The UAE trades about $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency each year.\n\nKraken is the fourth largest exchange in the world in terms of trading volume. More than six million users are on the platform for crypto trading. These users are spread across 190 countries. Jesse Powell, the CEO of the firm, has previously said that the exchange could go public in late 2022. The company is valued at close to $20 billion. The exchange has a daily trading volume in the hundreds of millions. In January last year, at the height of the crypto craze, the exchange did $56 billion worth of trading, more than the trading for the entire year in 2019.\n\n7. Sandbox\n\nSandbox is a metaverse platform. The platform, which initially started out as a game available for playing on computers and mobiles, operates on a play-to-earn model. The blockchain-based version of Sandbox allows users to create their own avatars, which can also be traded, to access different kinds of environments and games within the metaverse. The platform is the biggest of its kind in the crypto space and has more than 2 million users. These users can also trade in virtual real estate within the metaverse.\n\nIn 2021, the total land sales volume on Sandbox stood at over $350 million. Nearly 80% of this volume occurred in the last quarter of 2021. Secondary sales during the period were up more than 1.600% quarter-over-quarter. The number of active buyers on the platform grew in all four quarters of 2021 and increased by 37% between October and December. The median price for Sandbox land was $1,308 at the end of the third quarter but jumped to a median price of $11,364 by the end of the year.\n\n6. OpenSea\n\nOpenSea is a marketplace for non-fungible tokens. As of early 2022, the platform has more than 600,000 users. This represents a huge increase over March 2020, when the users on the platform numbered just 4,000. The monthly viewing numbers for the OpenSea website are more impressive. The site attracts over 120 million visits per month, per conservative estimates. This puts it far ahead of the competition in the NFT market sector. In 2021, the company made more than $365 million in revenue from NFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn 2020, the revenue of OpenSea was just $525,000. The difference highlights the incredible growth that NFTs have made in the crypto space. The marketplace charges 2.5% for every transaction on the platform. This is similar to what competitors like Rarible charge. The company is estimated to be worth more than $13 billion. So far, the firm has raised more than $427 million in financing over nine funding rounds. $300 million of this came at a Series C funding round in early 2022.\n\nIn addition to Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), OpenSea is one of the companies that institutional investors are monitoring.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Crypto Companies in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDisclosure.

After DeFi’s massive explosion in popularity in 2020, major projects such as Compound and Terra have seen unprecedented adoption.\n\nDecentralized cryptocurrencies are by nature trustless and permissionless, allowing any human with an internet connection and a phone to own them. DeFi makes this possible with dApps, as users rely on smart contracts, instead of centralized organizations, to create a secure network.\n\nDeFi cryptocurrencies are used in a multitude of ways, from utility to governance. For example: PancakesSwap users who HODL $CAKE have access to yield-farming opportunities, staking and on proposals made by the community to ‘govern’ the ecosystem.\n\nTop 5 DeFi Cryptocurrencies\n\nSchnoodle is a progressive DeFi cryptocurrency. It is the world’s first truly trustless DAO with advanced bespoke technology including an automated wealth distribution system known as BARK (Blockchain Automated Reward Kickbacks), and a neoteric Moon Farming Platform. It’s like yield farming, but on the moon.\n\n$LUNA is the native token of the Terra Network, a protocol based around Decentralized stablecoins. All stablecoins on the blockchain network are convertible into LUNA, the most important of them being their own stablecoin, UST (TerraUSD), created by Terra themselves.\n\nTheir mission is to reduce stablecoin volatility inside a cryptocurrency market known for its unpredictability. Reducing volatility attracts conversative investors and in-turn grows the crypto-sphere as a whole.\n\nLUNA is also the token used to pay transaction fees on its network, vote on governance proposals and help towards the validation of the Terra network through their Delegated PoS method.\n\nLet’s not forget, LUNA is backed and co-founded by one of the biggest ‘Crypto Celebrities’, Do Kwon.\n\nPancakeSwap is one of the largest DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) by volume, hosted on the Binance Smartchain. Following in Uniswaps footsteps, PancakeSwap has steadily grown its ecosystem, taking advance of Bsc’s low fees, to integrate many use cases into the $CAKE token to ensure its HODLers stay happy.\n\nWhenever a transaction is made on PancakeSwap, a proportion of the fee charged is instantly sent back to the liquidity pool as a reward, another portion being used for $CAKE buyback to create constant positive price action for the token. If you believe in DeFi, you believe in PancakeSwap.\n\nAnother DAO token, $CRV is the native token of Curve Finance; An Automated-Market Maker providing a DEX platform with a focus on stablecoins. If you’re looking to trade assets of the same value, such as stablecoins, Curve is the place to do it.\n\nDeep liquidity pools mean you can quickly, and with minimal spread, get any stablecoin on any blockchain network. $CRV is the governance token for the Curve network, where users can lockup their CRV tokens to receive veCRV, making them eligible to vote on proposals and receive staking rewards.\n\nCurve finance service is helping create a reliable way to ‘trade’ assets across DeFi, a service which has not yet been tackled and often taken for granted in CeFi. If DeFi gains mass adoption, so will Curve.\n\nCompound is a DeFi borrowing and lending protocol, aiming to provide what traditional banks provide in a decentralized manner. Users can deposit their crypto assets as lenders and receive rewards, whilst borrowers can take from liquidity pools through ‘collateralized loans’.\n\nWith over $500 million locked in their protocols, Compound is reshaping the way we think about loans, and the centralized finance system as a whole. Their native token, $COMP, is rewarded for many activities on their network such as withdrawals and borrowing crypto assets and is based on the amount of cTokens you hold.\n\nMoreover, COMP holders get access to Compound Governance, like most DeFi projects, to push the network forward in a decentralized way.\n\nSummary\n\nIf you truly believe in the core principles of cryptocurrencies; Trustless, Permissionless and Decentralized, then you believe in DeFi and what it could provide for millions around the world, unshackling them from the burden of corrupt or disinterested centralized authority.\n\nSimilar to any emerging market, not every project will survive. However, choosing projects such as Terra or Compound which solve fundamental problems within this emerging ecosystem gives you the best chance at picking a project with potential.\n\nFinally, supporting DeFi cryptocurrencies which help facilitate decentralized, peer-to-peer trade means you are directly moving the financial world in a direction that is better for the individual, creating a trustless ecosystem built on the back of open-source smart contracts.', 'image': 'https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TIM-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:17'}

The Optimism team revealed the news in a blog post Tuesday. The team also shared a list of criteria for airdrop eligibility, which includes items as simple as being an Optimism user to more advanced criteria such as being a DAO voter or multisig signer.\n\nThe token airdrop will be the first in a series of airdrops to be released in the coming months. While the team did not provide an exact date for the first airdrop, it took care to warn users that it is not live yet, and any attempt to convince users otherwise is a scam.\n\nThe token drop is part of a larger move to a more decentralized governance structure. The Optimism Collective, as it will be known as of today’s announcement, will feature a bicameral “house” system that divides governance roles among a Token House and a Citizens’ House. The Token House will be comprised of recipients of OP during the first airdrop; Optimism will add users to the Citizens’ House later by way of issuing “soulbound” NFTs that cannot be bought or sold. Together, the bicameral system in intended to mitigate the possible plutocratic tendencies of purely token-based governance.\n\nOptimism leverages a form of cryptographic technology called Optimistic Rollups to help Ethereum scale. By running its own network on top of the base chain, it can process transactions at a higher speed and lower cost than Ethereum mainnet while leveraging the security of the network. Optimism has a bridge that connects Ethereum mainnet to its Layer 2 network. Since launching in 2021, the network has welcomed key DeFi projects like Synthetix and Uniswap. In launching a token, Optimism will be adopting a decentralized governance model akin to many other similar DeFi projects on Ethereum.\n\nThe token announcement had been anticipated for several days, thanks mainly to an Apr. 19 Mirror post in which Optimism detailed a plan to start a new chapter “driven by community ownership and governance.” A leaked Coinbase page also appeared to list an Optimism token last week.\n\nLayer 2 Race Intensifies\n\nThe project has seen significant growth over the past few months amid increased focus on Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions. According to L2Beat data, the network holds about $662 million in total value locked, a sum that’s jumped 15% over the last week since the token rumors started to surface. Notably, although Optimism is currently benefiting from a wave of hype, it’s still lagging behind its biggest competitor, Arbitrum, another Layer 2 solution of the Optimistic Rollup variety holding $3.57 billion in total value locked—more than half the Ethereum Layer 2 market.\n\nWhile Optimism and Arbitrum are currently two of Ethereum’s biggest scaling weapons, that’s expected to change once ZK-Rollups like StarkWare’s StarkNet gain significant traction. Last week, the early Ethereum DeFi project MakerDAO outlined plans to launch on StarkNet commencing with a bridge launch this Thursday as part of its commitment to helping the Ethereum ecosystem scale (2022 is also a big year for the Ethereum protocol and its scaling roadmap, as it’s due to launch its highly anticipated “Merge” to Proof-of-Stake).\n\nWith Optimism now dropping a token, other similar Layer 2 protocols face a decision of whether to follow suit. In the world of DeFi, it’s not uncommon for projects to release a token once a competitor does to incentivize usage and help bootstrap growth. Either way, alongside the Merge, the race to build out Layer 2 is likely to become a key narrative in Ethereumland over the next few months.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, the author of this piece was eligible for Optimism’s token airdrop.

Unlike previous blockchains, which only served as digital ledgers for transaction data, Ethereum (ETH) could also support smart contracts, which are self-executing computer programmes. Since then, the technology has grown into a thriving ecosystem of dApps and DeFi products.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is now a thriving software and service ecosystem, but its popularity has exposed its lack of scalability. Fees have risen as more people have flooded the network with transactions, causing congestion. Of course, the developer community is working on a solution, but it won’t be ready until next year.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors such as Fantom (FTM) and FIREPIN Token (FRPN), which is going through its presale stage, have a chance to gain ground.\n\nHere’s what you should be aware of.\n\nFantom (FTM)\n\nIn December of this year, the Fantom (FTM) blockchain went live. The Lachesis protocol, a proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that boosts throughput to thousands of transactions per second, is the company’s main innovation. Fantom can also complete transactions in one or two seconds at a fraction of a cent per transaction. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, processes about 14 transactions per second and charges an average fee of more than $13.\n\nEven better, Fantom (FTM) is compatible with Solidity, the programming language used to create Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts. Developers can now quickly deploy Ethereum (ETH) based software and services on the Fantom (FTM) blockchain, improving performance and lowering costs. Yearn. finance, an Ethereum (ETH) based yield aggregator, for example, joined Fantom’s (FTM) rapidly growing network of DeFi services last October. Fantom (FTM) is currently the sixth most popular DeFi ecosystem, with nearly $6 billion invested.\n\nFantom’s (FTM) value proposition — fast and cheap transactions, as well as compatibility with Solidity — makes it an excellent candidate to disrupt Ethereum (ETH) in the coming years. What does this imply for financial investors? Fantom (FTM) has a market cap of only $3 billion. This is less than 1% of Ethereum’s (ETH) $365 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, as demand for Fantom (FTM) powered software and services grows, so will demand the FTM, pushing its price higher. And, based on its current price, investors would see a 120-fold return if its market cap reached that of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN)\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN) is up-and-coming crypto created especially for the Metaverse that enables transactions to be completed quickly and cheaply by utilising the most efficient blockchain at the appropriate time.\n\nIt has enjoyed impressive early-stage success, with a return of more than 150% for investors, since its highly anticipated presale, which began in late February – and it has all the right properties to transform the crypto market.\n\nThis metaverse-based token aims to solve a major problem in the crypto industry by providing a multi-chain solution, as well as a community-driven system centred on the Metaverse-based gaming industry, NFT games, and 3D technologies.\n\nIt comes at a critical juncture in Web 3.0 history, as Facebook changed its name to Meta in October of last year to reflect its new focus, whilst many other businesses and individuals are now looking for more decentralised cryptos to invest in.\n\nThe value of FIREPIN Token (FRPN) has risen 285% since the presale started, and continues to surge, with a further 96% value increase in one week alone, as the token strives to become the leading metaverse and NFT game development crypto for those who want to sell, buy, and trade virtual goods in the metaverse.\n\nBecause the project is planning to become a DAO, holders of the FIREPIN Token (FRPN) will be able to vote on how the crypto evolves and changes over time. Long-term investors are also rewarded weekly with more FRPN, thanks to the token’s reflection process which charges a 2% tax on all transactions and distributes some of it back to holders.\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN) is expected to have a total supply of 100 billion tokens across all protocols, with 30 million tokens set aside for the presale, which will run until mid May – meaning this is the last chance for potential investors to get in on FIREPIN Token (FRPN) at its lowest ever price.\n\nVerdict\n\nWhether or not Fantom and FIREPIN Token (FRPN) surpass Ethereum (ETH) in price and popularity, they could be rewarding long-term investments.\n\nThe blockchain industry is fiercely competitive, and the crypto market is notorious for its volatility. As a result, investors might benefit from following these simple guidelines: building a diversified portfolio — a mix of stocks and cryptos is a good place to start. Also, never invest money that you could need soon.\n\nLearn more about FIREPIN Token (FRPN) here:\n\nJoin Presale: https://presale.firepin.io/register\n\nWebsite: https://firepin.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/FIREPINOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FIREPIN_io\n\nDisclaimer: The information posted in the article is for educational purposes only.

You can invest in METIS today on Gate.io!\n\nDespite being the leading blockchain for building decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum is painfully slow, gas fees are too high when the network is busy and it’s expensive to store data on Ethereum. These serious issues must be addressed for the mainstream adoption of Ethereum as a sustainable and enjoyable platform to build applications. Layer 2 solutions –– projects that are designed to increase the speed and efficiency of specific blockchains –– solve these issues to a certain extent.\n\nMetisDAO (Metis) is one of the most promising Ethereum Layer 2 solutions that aims to solve Ethereum’s six biggest challenges: simplicity, speed, storage, scalability, security and savings. This way, Metis is able to offer extremely fast transactions that take just a few seconds and cost just a few cents, while maintaining the security of Ethereum Layer 1.\n\nThe entire goal of Metis is to build out Web3 infrastructure, allowing companies to operate entirely on the blockchain without coding templates. With arguably undervalued fundamentals, strong competitive advantages and a market capitalization rank that exceeds the top 200, METIS could be an extremely lucrative crypto gem to add to your portfolio before it reaches the masses.\n\nWhat is MetisDao?\n\nMetis is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that allows for cheaper and faster transactions. It facilitates the creation of a multipurpose, easy-to-use and scalable framework for apps and businesses transitioning from Web 2.0 to Web3.\n\nMore specifically, Metis deploys Optimistic Rollups, a type of Layer 2 construction built on top of Ethereum that allows smart contracts to be executed while being secured by Ethereum. The Metis Layer 2 network assumes all transactions are valid until proven otherwise –– hence the Optimistic part of Optimistic Rollup.\n\nUnlike many other Layer 2 solutions, Metis’ primary aim is to make developing decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized autonomous companies (DACs) on its platform easy and straightforward, especially for blockchain novices. By using Metis Polis, a middleware developed by the team to manage and interact with smart contracts, Metis aims to allow developers to integrate dApps into Metis Layer 2 with no blockchain coding.\n\nMoreover, the platform has various use cases such as blockchain-based crowdfunding, decentralized finance (DeFi)-powered social media platforms, integrated decentralized exchanges (DEXs), yield farming, open-source communities, development of investing and trading business models. In fact, the Metis team and early investors created a DAC with $100 million in grants exclusively earmarked to support high potential projects in all major crypto verticals including gaming, DeFi and DAOs.\n\nWho is Behind MetisDao?\n\nOne afternoon, two women –– Elena Sinelnikova and Natalia Ameline –– met for coffee to discuss how to make blockchain more accessible to the mainstream. As one idea transformed into another, and more individuals contributed to the idea, MetisDAO was soon born.\n\nMetisDao was founded by current CEO Elena Sinelnikova in 2019, with a simple-yet-ambitious goal of making blockchain simple and accessible to everyone. The team is experienced, has deep connections and can be verified online.\n\nElena is a well-respected blockchain educator, having founded CryptoChicks in 2017 –– an education nonprofit that focuses on blockchain education for women. Among the other competent members of the Metis team is Natalia Ameline, who is also the mother of Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum’s co-founder). Buterin has openly stated that Layer 2 solutions are pivotal for improving the scalability of Ethereum, and Metis aims to be the leading project that meets this need.\n\nThe project has acquired multiple significant partnerships recently with organizations including Tristan Metaverse, PAID Network, PARSIQ and OpenDeFi.\n\nMetisDAO Price History\n\nMetisDAO has a current market capitalization of roughly $215 million, placing it in the top 300 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. With a circulating supply of roughly 3 billion and a max supply of 10 billion METIS, METIS is down significantly from all-time highs during the current 2022 bear market. Bearish and fearful market sentiment presents a potential buying opportunity for investors who believe in the fundamentals of METIS.\n\nIt is important to note that 50% of the supply of METIS is reserved for community mining. Namely, the project offers member DACs a reward in METIS for each transaction conducted on the Metis platform. Projects will be financially incentivized to contribute to the long-term success of Metis platform and the token, ultimately helping grow the thriving Metis ecosystem.\n\nMetisDAO Competition\n\nArbitrum and Optimism are Metis’ core competitors. They are both Layer 2 solutions that also deploy Optimistic Rollups. However, despite the similar Layer 2 framework, Metis’ unique mission of making blockchain more accessible is a crucial differentiating factor that separates it from all other competitors.\n\nThis competitive advantage is primarily driven by MetisDAO’s middleware, Metis Polis, an innovative tool to move dApps and DACs to Metis with zero blockchain coding knowledge. With their middleware, all an entity needs to make the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 is a viable product to deploy. Under this framework, DACs will be able to deploy their own dApps and tokens with a click of a button while users will have access to roles, permissions, HR, payroll, communications and marketing.\n\nFor end users, Polis is another web wallet. However, with a Polis account, all transaction history will be recorded and eventually turned into Reputation Power –– a feature that will benefit users when they collaborate in a DAC (benefits such as higher decision-making power and more discounts).\n\nOverall, if successful, Polis will provide a significant incentive for DACs and end users, particularly those new to the blockchain space, to use Metis over Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nIn addition to making blockchain extremely accessible, Metis differs from Optimism and Arbitrum in the following ways:\n\nAt the time of writing, Metis is the only one of these solutions that has its own native token (METIS).\n\nMetis is less vulnerable to delay attacks than Optimism.\n\nMetis is more scalable than both Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nBuilder Mining: every time a dApp performs a transaction, the dApp generates a token reward –– an ecosystem incentive many other Layer 2s don’t have.\n\nAbritrum and Optimism both support intelligent contract execution, but only Metis provides InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)-integrated decentralized storage for smart contract computing –– support of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, applications, websites and data. In other words, it allows for users to directly store and download their NFTs on the Metis network at any time, right away.\n\nFor other Optimistic Rollups, the withdrawal time from Layer 2 to Ethereum is seven days. Currently, withdrawal times are a few hours, and once Metis is fully developed, they will be cut down to a few minutes. This goal will be achieved through a network of Rangers who validate transactions and Metis Virtual Machine (MVM).\n\nMVM is a virtual machine that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which separates the computing and storage of the Ethereum construct for Layer 2s. This feature ultimately allows for shorter wait times when withdrawing to the Ethereum network.\n\nRangers are financially incentivized to auditors or validators that stake and mine METIS to verify transactions. If they process a invalid transaction, their stake will be slashed, which disincentivizes bad actors. The process is secured by Ethereum’s Layer 1.\n\nHow to Buy METIS Tokens\n\nBest For Professionals Overall Rating Read Review get started securely through Gate.io’s website More Details Best For Professionals N/A 1 Minute Review Gate.io aims to be your one-stop shop for cryptocurrency trading.

Best For Beginners and professionals hoping to trade cryptocurrency across multiple markets\n\nAnyone concerned with security\n\nTraders needing additional information for their investments\n\nConsumers looking for an expansive rewards program Pros Many cryptocurrencies from which to choose\n\nMultiple trading styles\n\nEnhanced, industry-leading security\n\nLow fees\n\nQuality mobile app Cons Almost too much functionality\n\nA busy customer support system\n\nMETIS is already listed and trading on a few major exchanges such as Gate.io and Poloniex. At the time of writing, the Gate.io exchange possesses the most liquidity. The liquidity is predominantly centered around METIS/USDT trading pair.\n\nAdditionally, you can purchase METIS tokens on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Uniswap allows trading METIS tokens with the ETH pair and has the highest volume.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Outlook\n\nWhile METIS may boast a strong value proposition compared to other cryptocurrencies, like most altcoins, METIS is heavily affected by the general trends and sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. So far into 2022, the broader cryptocurrency market has been hammered by uncertain macroeconomic conditions, resulting in bearish and fearful market sentiment.\n\nIs MetisDAO a Good Investment?\n\nIf you believe in the importance of Layer 2 solutions, Metis could be a perfect choice. Metis’ layer 2 is highly scalable, fast and low-cost compared to Ethereum’s slow and expensive Layer 1. Additionally, with Ethereum as its base Layer 1, Metis’ level of security and decentralization is equivalent to Ethereum’s and is much higher than other alternative Layer 1s such as Solana, Avalanche and Cardano. As such, Metis can be viewed as the best of both worlds.\n\nEven after The Merge, formerly ETH 2.0, Layer 2 solutions will continue to play an important role in empowering Ethereum to realize its full potential and functionality, as stated by Buterin. The potential of METIS is boundless and limited only by the effort of the team and community. If Metis continues to execute its mission while successfully dealing with the challenges inherent to Optimistic Rollups such as bridging delays and the potential for fraud, an investment into METIS could prove to be a profitable endeavor.', 'image': 'https://www.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MetisDAO.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:18'}

The network focuses on e-commerce businesses via a suite of proprietary features and products. The goal of the project is to make it easy for businesses to seamlessly accept cryptocurrency payments. To this extent, Utrust continues to deliver with more businesses joining the protocol weekly.\n\nWhat Problems Does Utrust (UTK) Solve?\n\nOne of the primary issues that Utrust seeks to solve is slow business adoption. Cryptocurrencies are faster, more efficient, and secure than fiat currency, yet many businesses don’t accept these digital assets due to volatility concerns. There are businesses that want to accept cryptocurrencies, but don’t know where to begin to make the process a reality. Utrust was built to provide these users with full support.\n\nThe protocol helps to alleviate merchant concerns through its easy-to-navigate dashboard. New users can find all the features they need to start accepting crypto payments today. The system was built from the ground up to mitigate volatility and improve returns for merchants.\n\nConversion delays\n\nPart of this strategy includes reducing conversion delays. The crypto market is volatile with price changes happening every minute. As such, it’s vital for a merchant processor to complete transactions in near real-time to ensure no loss in value from the point of sale to the finalization of the transactions. Utrust provides immediate conversion from crypto to fiat currency to ensure there is no loss in value incurred by merchants.\n\nLack of Consumer Protection\n\nAnother major problem in the crypto merchant sector is a lack of consumer protections. Cryptocurrencies bring some advantages, but there are some caveats, such as the inability to refund on public blockchains. Utrust introduces a variety of buyer protections to improve the scenario.\n\nUtrust focuses on securing transactions between buyers and sellers. Specifically, buyers and sellers enjoy more flexibility such as the ability to communicate prior to the transaction to improve verification. This approach streamlines the exchange between both parties and improves the overall user experience.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation is another concern that has made headlines recently. Inflation occurs when a currency losses buying power. It’s one of the worst things that can happen to savers because it steals their wealth. Utrust integrates deflationary protocols to prevent inflation from causing issues to users.\n\nSpecifically, a small percentage of the fees are converted into UTK and burned. Burning tokens refer to removing them from circulation forever. To accomplish this task, the developers will send the tokens to an address that has no withdrawal option. The goal of this process is to reduce the overall supply. In turn, this drives up the demand which results in higher token values.\n\nBenefits of Utrust (UTK)\n\nThere are a lot of benefits that Utrust users gain. For one, the payment processing services were designed to provide seamless integration into current PoS systems. This easy onboarding benefits consumers and merchants as the protocol requires no previous experience to manage. Best of all, merchants receive their payments in fiat currency.\n\nDashboard\n\nThe Utrust interface is where users access all of the features of the network. The developer went to great lengths to ensure the dashboard was efficient and easy to navigate.\n\nLow Fees\n\nThose seeking an affordable alternative to PayPal and other centralized online payment processors should consider Utrust. The network has low conversion fees and there is no exchange rate fee when conducting transactions in the network’s native utility token, UTK. The network charges a small 1% commission and conversion fee for normal transactions.\n\nFlexibility\n\nAnother reason why Utrust has become so popular is its flexibility. The network supports different digital currencies and fiat currencies. As such, it operates as a low-cost solution for any business seeking a flexible international online payments processor.\n\nHow Does Utrust (UTK) Work\n\nUtrust works through a combination of systems. The network makes it easy to accept digital currencies. It combines the most popular features found on traditional payment gateways with the security of blockchain technology. This structure enables the protocol to conduct real-time business-to-consumer transactions.\n\nWhen a transaction is sent, the network automatically converts the cryptocurrency into fiat currencies in real-time. This process is completely autonomous and the network seeks out the lowest conversion rate as part of the process. Notably, there is a holding period in place for new merchants to prevent fraud. As your reputation builds and you conduct more transactions, the holding period gets waived.\n\nUtrust wallet\n\nThe Utrust wallet makes it simple to conduct crypto transactions. This versatile digital wallet can store a variety of popular ERC-20 tokens and popular cryptocurrencies. The protocol was built to operate on your favorite mobile device. Anyone can store their UTK tokens and buy products using this wallet.\n\nToken\n\nThe UTK token is an essential component of the Utrust network. It’s the main utility token for the Utrust system. Users save when they conduct transactions using this token. They can also send UTK across the globe in seconds using the peer-to-peer network. Notably, UTK is an ERC-20 standard token that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, it enjoys a high level of interoperability in the market.\n\nHistory\n\nUtrust entered the market in October 2017 during the crypto breakout. The network was founded by Artur Goulao, Filipe Castro, Nuno Correia, and Roberto Machado. It currently lists Sanja Kon as CEO. Kon has an expansive history of working as the Head of Marketplaces and Large Enterprises at PayPal. Today, Utrust is a top-performing crypto payment processor in the market.\n\nHow to Buy UTRUST (UTK)\n\nCurrently, UTRUST (UTK) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nBinance – Best for Australia, Canada, Singapore, UK and most of the world. USA residents are prohibited from buying UTRUST (UTK). Use Discount Code: EE59L0QP for 10% cashback off all trading fees.\n\nKuCoin – This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. This exchange currently accepts International & United States residents.\n\nGate.io – This exchange was established in 2013, and is one of the more popular & reputable exchanges. Gate.io currently accepts most international jurisdictions including Australia & the UK. USA & Canada residents are prohibited.\n\nHuobi Global – Established in 2013, Huobi Global has since become one of the world’s largest digital asset exchanges, with an accumulated trading volume of US $1 trillion. It should be noted that Huobi Global currently does not accept USA or Canadian residents.\n\nUtrust – Bridging the Gap\n\nThe Utrust strategy is to help bring more businesses into the crypto sphere. This makes sense as they have the most to gain from such a venture. Additionally, this step is essential to drive large-scale crypto adoption in the future. For these reasons, you can expect to see Utrust continue to expand its network of merchants and users over the coming months.', 'image': 'https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/KqGSM2A.h-iG~1d34f/w:1000/h:600/q:mauto/rt:fill/g:ce/https://www.securities.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/UTRUST.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:27'}

If you want to read about some more crypto firms, go directly to 5 Biggest Crypto Companies in the World.\n\nCryptocurrencies have witnessed increased institutional investor interest in recent months as inflation climbs and the appeal of popular coins as a safe haven and wealth storage device soars in a volatile marketplace. Chainalysis, a crypto information firm, revealed in a report on April 20 that crypto investors around the globe had realized total gains of $162.7 billion in 2021, up from just $35.5 billion in the previous year. The United States led other countries in these gains with over $47 billion, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan.\n\nOne of the interesting things highlighted in the report, and perhaps a stark reminder of the capabilities of the revolutionary blockchain technology, was that countries that do not rank high on traditional measures of economic prosperity, like the gross domestic product (GDP), usually outperform in the crypto space. For example, Turkey, which ranks 11th in the world in terms of GDP, is sixth in realized cryptocurrency gains at $4.6 billion. Ukraine, a symbol against Russian aggression, is 40th in GDP but 13th in realized cryptocurrency gains at $2.8 billion.\n\nThe report also discussed in detail the cryptocurrency developments in China, one of the largest crypto markets in the world. In 2021, the total estimated realized cryptocurrency gains for China were $5.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in 2020. Although this represented an annual growth rate of an impressive 194%, despite a regulatory crackdown against blockchain tech in China, it was far lower than growth rates of other crypto countries like the US, at 476%, and the UK, at 431%, and Germany, at 423%.\n\nEmerging Trends: Ethereum Edges Bitcoin, NFTs Explode\n\nAnother emerging theme within the crypto industry, which is gaining mainstream recognition through efforts of firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), is the performance of Ethereum, the second most-popular coin, against Bitcoin. Per Chainalysis, the total realized gains globally for Ethereum were $76.3 billion, compared to $74.7 billion for Bitcoin. Several experts had previously forecast that Ethereum was a better long-term investment than Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Tally Greenberg, the head of business development at crypto firm Allnodes, is of the opinion that “the technological advantage and utility of Ethereum blockchain is far greater than that of Bitcoin”. Megan Kaspar, the managing director of asset management firm Magnetic, has forecast that there will be an institutional investor shift towards Ethereum as the importance of new updates to the Ethereum network, which include a shift towards a more environmentally-friendly mining option, become more apparent.\n\nWithin the crypto sector, the non-fungible tokens marketplace is also exploding. NFTs are just one way in which blockchain technology can reshape the world around us. An NFT is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. Some examples include digital forms of photos, videos, and audio. A report by Nonfungible recently outlined that trading in NFTs climbed close to $18 billion last year, an increase of 21,000% from 2020.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe companies that operate in the crypto sector were selected for the list through a careful assessment of business fundamentals to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The growth catalysts for these firms are also discussed to paint a more holistic picture.\n\nBiggest Crypto Companies in the World\n\n10. Chainalysis\n\nChainalysis is a software firm that provides blockchain data and analysis to governments, banks, and businesses across the globe. One of the premier products of the company is compliance, regulatory, and investigative software related to blockchain technology. This software can detect and prevent various illegal activities like money laundering. This is a key competitive edge for the firm as hacks and related privacy concerns around blockchain tech are clouding the future development for the sector.\n\nOne statistics that highlights this competitive edge is the number of customers that Chainalysis serves. Nearly 650 organizations that include crypto exchanges, leading banks, payment processors, hedge funds and venture capital firms, use Chainalysis software. The firm recently launched Cross-Chain Investigations to Reactor, a tool that helps customers trace cryptocurrencies and related digital assets across blockchains. In June last year, the company had raised over $100 million at a Series C funding round at a valuation of over $4 billion.\n\nJust like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), Chainalysis is one of the crypto firms that elite investors are flocking to as the risk/reward profile of the growth sector improves.\n\n9. Uniswap\n\nUniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange that embraces the transparency at the center of the blockchain revolution. The exchange is used on blockchain networks that run open-source software. This is in contrast to other crypto exchanges that are run on centralized servers. A growing number of developers, traders, and liquidity providers are using the functionalities of the platform. Per the company, it has so far generated over $935 billion in trading volume and more than 95 million trades. The platform had more than three million users at the end of 2021.\n\nUniswap has the highest market shares among decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges at close to a quarter of all trades. It also has the highest daily trading volume in this group. On Uniswap, transactions are executed on-chain but there is no central authority that is facilitating these trades. Rather, users are free to interact with other users through a secure system and trade directly through their crypto wallets. These transactions are transparent and also open-source, decreasing the likelihood of money laundering.\n\n8. Kraken\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange and bank. It is based in California and was founded in 2011. The exchange already operates in more than 60 countries across the world. It was recently granted a license to start operations in the UAE as well. The Middle East is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets. Chainalysis estimates that nearly 7% of the global crypto trades originate from the region. Kraken is the first firm to offer direct trades of UAE dirhams against Bitcoin. The UAE trades about $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency each year.\n\nKraken is the fourth largest exchange in the world in terms of trading volume. More than six million users are on the platform for crypto trading. These users are spread across 190 countries. Jesse Powell, the CEO of the firm, has previously said that the exchange could go public in late 2022. The company is valued at close to $20 billion. The exchange has a daily trading volume in the hundreds of millions. In January last year, at the height of the crypto craze, the exchange did $56 billion worth of trading, more than the trading for the entire year in 2019.\n\n7. Sandbox\n\nSandbox is a metaverse platform. The platform, which initially started out as a game available for playing on computers and mobiles, operates on a play-to-earn model. The blockchain-based version of Sandbox allows users to create their own avatars, which can also be traded, to access different kinds of environments and games within the metaverse. The platform is the biggest of its kind in the crypto space and has more than 2 million users. These users can also trade in virtual real estate within the metaverse.\n\nIn 2021, the total land sales volume on Sandbox stood at over $350 million. Nearly 80% of this volume occurred in the last quarter of 2021. Secondary sales during the period were up more than 1.600% quarter-over-quarter. The number of active buyers on the platform grew in all four quarters of 2021 and increased by 37% between October and December. The median price for Sandbox land was $1,308 at the end of the third quarter but jumped to a median price of $11,364 by the end of the year.\n\n6. OpenSea\n\nOpenSea is a marketplace for non-fungible tokens. As of early 2022, the platform has more than 600,000 users. This represents a huge increase over March 2020, when the users on the platform numbered just 4,000. The monthly viewing numbers for the OpenSea website are more impressive. The site attracts over 120 million visits per month, per conservative estimates. This puts it far ahead of the competition in the NFT market sector. In 2021, the company made more than $365 million in revenue from NFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn 2020, the revenue of OpenSea was just $525,000. The difference highlights the incredible growth that NFTs have made in the crypto space. The marketplace charges 2.5% for every transaction on the platform. This is similar to what competitors like Rarible charge. The company is estimated to be worth more than $13 billion. So far, the firm has raised more than $427 million in financing over nine funding rounds. $300 million of this came at a Series C funding round in early 2022.\n\nIn addition to Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), OpenSea is one of the companies that institutional investors are monitoring.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Crypto Companies in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDisclosure.

Look no further than the industry\'s biggest names: Bitcoin (BTC -5.58%) and Ethereum (ETH -6.22%). Let\'s explore why these "blue chip" cryptos have what it takes to maintain their huge leads over rivals.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nLaunched in 2009, Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency that started it all. And despite technical weaknesses, the platform still dominates crypto with a market cap of $788 billion -- a full 41% of the total industry. Bitcoin can remain a great investment for decades to come because of its unparalleled brand recognition and maturity.\n\nBitcoin has a transaction capacity of just five per second and doesn\'t support decentralized applications (dApps) that use smart contracts to offer services on the blockchain. But this doesn\'t destroy its value proposition. Think of Bitcoin as digital gold. Gold is not the rarest metal, nor is it the most useful. But it has value because of its history and acceptance. People agree that it is valuable, so it is.\n\nBitcoins\' first-mover advantage also gives it some fundamental advantages. According to the crypto directory, Cryptwerk, almost 8,000 listed merchants accept Bitcoin as payment compared to just over 4,000 for its closest rival, Ethereum. The platform\'s age also means it\'s hugely decentralized, with the top 10 holders only controlling 5.6% of the coins in circulation. For newer platforms like Shiba Inu, the top 10 holders control 64% of the units in circulation, increasing the risk of price manipulation.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nWhile Bitcoin was the first public blockchain to hit the market, Ethereum was the first to expand the technology\'s use-cases through dApps, giving it a big advantage in attracting users and developers. While Ethereum faces an arguably tougher challenge from newer, faster rivals, its development team looks up to the job.\n\nDecentralized applications use self-executing smart contracts to offer blockchain-based services ranging from cryptocurrency exchanges to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can be used to create digital art and collectibles. Ethereum is the leader in virtually all dApp categories, hosting almost 3,000 of the roughly 4,000 total projects, according to crypto analytics site stateofthedapps.com.\n\nThat said, dApps dramatically increase transaction volume on the network, so Ethereum (which only handles 15 transactions per second) probably won\'t be able to rest on its laurels like its simpler counterpart Bitcoin. It will need to get dramatically faster to stay relevant.\n\nTo meet the growing demand, Ethereum\'s developers are working on an upgrade called The Merge, which will change the blockchain\'s current proof-of-work consensus mechanism (where miners solve computation puzzles to verify transactions) to a proof-of-stake system where miners will use their existing coins. It is unclear when this change will go live -- or how much faster it will make Ethereum. But the platform has a track record of successful updates.\n\nBlue chip cryptocurrencies?\n\nIn the stock market, blue-chip stocks are shares of well-known, well-established industry leaders. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the cryptocurrency equivalent. Their first-mover advantages, strong brands, and active development teams will help them stay relevant in the increasingly competitive blockchain opportunity.', 'image': 'https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/675938/gettyimages-1323758599.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:28'}

Crypto experts believe that cryptos with consistent network updates are a safe bet for both new and seasoned crypto investors. Quitriam Finance (QTM), a crypto market newcomer with a strong trajectory, is predicted to deliver huge gains to early investors.\n\nQuitriam Finance (QTM)\n\nIt’s a fantastic time to invest in Quitriam Finance (QTM), one of the most interesting new crypto projects (QTM). The QTM coin, which is currently available for presale, has already experienced promising increases of over 54% and is likely to impress its early investors in the coming weeks. A coin’s price cannot decline during this stage, presales provide reduced prices and the potential for higher capital growth.\n\nQuitriam Finance (QTM) is a decentralised multi-chain AMM, incubator, yield farming, and NFT launch with the unique objective of establishing an inclusive DeFi (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem powered by a faster, cheaper, and more accessible multi-chain AMM.

BoostX is known for its dynamic cryptocurrency launchpad, which is dedicated to ensuring that new ventures succeed on the market. Even though they are new to the business, BoostX has already established an amazing track record by successfully participating in multiple Initial Coin Offering (ICO) launches and presales.\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is one of the most widely used digital currencies, having been one of the first few cryptocurrencies established after Bitcoin. Litecoin seeks to deliver quick, inexpensive, and secure payment options by utilising blockchain technology. Despite its long history in the crypto market, LTC is still regarded as a sound investment.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is on a quest to bring about massive changes. It has recently joined the gaming and non-financial transaction (NFT) industries. Litecoin used OmniLite, a second-layer solution for smart contract development, to keep up with the competition. Litecoin Mimblewimble is the most recent network update. Many blockchain features will be improved, with a particular focus on boosting privacy. Scalability, fungibility, and crypto anonymity will all be supported by the system.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market, will be upgraded to ETH 2.0 in Q3 2022. It is projected to take blockchain development to the next level, despite considerable delays till 2019. Ethereum’s power consumption should be reduced as it transitions to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. Ethereum expects to perform 150,000 transactions per second once all updates have been deployed.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralised open-source blockchain architecture that serves as a foundation for a variety of cryptocurrencies.

Unlike previous blockchains, which only served as digital ledgers for transaction data, Ethereum (ETH) could also support smart contracts, which are self-executing computer programmes. Since then, the technology has grown into a thriving ecosystem of dApps and DeFi products.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is now a thriving software and service ecosystem, but its popularity has exposed its lack of scalability. Fees have risen as more people have flooded the network with transactions, causing congestion. Of course, the developer community is working on a solution, but it won’t be ready until next year.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors such as Fantom (FTM) and FIREPIN Token (FRPN), which is going through its presale stage, have a chance to gain ground.\n\nHere’s what you should be aware of.\n\nFantom (FTM)\n\nIn December of this year, the Fantom (FTM) blockchain went live. The Lachesis protocol, a proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that boosts throughput to thousands of transactions per second, is the company’s main innovation. Fantom can also complete transactions in one or two seconds at a fraction of a cent per transaction. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, processes about 14 transactions per second and charges an average fee of more than $13.\n\nEven better, Fantom (FTM) is compatible with Solidity, the programming language used to create Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts. Developers can now quickly deploy Ethereum (ETH) based software and services on the Fantom (FTM) blockchain, improving performance and lowering costs. Yearn. finance, an Ethereum (ETH) based yield aggregator, for example, joined Fantom’s (FTM) rapidly growing network of DeFi services last October. Fantom (FTM) is currently the sixth most popular DeFi ecosystem, with nearly $6 billion invested.\n\nFantom’s (FTM) value proposition — fast and cheap transactions, as well as compatibility with Solidity — makes it an excellent candidate to disrupt Ethereum (ETH) in the coming years. What does this imply for financial investors? Fantom (FTM) has a market cap of only $3 billion. This is less than 1% of Ethereum’s (ETH) $365 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, as demand for Fantom (FTM) powered software and services grows, so will demand the FTM, pushing its price higher. And, based on its current price, investors would see a 120-fold return if its market cap reached that of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN)\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN) is up-and-coming crypto created especially for the Metaverse that enables transactions to be completed quickly and cheaply by utilising the most efficient blockchain at the appropriate time.\n\nIt has enjoyed impressive early-stage success, with a return of more than 150% for investors, since its highly anticipated presale, which began in late February – and it has all the right properties to transform the crypto market.\n\nThis metaverse-based token aims to solve a major problem in the crypto industry by providing a multi-chain solution, as well as a community-driven system centred on the Metaverse-based gaming industry, NFT games, and 3D technologies.\n\nIt comes at a critical juncture in Web 3.0 history, as Facebook changed its name to Meta in October of last year to reflect its new focus, whilst many other businesses and individuals are now looking for more decentralised cryptos to invest in.\n\nThe value of FIREPIN Token (FRPN) has risen 285% since the presale started, and continues to surge, with a further 96% value increase in one week alone, as the token strives to become the leading metaverse and NFT game development crypto for those who want to sell, buy, and trade virtual goods in the metaverse.\n\nBecause the project is planning to become a DAO, holders of the FIREPIN Token (FRPN) will be able to vote on how the crypto evolves and changes over time. Long-term investors are also rewarded weekly with more FRPN, thanks to the token’s reflection process which charges a 2% tax on all transactions and distributes some of it back to holders.\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN) is expected to have a total supply of 100 billion tokens across all protocols, with 30 million tokens set aside for the presale, which will run until mid May – meaning this is the last chance for potential investors to get in on FIREPIN Token (FRPN) at its lowest ever price.\n\nVerdict\n\nWhether or not Fantom and FIREPIN Token (FRPN) surpass Ethereum (ETH) in price and popularity, they could be rewarding long-term investments.\n\nThe blockchain industry is fiercely competitive, and the crypto market is notorious for its volatility. As a result, investors might benefit from following these simple guidelines: building a diversified portfolio — a mix of stocks and cryptos is a good place to start. Also, never invest money that you could need soon.\n\nLearn more about FIREPIN Token (FRPN) here:\n\nJoin Presale: https://presale.firepin.io/register\n\nWebsite: https://firepin.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/FIREPINOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FIREPIN_io\n\nDisclaimer: The information posted in the article is for educational purposes only.

You can invest in METIS today on Gate.io!\n\nDespite being the leading blockchain for building decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum is painfully slow, gas fees are too high when the network is busy and it’s expensive to store data on Ethereum. These serious issues must be addressed for the mainstream adoption of Ethereum as a sustainable and enjoyable platform to build applications. Layer 2 solutions –– projects that are designed to increase the speed and efficiency of specific blockchains –– solve these issues to a certain extent.\n\nMetisDAO (Metis) is one of the most promising Ethereum Layer 2 solutions that aims to solve Ethereum’s six biggest challenges: simplicity, speed, storage, scalability, security and savings. This way, Metis is able to offer extremely fast transactions that take just a few seconds and cost just a few cents, while maintaining the security of Ethereum Layer 1.\n\nThe entire goal of Metis is to build out Web3 infrastructure, allowing companies to operate entirely on the blockchain without coding templates. With arguably undervalued fundamentals, strong competitive advantages and a market capitalization rank that exceeds the top 200, METIS could be an extremely lucrative crypto gem to add to your portfolio before it reaches the masses.\n\nWhat is MetisDao?\n\nMetis is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that allows for cheaper and faster transactions. It facilitates the creation of a multipurpose, easy-to-use and scalable framework for apps and businesses transitioning from Web 2.0 to Web3.\n\nMore specifically, Metis deploys Optimistic Rollups, a type of Layer 2 construction built on top of Ethereum that allows smart contracts to be executed while being secured by Ethereum. The Metis Layer 2 network assumes all transactions are valid until proven otherwise –– hence the Optimistic part of Optimistic Rollup.\n\nUnlike many other Layer 2 solutions, Metis’ primary aim is to make developing decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized autonomous companies (DACs) on its platform easy and straightforward, especially for blockchain novices. By using Metis Polis, a middleware developed by the team to manage and interact with smart contracts, Metis aims to allow developers to integrate dApps into Metis Layer 2 with no blockchain coding.\n\nMoreover, the platform has various use cases such as blockchain-based crowdfunding, decentralized finance (DeFi)-powered social media platforms, integrated decentralized exchanges (DEXs), yield farming, open-source communities, development of investing and trading business models. In fact, the Metis team and early investors created a DAC with $100 million in grants exclusively earmarked to support high potential projects in all major crypto verticals including gaming, DeFi and DAOs.\n\nWho is Behind MetisDao?\n\nOne afternoon, two women –– Elena Sinelnikova and Natalia Ameline –– met for coffee to discuss how to make blockchain more accessible to the mainstream. As one idea transformed into another, and more individuals contributed to the idea, MetisDAO was soon born.\n\nMetisDao was founded by current CEO Elena Sinelnikova in 2019, with a simple-yet-ambitious goal of making blockchain simple and accessible to everyone. The team is experienced, has deep connections and can be verified online.\n\nElena is a well-respected blockchain educator, having founded CryptoChicks in 2017 –– an education nonprofit that focuses on blockchain education for women. Among the other competent members of the Metis team is Natalia Ameline, who is also the mother of Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum’s co-founder). Buterin has openly stated that Layer 2 solutions are pivotal for improving the scalability of Ethereum, and Metis aims to be the leading project that meets this need.\n\nThe project has acquired multiple significant partnerships recently with organizations including Tristan Metaverse, PAID Network, PARSIQ and OpenDeFi.\n\nMetisDAO Price History\n\nMetisDAO has a current market capitalization of roughly $215 million, placing it in the top 300 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. With a circulating supply of roughly 3 billion and a max supply of 10 billion METIS, METIS is down significantly from all-time highs during the current 2022 bear market. Bearish and fearful market sentiment presents a potential buying opportunity for investors who believe in the fundamentals of METIS.\n\nIt is important to note that 50% of the supply of METIS is reserved for community mining. Namely, the project offers member DACs a reward in METIS for each transaction conducted on the Metis platform. Projects will be financially incentivized to contribute to the long-term success of Metis platform and the token, ultimately helping grow the thriving Metis ecosystem.\n\nMetisDAO Competition\n\nArbitrum and Optimism are Metis’ core competitors. They are both Layer 2 solutions that also deploy Optimistic Rollups. However, despite the similar Layer 2 framework, Metis’ unique mission of making blockchain more accessible is a crucial differentiating factor that separates it from all other competitors.\n\nThis competitive advantage is primarily driven by MetisDAO’s middleware, Metis Polis, an innovative tool to move dApps and DACs to Metis with zero blockchain coding knowledge. With their middleware, all an entity needs to make the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 is a viable product to deploy. Under this framework, DACs will be able to deploy their own dApps and tokens with a click of a button while users will have access to roles, permissions, HR, payroll, communications and marketing.\n\nFor end users, Polis is another web wallet. However, with a Polis account, all transaction history will be recorded and eventually turned into Reputation Power –– a feature that will benefit users when they collaborate in a DAC (benefits such as higher decision-making power and more discounts).\n\nOverall, if successful, Polis will provide a significant incentive for DACs and end users, particularly those new to the blockchain space, to use Metis over Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nIn addition to making blockchain extremely accessible, Metis differs from Optimism and Arbitrum in the following ways:\n\nAt the time of writing, Metis is the only one of these solutions that has its own native token (METIS).\n\nMetis is less vulnerable to delay attacks than Optimism.\n\nMetis is more scalable than both Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nBuilder Mining: every time a dApp performs a transaction, the dApp generates a token reward –– an ecosystem incentive many other Layer 2s don’t have.\n\nAbritrum and Optimism both support intelligent contract execution, but only Metis provides InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)-integrated decentralized storage for smart contract computing –– support of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, applications, websites and data. In other words, it allows for users to directly store and download their NFTs on the Metis network at any time, right away.\n\nFor other Optimistic Rollups, the withdrawal time from Layer 2 to Ethereum is seven days. Currently, withdrawal times are a few hours, and once Metis is fully developed, they will be cut down to a few minutes. This goal will be achieved through a network of Rangers who validate transactions and Metis Virtual Machine (MVM).\n\nMVM is a virtual machine that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which separates the computing and storage of the Ethereum construct for Layer 2s. This feature ultimately allows for shorter wait times when withdrawing to the Ethereum network.\n\nRangers are financially incentivized to auditors or validators that stake and mine METIS to verify transactions. If they process a invalid transaction, their stake will be slashed, which disincentivizes bad actors. The process is secured by Ethereum’s Layer 1.\n\nHow to Buy METIS Tokens\n\nBest For Professionals Overall Rating Read Review get started securely through Gate.io’s website More Details Best For Professionals N/A 1 Minute Review Gate.io aims to be your one-stop shop for cryptocurrency trading. The platform carries nearly 200 different currencies spread across over 350 markets. Traders can buy and sell cryptocurrency, with spot and margin trading being the most commonly used markets. The platform also allows traders to use peer-to-peer transactions through its “push transaction” function. Multiple security protocols ensure your safety while using mobile or desktop browsers. Plus, a trading guide explains how to use the system for your first few trades. Not sure if you can trade your preferred currency? There’s a “Coin List” at the bottom of the homepage. Best For Beginners and professionals hoping to trade cryptocurrency across multiple markets\n\nAnyone concerned with security\n\nTraders needing additional information for their investments\n\nConsumers looking for an expansive rewards program Pros Many cryptocurrencies from which to choose\n\nMultiple trading styles\n\nEnhanced, industry-leading security\n\nLow fees\n\nQuality mobile app Cons Almost too much functionality\n\nA busy customer support system\n\nMETIS is already listed and trading on a few major exchanges such as Gate.io and Poloniex. At the time of writing, the Gate.io exchange possesses the most liquidity. The liquidity is predominantly centered around METIS/USDT trading pair.\n\nAdditionally, you can purchase METIS tokens on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Uniswap allows trading METIS tokens with the ETH pair and has the highest volume.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Outlook\n\nWhile METIS may boast a strong value proposition compared to other cryptocurrencies, like most altcoins, METIS is heavily affected by the general trends and sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. So far into 2022, the broader cryptocurrency market has been hammered by uncertain macroeconomic conditions, resulting in bearish and fearful market sentiment.\n\nIs MetisDAO a Good Investment?\n\nIf you believe in the importance of Layer 2 solutions, Metis could be a perfect choice. Metis’ layer 2 is highly scalable, fast and low-cost compared to Ethereum’s slow and expensive Layer 1. Additionally, with Ethereum as its base Layer 1, Metis’ level of security and decentralization is equivalent to Ethereum’s and is much higher than other alternative Layer 1s such as Solana, Avalanche and Cardano. As such, Metis can be viewed as the best of both worlds.\n\nEven after The Merge, formerly ETH 2.0, Layer 2 solutions will continue to play an important role in empowering Ethereum to realize its full potential and functionality, as stated by Buterin. The potential of METIS is boundless and limited only by the effort of the team and community. If Metis continues to execute its mission while successfully dealing with the challenges inherent to Optimistic Rollups such as bridging delays and the potential for fraud, an investment into METIS could prove to be a profitable endeavor.', 'image': 'https://www.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MetisDAO.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:18'}

For more info, visit our Terms of Use page\n\nFacing a multitude of threats to systems and data, everyone from small and medium businesses to large enterprises and nonprofits are turning to cloud backup and recovery services. Combining both data backup protections and recovery capabilities, disaster recovery as a service solutions help ensure continued operations should a catastrophe, failure, accident or other adverse event occur.\n\nJump to:\n\nSEE: Hiring Kit: Database engineer (TechRepublic Premium)\n\nWhat is disaster recovery as a service?\n\nDRaaS is a cloud computing strategy in which an organization pays a provider to protect the organization’s data and information from disruption ⏤ due either to natural disasters, human error or cyberattacks ⏤ by enabling full operational recovery using a cloud-based solution.\n\nHow does DRaaS work?\n\nDRaaS works in various ways. In some cases, a disaster recovery services vendor will leverage a small appliance installed on-premises at a client’s site. These appliances collect backup images and send backup information offsite where it can later be used to recover operations at a new location. In other cases, DRaaS solutions target continuous data replication to permit spinning up disaster recovery services in the cloud or at another location.\n\nRegardless of the data backup and synchronization strategy, most DRaaS solutions offer many common capabilities, including encrypted data transfer, offsite replication, emergency recovery and maintenance.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using DRaaS?\n\nThe benefits of using DRaaS are that organizations can integrate these cloud-based services within their larger business continuity and disaster recovery plans to properly protect systems, applications and data in a way that also fulfills their specific disaster recovery requirements.\n\nProper and effective disaster planning requires addressing numerous elements, such as system, application and data backups, safe storage of those backups, and quick recovery. DRaaS providers offer a complete smorgasbord of options to organizations of all sizes operating across all industries. These providers tailor their DRaaS solutions to an organization’s specific needs.\n\nA small advertising firm may survive if recovery operations take several days. However, a large accounting firm might need to return to regular operation in just an hour were a disaster to occur during the height of tax season.\n\nTop DRaaS providers and solutions\n\nAcronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect\n\nAcronis offers a variety of cloud-based data protection and recovery solutions. While some Acronis products, such as Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud, are designed for managed services providers to wield assisting customers, still others are built specifically for businesses and organizations.\n\nPaired together, two Acronis products provide organizations with a powerful one-two punch. Known as Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect, this DRaaS solution creates a powerful combination to both protect data and applications and enable disaster recovery.\n\nThe primary product, Acronis Cyber Protect, gives businesses potent backup and recovery software that also includes integrated cybersecurity features. Its single console simplifies managing data and endpoint protection, reducing administration overhead while identifying and resolving issues. Starting at $79 for small- and medium-size environments, the software permits making image, file and local backups. The platform permits bare metal recovery and the recovery of production systems to dissimilar hardware. It is compatible within Windows, Linux, VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V environments.\n\nAdding another Acronis solution, Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery, boosts effectiveness. The service adds a streamlined disaster recovery process in which testing failover and failback of protected data, applications and systems is both enabled and simplified.\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery add-on also enables other critical capabilities. Using the add-on, administrators can customize recovery point objectives that help ensure the most current data is recovered. In the event of a disaster, the add-on also permits recovering and running an organization’s operations directly from Acronis’ cloud server environment. Such potentialities prove critical in the event of floods, fires, tornados and other disasters.\n\nPricing depends upon a number of variables, including the number of protected machines and the amount of data being stored. Firms can test the solution for free for 30 days.\n\nContact Acronis directly at 1-781-782-9000 for more information or with questions.\n\nCarbonite Recover\n\nBoasting push-button failover, Carbonite Recover is a DRaaS offering that reduces the risks of unplanned downtime and operations interruption by securely replicating critical applications and data to the Carbonite cloud. Subsequently, an up-to-date production environment becomes available for immediate failover.\n\nUsing Carbonite’s solution, primary servers can replicate in real-time, at the individual byte level, to the DRaaS cloud (Figure A). Organizations can perform their own non-disruptive, self-service tests, and access and view failover reporting. In the event organizations need more assistance, Carbonite’s technical services team can also provide support, including for deployment, testing and recovery.\n\nFigure A\n\nThe solution works by installing a Carbonite Recovery agent on each system to be protected. Following service configuration, those systems then begin sending encrypted data continuously, and with little adverse performance impact according to the vendor, to the Carbonite cloud.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, organizations can spin up the cloud-based replicas to recover operations. Then, once an organization is ready to return to using its primary production systems, the process is essentially reversed.\n\nSupported across a variety of environments, including Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, VMware and Hyper-V, pricing is based on the number of endpoints, the amount of data and the types of assistive services the organization selects.\n\nContact Carbonite directly at 1-877-542-8637 for more information or with questions.\n\nDatto ALTO & SIRIS\n\nDatto, whose acquisition by Kaseya was announced in April 2022, provides a range of DRaaS and BCDR offerings for MSPs (Figure B).

Whether working with file servers, databases, VMs or other technologies, the offering also supports using APIs, PowerShell and the Azure command-line interface to manage and automate backup and security parameters.\n\nAzure Site Recovery fulfills the second half of the DRaaS function after backing up or replicating data: Recovery. Organizations begin by replicating Azure VMs to a different Azure region, thereby providing geographic protection from common failures and disasters. Azure Site Recovery also permits administrators to retain application availability during primary system outages thanks to automatic recovery, including from an on-premises platform to Azure or from one Azure region to another.\n\nMicrosoft Azure is available from MSPs and VARs, as well as from the vendor directly. For more information, contact Microsoft at 1-855-270-0615.\n\nNutanix Disaster Recovery\n\nSimilar to other cloud providers, Nutanix offers a variety of cloud services, from data analytics to desktops as a service to BCDR solutions. The firm’s Data Disaster Recovery platform simplifies replicating data across multiple sites to ensure and speed disaster recovery.\n\nWith always-on availability across multiple sites and geographic distancing, the DRaaS solution replicates data synchronously, thereby minimizing data loss and downtime. With the ability to continue powering business operations even when multiple sites fail simultaneously, Nutanix assists in implementing aggressive RPOs and RTOs to permit rapid recovery.\n\nBoasting centralized management and supporting the administration of both on-premises and cloud platforms, the service permits customizing BCDR plans as an organization requires. Nutanix’ DRaaS service also integrates with third-party data protection solutions to better enable granular data recovery.\n\nThe firm’s services can be purchased from resellers as well as directly from Nutanix, For more information on the company, contact Nutanix at 1-855-NUTANIX.\n\nQuorum DRaaS\n\nAvailable from partners or directly from Quorum itself, Quorum onQ claims status as a leader in the single-click instant recovery space. By automatically maintaining current critical system and application data on ready-to-run VM clones of an organization’s physical and virtual servers stored on a dedicated appliance, recovery can be simplified to a single click.\n\nBuilt on top of high-availability infrastructure, the Quorum solution supports storing backup archives and images for the long term.

The service also supports practicing recovery operations, activating continuity plans and monitoring backup and recovery tasks.\n\nThe solution includes yet other capabilities, too. Using the service, organizations can help eliminate surprises by using data stored within the ServiceNow continuity management platform to monitor for risks and identify possible gaps in recovery capabilities.\n\nOne of the persistent challenges with BCDR plans is the rate at which production environment components change. ServiceNow’s BCDR’s services assist organizations in managing such issues by permitting automation of plan maintenance with larger BCDR workflows powered by the ServiceNow platform.\n\nServiceNow’s business continuity management initiative also encourages prioritizing critical applications, services, processes and sites. Subsequently, ServiceNow’s DRaaS solutions offer compelling benefits, especially for firms that depend on ServiceNow for CRM, DevOps and other operations assistance.\n\nFor more information, contact ServiceNow using its Contact Us page.\n\nShadowProtect\n\nPlagued by a data loss event that primarily impacted MSP clients beginning in March 2022, Arcserve’s StorageCraft backup service proved prone to human error. An extended period of degraded operation, in which business’ data backups reportedly proved inaccessible, looks to have been due to mistakes made when preparing backend upgrades, according to Arcserve’s CEO.\n\nWith Arcserve working diligently to solve the problem and communicating proactively with customers and partners, the firm remains a player within the DRaaS space. The ShadowProtect brand was long previously trusted to enable both data backups and recovery.\n\nSold by partners as well as directly to businesses, StorageCraft’s ShadowProtect DRaaS boasts cross-platform coverage, including for Windows and Linux systems, physical servers and VMs. The storage-agnostic solution supports most disk-based storage technologies, including the OneXafe NAS storage format.

The move to Windows 11 was "99 percent successful," the announcement indicated.\n\nUpgrade failure numbers weren\'t described. Microsoft just indicated that some devices weren\'t upgraded and are continuing to run Windows 10 until "their next device refresh."\n\nMicrosoft Tools\n\nMicrosoft used its "rings" triage approach of upgrading smaller groups first to Windows 11, before extending the upgrade. It used own tools in the process, as follows:\n\nUpdate Compliance and Microsoft Endpoint Manager\'s endpoint analytics feature to gauge device readiness\n\nThe Windows Update for Business Deployment Service, which was said to reduce the number of policies needed for the Windows 11 deployments and allow for easy operating system rollbacks\n\nThe Windows Autopilot service for provisioning new machines built by original equipment manufacturer partners\n\nMicrosoft Power BI for tracking devices by "country and region" and Windows 11 upgrade "eligibility," and for notifying users not qualifying for an upgrade\n\n"Yammer, FAQs, Microsoft SharePoint, email, Microsoft Teams, our internal homepage, and digital signage" for communicating with employees about the upgrade.\n\nMicrosoft also let its employees check the ability to upgrade to Windows 11 via use of the PC Health Check app. However, its support teams "didn\'t get many upgrade tickets" as a result.\n\nMicrosoft claimed that this Windows 11 upgrade effort represented the "fastest deployment in company history."\n\nThe announcement did not mention using Microsoft Intune, the company\'s PC and mobile device management service for the Windows 11 deployments, but it described not using images, which is a typically touted Intune benefit.\n\n"Our success was built around several factors: far fewer app compatibility challenges than in the past, not needing to build out a plethora of disk images, and delivery processes and tools already that were greatly improved during the rollout of Windows 10," Microsoft indicated.\n\nWindows 11 Use Still Lags\n\nOf Microsoft\'s client operating systems, Windows 10 use predominates at 74.82 percent, vs. Windows 7\'s 12.11 percent and Windows 11\'s 8.45 percent, according to March 2022 information compiled by Statcounter.com. Windows 11 has stringent hardware requirements that precludes some Windows 10 machines from making a jump to Windows 11.\n\nThe Windows 11 hardware requirements enforce the use of newer processors and a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 chip for security. David Weston, vice president for OS security and enterprise at Microsoft, recently doubled down on the view that the stricter hardware upgrade requirements for Windows 11 was the right call in this Twitter post.

But one thing that stayed constant was the steady flow of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) across the tech sector.\n\nAccording to research by Global Data, global tech M&A deals had already neared $3 trillion by Q3, largely supported by the tech, media, and telecom sectors. Although nothing rivalled Xilinx’s $35 billion acquisition of Advanced Micro Devices in 2020, last year did see Intuit buy Mailchimp for $12 billion and Square splash out a princely sum — $29 billion — for Afterpay.\n\nGlobalData Global mergers and acquisitions value.\n\n[ Further reading: Biggest technology acquisitions of 2021 ]\n\nAs for whether 2022 will maintain last year’s pace, early signs seem to suggest there will be no slowing of big deals across the industry, with cybersecurity and collaboration software already proving to be hot areas.\n\nHere are the biggest enterprise technology acquisitions of 2022 so far, in reverse chronological order:\n\nApril 25: Elon Musk buys Twitter for $44B\n\nNine years after going public, and eleven days after billionaire Elon Musk first made an offer to buy Twitter, the social media network announced it would become a privately owned company once again.\n\nThe purchase price totals an eye-watering $44 billion and is includes of $21 billion of Musk’s own money, alongside debt funding from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter\'s closing stock price on April 1.\n\nDespite initially declining Musk’s offer and enacting anti-takeover measures, the board ultimately decided to accept Musk\'s offer once it saw confirmed funding for the acquisition.\n\nIn a company statement, Bret Taylor, Twitter\'s independent board chair, said: "The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\'s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter\'s stockholders.”\n\nApril 11: Kaseya buys Datto for $6.2B and takes the company private\n\nSecurity software company Kaseya has agreed to buy Datto for $6.2 billion and will take the company private again, after it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2020. Datto was founded in 2007 and provides data backup and security software, primarily to managed service providers.\n\n“This is exciting news for Kaseya’s global customers, who can expect to see more functional, innovative and integrated solutions as a result of the purchase,” said Fred Voccola, Kaseya’s CEO.\n\nApril 5: AMD acquires Pensando for $1.9B\n\nChipmaker AMD has announced the acquisition of Pensando for approximately $1.9 billion.\n\nPensado specializes in data processing unites (DPUs), which include intelligent, programmable software to support the software-defined cloud, compute, networking, storage, and security services that could be rolled out quickly to edge, colocation, or service-provider networks.\n\n“There are a wide range of use cases—such as 5G and IoT—that need to support lots of low-latency traffic,” Soni Jiandani, Pensando cofounder and chief business office told Network World last November. “We’ve taken a ground-up approach to giving enterprise customers a fully programmable system with the ability to support multiple infrastructure services without dedicated CPUs.”\n\nMarch 29: Celonis acquires Process Analytics Factory\n\nProcess mining specialist Celonis is acquiring fellow German software firm, Process Analytics Factory, for a reported $100 million.\n\nUp until now, Celonis has been focused on helping enterprises optimize processes around their ERP systems — and more recently has branched out to help them optimize their use of workflow automation platforms, too. Now it is acquiring Process Analytics Factory to improve its process mining offering and help enterprises automate with Microsoft’s Power Platform.\n\nIn October 2020 Celonis launched its Execution Management System (EMS) to visualize and design more efficient processes, and in April 2021 it formed a partnership with Microsoft to deliver process analytics through Power BI and to integrate its process improvement tools with Microsoft power Platform. Then, in October 2021, it partnered with ServiceNow to deliver process mining capabilities to the Now platform. It also has technology partnerships with Appian, Coupa, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce, Snowflake, Splunk, and a handful of other software vendors.\n\nMarch 28: HP to acquire Poly for $3.3B\n\nHP has announced it is acquiring Poly, a company that specializes in video and audio equipment, for a purchase price of $1.7 billion, with a total transaction value of $3.3 billion, including debt. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2022.\n\nThe acquisition is set to accelerate HP’s foray into the world of hybrid work, coming eight months after the company purchased remote desktop software provider Teradici.\n\nFounded in 1990 and originally named Polycom, the company was acquired by headset maker Plantronics in 2019, after which the two newly merged companies rebranded themselves as Poly. Since then, the company has focused on providing enterprise-grade collaboration products, such as meeting room speakers and cameras, webcams, headsets, and software.\n\n“The rise of the hybrid office creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the way work gets done,” said Enrique Lores, president and CEO of HP. “Combining HP and Poly creates a leading portfolio of hybrid work solutions across large and growing markets. Poly’s strong technology, complementary go-to-market, and talented team will help to drive long-term profitable growth as we continue building a stronger HP.”\n\nMarch 23: Apple acquires UK fintech startup Credit Kudos\n\nApple is acquiring the UK-based fintech startup Credit Kudos for an undisclosed amount. Credit Kudos last raised £5 million ($6.5 million) in funding in April 2020.\n\nNeither Credit Kudos or Apple could be reached to confirm the deal, which was first reported by the crypto-focused publication The Block, citing three sources close to the deal.\n\nCredit Kudos is a challenger credit bureau that uses machine learning and real-time data to build up a fuller picture of a person’s credit score, rather than traditional agencies, which typically rely on older information such as bank and utility statements to build a profile.\n\nThe firm has also benefitted from the recent wave of open banking regulations across the globe, which aim to open up consumer financial data via a set of secure application programming interfaces (APIs). Credit Kudos provides this data to clients for services such as affordability and risk assessments.\n\nIt is unclear what Apple plans to do with Credit Kudos, but the company has invested significantly in its fintech capabilities over recent years — in particular, its mobile Apple Pay wallet and its Apple Card credit card, which is currently only available in the US and was built in partnership with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMarch 8: Google buys cybersecurity company Mandiant\n\nGoogle will acquire cyberdefense and response firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion, in a move to offer an end-to-end security operations suite and advisory services from its cloud platform.\n\n“Cybersecurity is a mission, and we believe it’s one of the most important of our generation,” Mandiant CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement announcing the acquisition. "Google Cloud shares our mission-driven culture to bring security to every organization. Together, we will deliver our expertise and intelligence at scale via the Mandiant Advantage SaaS platform, as part of the Google Cloud security portfolio.”\n\nMarch 3: Snowflake buys Streamlit for $800M\n\nData cloud company Snowflake has acquired Streamlit for $800 million, enabling developers and data scientists to build apps using tools with simplified data access and governance.\n\nStreamlit’s open-source framework allows developers and data scientists to build and share data apps quickly and iteratively, without the need to be an expert in front-end development. According to Streamlit, the platform has had more than 8 million downloads and more than 1.5 million applications have been built using it.\n\n“At Snowflake, we believe in bringing together open standards and open source with industry-leading data governance and security,” Snowflake Co-Founder and President of Products Benoit Dageville said in a statement announcing the acquisition. “When Snowflake and Streamlit come together, we will be able to provide developers and data scientists with a single, powerful hub to discover and collaborate with data they can trust to build next generation data apps and shape the future of data science.”\n\nFeb. 28: Rakuten Symphony acquires Kubernetes platform Robin.io\n\nThe recently launched telco-focused arm of Japan’s Rakuten Group, Rakuten Symphony, has acquired Robin.io, a startup offering a Kubernetes platform optimized for storage and complex network applications.\n\nThe two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition. Since first launching, Robin.io has moved beyond its original focus on storage to offer a more full-featured Kubernetes platform, providing large telcos with ways of automating 5G services applications on Kubernetes and orchestrating private 5G and LTE deployments.\n\n“Robin.io’s technology innovations over the last several years will now get a much bigger canvas to lead the vision for cloud-native transformation for the industry. Our vision to deliver simple to use, easy to deploy hyperscale automation is very well aligned,” said Robin.io CEO Partha Seetala.\n\nFeb. 24: Cloudflare acquires security startup Area 1 Security\n\nCloudflare announced plans to acquire Area 1 Security for around $126 million, using both cash and stock to fund the acquisition.\n\nCloudflare has its own suite of zero-trust security products designed to prevent data loss, malware and phishing attacks, even when employees aren’t using their office network or a VPN. This deal will see the company add email security to this portfolio.\n\nArea 1 Security has developed a product that stops phishing attacks sent via email before they reach an inbox. The company claims to have blocked more than 40 million phishing attempts in 2021 alone.\n\nCloudflare cCo-founder and CEO Matthew Prince said in a statement: “To us, the future of Zero Trust includes an integrated, one-click approach to securing all of an organization’s applications, including its most ubiquitous cloud application, email. Together, we expect we’ll be delivering the fastest, most effective, and most reliable email security on the market.”\n\nFeb. 15: Intel to acquire Tower Semiconductor\n\nIntel announced plans to acquire Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 billion, giving it access to more specialized production as it looks to take advantage of growing demand for semiconductors. The deal has been approved by both company boards, but is expected to take as long as 12 months to move through the normal regulatory channels.\n\nIntel announced last year that it was planning to enter the foundry market to produce chips designed by their customers. Tower has been investing in multiple locations in recent years to boost capacity for 200- and 300-millimeter chips. It serves "fabless" companies, who design chips but outsource manufacturing, and integrated device manufacturers.\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger sees the move as a good fit for the company’s vision. “Tower’s specialty technology portfolio, geographic reach, deep customer relationships and services-first operations will help scale Intel’s foundry services and advance our goal of becoming a major provider of foundry capacity globally,” he said in a statement.\n\nFeb. 15: Akamai acquires Linode for $900M\n\nAkamai has entered into an agreement to acquire Linode, an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform provider, for approximately $900 million. Akamai reportedly expects Linode to add about $100 million in revenue for FY22.\n\nFounded in 2003, Linode has positioned itself as an IaaS alternative to public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Unlike many of its competitors, Linode says it had not raised outside funding, boasting it “has successfully run a profitable business since [its] inception.”\n\n“The opportunity to combine Linode’s developer-friendly cloud computing capabilities with Akamai’s market-leading edge platform and security services is transformational for Akamai,” Akamai CEO and co-founder Tom Leighton said in a statement. “Akamai has been a pioneer in the edge computing business for over 20 years, and today we are excited to begin a new chapter in our evolution by creating a unique cloud platform to build, run and secure applications from the cloud to the edge.”\n\nJan 31: Citrix to be acquired by private equity firms for $16.5B\n\nCloud computing and virtualization company Citrix is being acquired by private equity firms Vista Equity Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital for $16.5 billion. It’s been reported that Vista plans to combine Citrix with Tibco, which it acquired in 2014 for $4.3 billion.\n\nThe all-cash deal will see the publicly traded Citrix go private and will include the assumption of Citrix’s debt, the companies said.', 'image': 'https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/01/big-data_merger-and-acquisition_big-business_smb-100747394-large.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85,70', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:00'}

Unfortunately, the Medic Agent itself can cause problems by having high RAM, high CPU, and high disk usage. Luckily, the WaaS MedicAgent can be disabled completely.\n\nWhat Is WaaSMedicAgent.exe?\n\nNo software is perfect — things go wrong, and files break, including Windows Updates (especially Windows Updates). Windows as a Service Medic Agent (WaaSMedicAgent) was introduced in Windows 10 to “Enable remediation and protection of Windows Update components.” In other words, it fixes problems with Windows Update that might prevent your PC from updating.\n\nThis process is supposed to run when Windows encounters a problem with an update. Unfortunately, the Medic Agent itself has been known to cause problems. In some cases, it bogs down PCs for hours by maxing out CPUs, causing extremely high RAM usage, and causing high disk usage.\n\nIs It Malware?\n\nWaaSMedicAgent.exe is a legitimate part of Windows 10 and Windows 11. It has occasionally caused problems that resemble malicious behavior, but it isn’t malware. Of course, it is relatively common for malware authors to try to disguise malware as legitimate applications and services. You can run a scan with Microsoft Defender and Malwarebytes’ Antivirus to rule out the possibility.\n\nHow to Disable WaaSMedicAgent\n\nThough it can be annoying, you should seriously consider whether or not you want to stop the executable from running and disable the service. Windows Update will still function even if Medic Agent is disabled, but it might not be able to recover from an error if one occurs during an update.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat said, if you want to disable WaaSMedicAgent, here are a few ways you can do it.\n\nDelay Your Updates\n\nWaaSMedicAgent should only be activated if Windows Update encounters an issue. Pausing Windows 10 or Windows 11 updates can temporarily stop WaaSMedicAgent from using excessive amounts of RAM, maxing out your disk usage, utilizing your CPU, and otherwise bogging down your PC. It won’t permanently solve any of your problems, though.\n\nIf you just need to get your system working for a bit pausing updates is a good option. Just remember to let it run later so it can try to fix whatever error occurred.\n\nDisable WaaSMedicAgent Using RegEdit\n\nWaaSMedicAgent is the Windows Service that is associated with WaaSMedicAgent.exe — if you want to stop the executable from running, you need to disable the service as well. Windows will not allow you to disable the service from the Services app, but you can disable it using the Registry Editor (RegEdit). As always, be careful editing the Windows Registry. Deleting a key accidentally — or even changing a value — can cause serious problems for computers, and major headaches for humans.\n\nRELATED: Learning to Use the Registry Editor Like a Pro\n\nFirst, you need to launch RegEdit. Click the Start button, type “regedit” into the search bar, and then hit Enter or click “Open.”\n\nNavigate to the following path in the Registry Editor window, or copy-paste the following line into its address bar and press Enter:\n\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WaaSMedicSvc\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWaaSMedicService is the name of the registry key. You’ll see it in the left pane. Registry keys are a bit like folders. They can contain subkeys, which are like subfolders, and properties, which are like files.\n\nEvery registry key found within “Services” will have a property named “Start” that determines when or why the service will be launched.\n\nStart can take a few different values:\n\n2 is “Automatic”\n\n3 is “Manual”\n\n4 is “Disabled”\n\nDouble-click the “Start” property in the right pane and change the value to 4, and then click “Ok.”\n\nTip: If you’ve used the Services app before, you might have noticed that some services are Automatic, but are specifically designed to start “Delayed.” The property that sets “Delayed” is named “DelayedAutoStart”. A value of 1 enables delayed automatic start, while 0 disables delayed automatic start.\n\nDisable Using Our Registry Keys\n\nIf you don’t want to mess with the registry yourself, there are two registry keys attached to this article. One is named “Disable_WaaSMedicSvc.reg” and will disable WaasMedicSvc (and WaaSMedicAgent.exe) completely. The other REG file is named “ReEnabled_WaaSMedicSvc.reg” and will return the service to its default value.\n\nWaaSMedic_Registry_Keys\n\nJust download the zip file, extract the contents anywhere, and double-click “Disable_WaaSMedicSvc.reg.” You’ll receive a warning about the dangers of applying registry keys — hit “Yes.”\n\nKeep in mind that other components of Windows Update will probably re-enable the Medic Service at some point in time in the future. If you haven’t fixed the issue with Windows Update, you might suddenly find the service set to manual and WaaSMedicAgent.exe running unexpectedly. You can always just kick the can down the road and disable the service again, but you shouldn’t. If you have the time, let the Medic Agent run, or try to fix Windows Update manually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe registry key we provided might be helpful if you need to disable WaaSMedicSvc repeatedly since you only need to double-click it to set the service to “Disabled” again.', 'image': 'https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-11-and-10.png?height=200p&trim=2,2,2,2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:59'}

For certain services that's true but a crop of cheaper meal kit delivery services has significantly closed the gap. That's especially true considering the current inflation woes and rising cost of groceries.\n\nSo then, how much more expensive are meal kits versus buying the necessary groceries? I was wondering that very thing and with the cheapest meal kits clocking in at just $5 per serving, I had an inkling it would be pretty close. In calculating the grocery cost for two recipes from my favorite budget-friendly meal kit service, , it turns out just a measly buck or two separates the two mealtime approaches, and the perception of meal kits as pricey date-splurge may be more myth than reality in 2022.\n\nMeal kit vs. grocery store\n\nEveryPlate (meals for 2) EveryPlate (meals for 4) Groceries bought at the store Cost per serving $7.39 $6.50 $5.26\n\nSo how did I get these numbers?\n\nTo calculate the cost of meal kits when compared to buying the groceries, I took two EveryPlate recipes and priced out the ingredients. To keep things consistent I used the cheapest results that populated on , a popular online grocery delivery service here in the Northeast.\n\nSince spices are generally sold in 1- or 2-ounce bottles, I divided the cost by 20 since each bottle of spices contains roughly 20 servings. The same goes for ingredients like sour cream and soy sauce that are also sold in larger quantities. I divided the total cost by roughly how much you'd need to execute each recipe.\n\nRead more: Best Cheap Meal Delivery Services in 2022\n\nHow much does a meal kit service like EveryPlate cost?\n\nEveryPlate is one of the cheapest meal kit services, with clocking in at $5 a serving. For a meal plan for two people and three meals per week, it's slightly more at $5.89 a serving. I used the to compare with the cost of buying your own groceries. There's also a $9 flat shipping cost which I divided by the three meals. When it's all said and done, EveryPlate will cost you $7.39 a serving.\n\nEveryPlate\n\nHow much meal kits would cost if you bought the groceries\n\nBelow is a breakdown of what two would cost if you bought the groceries yourself. These prices were calculated from in early April of 2022. I didn't include the delivery fees for a grocery service or the cost of gas required to get yourself to and from the store. It's also worth noting that the grocery prices listed below are significantly lower than what I find at my local markets in Brooklyn.\n\nSmothered pork chops with home fries and carrots (2 servings)\n\nCarrots (12 ounces): $1.50\n\nFive Yukon gold potatoes: $1.50\n\nOne yellow onion: $0.90\n\n\n\nTwo scallions: $0.50\n\n\n\nTwo 5-ounce pork chops: $4.93\n\n\n\nOne packet of chicken stock concentrate: $0.60\n\n\n\nCayenne pepper: $0.20\n\n\n\nSour cream (2 ounces): $1.50\n\n\n\nTotal: $11.13\n\nCost per serving: $5.56\n\nEveryPlate\n\nCherry meatballs with zucchini and garlic mashed potatoes (2 servings)\n\nFive Yukon gold potatoes: $1.60\n\nWhite bread (one slice): $0.50\n\nOne zucchini: $1.50\n\nGround beef (8 ounces): $3.50\n\nCherry jam (1 ounce): $0.85\n\nGarlic powder: $0.10\n\nSour cream (2 ounces): $1.50\n\nSoy sauce (1 ounce): $0.50\n\nTotal: $10.05\n\nCost per serving: $5.02\n\nDavid Watsky/CNET\n\nHow much more is a meal kit than buying groceries?\n\nWhen compared to the cost of buying all the necessary groceries at the store, EveryPlate clocks in at around $2 more per serving. If you were to pick one of the plans with servings for four, it would be more like $1 more. So, it's pretty much a wash.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's convenience you're paying a little extra for. But if you choose a budget-friendly service such as EveryPlate or Dinnerly, that little extra turns out to be barely anything at all.\n\nRead more: EveryPlate Review: See How the Cheapest Meal Kit Service Holds Up in a Test\n\nWhat about the environmental cost, packaging and waste?\n\nThere's no doubt that meal kit services use more plastic than if you buy your own groceries. That said, the cheaper services have found ways to cut costs. In many cases, that means using less packaging.\n\nShelby Brown/CNET\n\nEveryPlate, for instance, is one of the most eco-friendly services I've tried. The company puts all its produce and other ingredients in a single cardboard box, whereas others individually package each ingredient, creating more waste. Most of the packaging, including the cooler box and ice packs are curbside recyclable.\n\nOn the flip side, since meal kits generally give you exactly what you need for each meal and no more, you're less likely to have food waste. Who hasn't thrown out those last few ounces from a tub of sour cream or a couple of scallions you couldn't find a use for before they wilted away?\n\nWhat about other meal kit services?\n\nEveryPlate is the cheapest meal kit service, along with The most expensive outfits -- Sunbasket, Green Chef, Martha Stewart and Marley Spoon and Blue Apron -- cost closer to $10 or $13 a serving. The added cost is generally due to premium ingredients like grass-fed beef and organic produce. With those, you're going to find a bigger delta between the meal kit cost and what it would cost to make the meal at home. Services like HelloFresh and Home Chef fall somewhere in the middle with meal kits ranging from around $8 and $10 a serving.\n\nNot interested in cooking at all?

Some services see it as a chance to encourage upgrades or just as free advertising for the paid service. Others, however, host third-party ads, which means you may be targeted based on your browsing habits—potentially killing the point of using a VPN in the first place—while others might be analyzing the websites you visit in the name of optimization or big data collection.\n\nIf you plan on using a VPN long term it’s a good idea to pay for the privilege. That way you get more server locations, more simultaneous device connections, and sometimes even better speeds. Restrictions on free services vary by service provider, but there are always restrictions of some kind.\n\nNevertheless, free VPNs are good if you just want to try out a service for a while, or if you only need a VPN every now and then. If you’re looking for a VPN for Windows here are our top recommendations.\n\nIf and when you decide to upgrade to full-fledged paid service, check out our comprehensive roundup of the best VPN services—our recommendations vary from this list once money is on the line.\n\n1. ProtonVPN – Best overall Best Prices Today: When it comes to Windows and free VPNs you can’t beat ProtonVPN. The free version only allows one device connection at a time per account, but that’s all you need if Windows is your focus. ProtonVPN’s speeds are second best in our tests of the paid services, but ProtonVPN does limit free account speeds somewhat to what it calls “Medium speed.” These speeds were entirely acceptable, however, for all the various things you might want to do such as video streaming or regular web browsing. Note, however, that explicit Netflix support is not part of the free offering. We also like ProtonVPN’s app design, which can be expanded to a larger version with an interactive map. Alternatively, it can be reduced to something more like a smartphone app. ProtonVPN requires an email address and password to use the free version and users are limited to three country choices. Read our full ProtonVPN review 2. Windscribe – Best for multiple devices Windscribe is the value choice if you want a lot of extra features and fewer limitations than other free services with one big exception. Namely, that you only get 10GB worth of data per month. That is not enough for a lot of video streaming, but it’s fine for everything else. As a trade-off there are no device limits and you get 10 location choices, which is more than most free services. The Windscribe app is also pretty straightforward Windscribe requires you to sign up with an email address. Read our full Windscribe Pro review 3. Hide.me – Also recommended Best Prices Today: Hide.me is a mix of both ProtonVPN and Windscribe. Similar to Windscribe you only get 10GB per month with the free version, and like ProtonVPN you only get one device at a time. Country choices are narrowed down to four with two regions in the U.S. for a total of five location options. Read our full Hide.me review\n\nWhat to look for in a free VPN on Windows\n\nWhen you’re shopping for a free service for Windows the criteria are similar to what you’d consider for a general free VPN. You want a service that is not displaying third-party ads or harvesting your browsing habits. Privacy is key with VPNs and even on a free one there’s no reason to compromise.\n\nNext, you can consider what’s important to you such as ease of use with an interface you understand, speeds, and country choices. That last point is going to be fairly restricted when going free, because that’s standard practice for free VPNs. Nevertheless, if you want a U.S. connection, for example, most free services will offer that.\n\nIf you’re hoping to use Netflix overseas with a free VPN you may be out of luck. Sometimes it might work on a regular U.S. server, but for the most part Netflix streaming requires specialty servers provided as part of a premium package. Other streaming services, however, may not be as picky as Netflix is when it comes to detecting VPN connections.\n\nHow we test VPNs\n\nAll VPNs tested on Windows go through a three-day process. Each day we test the VPN speeds in five different countries plus the base speed without a VPN connection. Each country is tested three times per day taking the average.\n\nWhen the testing is done we take the average of the base speed, and the overall global average of the VPN speeds. Then we represent the drop from the base speed as a percentage. The idea is to show how generally good a VPN is across all locations, and not just Europe or the United States. We also don’t show specific megabytes-per-second speed since those speeds can vary greatly, but how much dip to expect as a percentage can be more generalized.\n\nFree VPNs can sometimes hamper the speeds compared to what you see on free VPNs; however, that’s not as much of a concern here as all the VPNs we recommend have good speeds regardless.\n\nFinding a good free VPN for Windows is fairly simple. It all depends on whether you prioritize features like unlimited data usage, extra features, or a higher number of country options.', 'image': 'https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/free-gettyimages-1056445318-100825073-orig-100915024-orig-1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:12'}

Popular names like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have gotten a lot of attention from celebrities and public figures. However, the expansion of these original meme coins has slowed down, making room for more intriguing projects. Investors in this dog-themed space are on the hunt for the next meme coin cryptocurrency to explode in the coming weeks.\n\nWe’ve curated a list of some promising meme cryptocurrencies that you should consider adding to your portfolio.\n\n1. Lucky Block (LBLOCK)\n\nOur top recommendation for the next meme coin cryptocurrency to explode is Lucky Block. Although LBLOCK is not a meme coin, it has the potential to explode given its strong fundamentals.\n\nAt press time, LBLOCK trades at $0.001697, a drop of 6.91% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLucky Block, a cutting-edge game-centric crypto platform, is hosted on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. The platform aims to promote gaming transparency and fairness by developing a gaming system in which all participants have a higher chance of winning while simultaneously contributing to the community and giving token holders a smart investment strategy.\n\nToken holders can choose to participate in the daily jackpot by locking in their tokens. Then, when the game draw is held, one person wins 70% of the jackpot, 10% is to be donated to charity, 10% is spent on marketing, and 10% is dispersed to all LBLOCK holders by the proportion of tokens they own.\n\nLucky Block shortens the time between draws and allows multiple draws per day, providing players more opportunities to win while cutting gaming costs. Regardless of the size of the jackpot prize, the use of distributed ledger technology allows for faster payouts and thorough documentation and verification.\n\nDillian ‘Bodysnatcher’ Whyte helped Lucky Block become a household name after the game-centric blockchain sponsored him to fight against Tyson Fury. Despite being knocked out by the best heavyweight boxer in the world, Dillian fought hard and tenaciously throughout Saturday night’s bout against Tyson Fury.\n\nAfter information spread that Lucky Block had paid for Dillian to be flown to his training camp in Portugal by private jet, there was a 700% increase in LBLOCK token holders in less than a week.\n\n2. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDogecoin (DOGE), the fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, is second on our list of the next meme coin cryptocurrency to explode.\n\nDOGE’s price is currently trading at $0.1616, a rise of 29.65% in the last 24 hours. The meme-coin has risen by 18.32% in the past 7 days.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) was created as a humorous alternative to existing cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin that was created with a limited quantity Dogecoin is supposed to be abundant, with no cap on the total amount and 10,000 new coins produced every minute.\n\nAlthough each coin is only worth a few cents, DOGE has become one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies in market capitalisation, topping $50 billion in 2021.\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, announced that users can purchase some Tesla items using Dogecoin. The Cyberquad for Kids (12,020 doge, about $2,320), the Giga Texas Belt Buckle (835 doge, around $161), and the Cyberwhistle (300 doge, approximately $58) are some of the things that you can purchase with meme-based money.\n\nMusk loves Dogecoin. He revealed on Twitter that the firm would evaluate the cryptocurrency payment option. Tesla has yet to announce whether or not it will accept Dogecoin as a means of payment for its vehicles.\n\n3. Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nOur next meme coin cryptocurrency to explode is Shiba Inu. At press time, SHIB trades at $0.000024, a rise of 7.87% in the last 24 hours.\n\nSHIB is a token that aims to be an Ethereum-compatible Dogecoin substitute. The Shiba Inu ecosystem also supports projects like the NFT art incubator and Shibaswap, a decentralised exchange.\n\nJust like DOGE, SHIB is designed to be abundant; it has a one quadrillion coin initial circulating supply.\n\nThe Shiba Inu website enables dog-inspired artists worldwide to participate in the “creative Shiba movement” by introducing their Shiba Inu community to the NFT market. Shiba Inu has also launched an Amazon Smile campaign to raise funds for the Shiba Inu Rescue Association, which rescues real-life Shiba Inu dogs.\n\nAMC Theatres, the world’s largest movie theatre chain, now accepts Shiba Inu payments through their mobile app.\n\nNote that AMC Theatres has become increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins, since it was named a meme stock in early 2021. CEO Adam Aron announced that the company’s mobile app accepts payments in Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and other cryptocurrencies. In addition, users may spend SHIB on tickets, concessions, and gift cards, thanks to AMC’s connection with cryptocurrency payments service BitPay.\n\n4. Kishu Inu (KISHU)\n\nKishu Inu is our next meme coin cryptocurrency to explode. At press time, Kishu Inu trades at $0.000000001288, a rise of 7.86% in the last 24 hours. Conversely, the meme coin price has fallen by 11.44% in the past 7 days.\n\nThe digital asset is a meme cryptocurrency focused on dogs that have chosen the ‘Kishu’ canine breed as its symbol. Kishu Inu is a decentralised transactional network with a community focus; the community makes all choices. The project intends to mainstream non-fungible tokens, decentralised finance (DeFi), and participation rewards, among other next-generation concepts.\n\nKishu Inu’s objective is to take meme coins to the next level. The team wants to make the project more than a joke or a meme and, most importantly, endow KISHU with the characteristics of an actual long-term currency.\n\nMEXC Global, a leading spot and derivatives exchange, recently announced that Kishu Inu (KISHU) had been added to the Innovation Zone under the KISHU/USDT trading pair.\n\n5. Floki Inu (FLOKI)\n\nRounding off our list of 5 next meme coin cryptocurrency to explode is Floki Inu. The digital asset currently trades at $0.000023, up 15.48% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFloki Inu (FLOKI) is a dog-themed meme coin that calls itself a “movement” rather than a meme coin. It’s a cryptocurrency that Shiba Inu (SHIB) fans and community members created. Shiba Inu inspired the coin’s design.\n\nFLOKI aims to distinguish itself from other meme currencies by combining memes with utility. The long-term goal of the Floki Inu developers is to create an autonomous and decentralized ecosystem that includes strategic alliances, token utility development, and Floki Inu brand use cases via NFTs, games, and decentralized finance features.\n\nFloki Inu has launched an aggressive marketing effort in London, pasting advertisements across the city’s train stations and on its renowned red buses. The digital asset recently revealed the new campaign in a blog post, stating that “the people’s cryptocurrency” will begin advertising on the sides of 100 buses and on 203 posters in the city’s subway stations on Monday, April 25.\n\nIn addition, the most widely awaited play-to-earn game (Valhalla) is under development for a potential release this year.\n\nRead more:', 'image': 'https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ezgif.com-gif-maker.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:52'}

All Rights Reserved2022-04-26\n\nFN Media Group Presents USA News Group News Commentary\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C., April 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News Group – Bitcoin (BTC) or Dogecoin (DOGE)? Which cryptocurrency will prevail and be embraced as the "currency of the internet and the people"? This question recently caused a brief but intense spat between a pair of Silicon Valley giants: Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) and CEO of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD). Dogecoin has surged over the last two years in popularity and mindshare, to knock at the door of #2 cryptocurrency Ethereum. Soon after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk began making a serious play to acquire Twitter, DOGE prices shifted, causing Forbes to infer Dogecoin as a \'Proxy for Twitter Stock\'. As the debate rages onward, cryptomining specialists have benefitted such as Neptune Digital Assets Corp. (TSXV:NDA) (OTC:NPPTF), and Hello Pal International Inc. (CSE:HP) (OTCQB:HLLPF) which recently combine its crypto mining capabilities with its successful video livestreaming and matching businesses.\n\nThe newly launched DogeChat and DoggeChat apps from Hello Pal International Inc. (CSE:HP) (OTCQB:HLLPF) are set to allow users to match and/or video chat with other individual users from across the globe. When a connection is made, 1-on-1 video calls will generate revenues on a per-minute basis, paid for by the call\'s initiator to the call\'s receiver—now with the option to pay in crypto, which Hello Pal also is in the business of mining.\n\n"We expect these apps to be very synergistic to our current livestreaming and crypto-mining operations," said KL Wong, Founder and Chairman of Hello Pal. "They will not only bring into our existing ecosystem new users from different markets, but also allow us to start implementing our goal to make the use of cryptocurrency more widespread in the world, starting with our users."\n\nWhere DogeChat payments will be made in DOGE and other cryptocurrencies, DoggeChat payments will be in fiat currencies made through Apple Pay and Google Pay. First to launch will be DoggeChat, before DogeChat is launched at a later date, using the same user pool. However, regular users of DoggeChat will be incentivized in various ways to switch to DogeChat.\n\nHello Pal made history back in May 2021 by becoming the market\'s first listed company focused on DOGE mining. Reaction to the announcement was swift, causing a surge in traffic so heavy it temporarily caused a website outage.\n\nBoth the DoggeChat and DogeChat launches represent Hello Pal\'s market expansion into the burgeoning 1-on-1 video chatting space, as well as its foray into the North American market.\n\nMore significantly, it also represents their plan to start incorporating cryptocurrency payments into their social and livestreaming businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of revenues from cryptocurrency mining, Hello Pal and Neptune Digital Assets Corp. (TSXV:NDA) (OTC:NPPTF) have similar market caps and both recently reported strong revenues from their operations.\n\nChina\n\n, was still transitioning its mining operations out of, while increasing its mining assets and improving upon its crypto-mining operations infrastructure.\n\n"Our livestreaming operations continue to deliver strong operating results as we continue to diversify outside of China," said KL Wong. "With our focus on cryptocurrency mining operations, we anticipate that revenue and profit will continue in an upward trend."\n\nWhereas Hello Pal focuses its mining on DOGE, Neptune Digital Assets focuses more on BTC.\n\nDuring Q1 2022, Neptune Digital Assets set a fiscal quarter record with C$13 million in comprehensive income, derived from not only mining, but staking and DeFi earnings and crypto fund investment as well.\n\n"We hope to see the general crypto space grow as we move forward into 2022 and our Bitcoin mining, staking, and DeFi earnings to increase accordingly as we grow those arms of the business," stated Cale Moodie, Neptune CEO. "We anticipate another 53 petahash of mining capacity to come online in Q2 thus growing our Bitcoin earnings. We are staying true to our diversified model and will continue to manage our risk while maximizing our earnings across the board."\n\nWhich brings things back to the feud on Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) between Jack Dorsey CEO of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD).\n\nTenev began the conversation, positing in a Tweet: "Can #Doge truly be the future currency of the internet and the people? As we added the ability to send/receive DOGE on Robinhood, I\'ve been thinking about what that would take."\n\nHe went on to claim that Dogecoin could outperform Visa with respect to transaction speedsd, and that the crypto coin\'s transaction speeds would eventually surpass the credit card giant\'s current 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) capabilities.\n\n"Doge would need to be able to significantly outperform Visa, which entails increasing throughput by at least 10000x," wrote Tenev.\n\nWhile there was plenty of support for Tenev\'s musings, others on Twitter began to push back, including the social media platform\'s co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, with pointed barbs that reflected some of the audience\'s skepticism due to Robinhood\'s more recent dependence on DOGE for its revenue and profits.\n\nDorsey responded to Tenev\'s final tweet with a snarky, "u thirsty?", to which Tenev fired back with "U mad?"\n\nNot leaving it alone, Dorsey replied, "nah I\'m good I don\'t use Robinhood."\n\nTenev cleverly got the final word, capitalizing on an opportunity for Robinhood plug, replying "you would pay less for your bitcoin if you did!"\n\nTwitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) itself isn\'t playing a spectator in the cryptocurrency scene, by working with online payments firm Stripe to become the first company to integrate a new payment method that makes payouts in crypto through the stablecoin USDC. Beginning right away, Twitter will let a certain number of creators receive their earnings from its paid Ticketed Spaces and Super Follows features in USDC.\n\nBlock Inc. (NYSE:SQ) CEO Dorsey has gone all in on Bitcoin, with his departure from Twitter leading Bloomberg\'s Businessweek to claim his intention is become Bitcoin\'s "Spiritual Leader."\n\nHis company is set to work with cryptocurrency storage company Blockstream to construct a solar-powered BTC mining facility in Texas. The 3.8-megawatt (MW) facility will be outfitted with Tesla\'s solar photovoltaic cell array and a 12 MWh Megapack.\n\nAs some were criticizing Tenev for being biased in his support of DOGE, the seemingly critical anti-Dogecoin and anti-Ethereum statements of Dorsey while being hyper-focused on BTC could also be seen as biased.\n\nFor more information go to: https://usanewsgroup.com/2020/11/16/live-streaming-is-taking-the-market-by-storm/\n\nArticle Source:\n\nUSA News Group\n\nhttp://USAnewsgroup.com\n\ninfo@usanewsgroup.com\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nNothing in this publication should be considered as personalized financial advice.

"The topline exploded higher last year, and the bottom line is set to swing in our favor sharply as we get past our major fixed costs."\n\nFinancial Performance Highlights for the Twelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2021\n\nRevenues came in at $960k, up 1,643% on a year-over-year basis\n\nCash increased 540% year over year to more than $542k\n\nTotal assets increased 5,965% year over year to $10.8 million\n\nNet Operating Loss shrunk year-over-year from ($8.3M) to ($3.4M)\n\nTotal Net Income was $3.55M, improving from a loss of ($26M) in 2020\n\nOperational Highlights for the Twelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2021\n\nChanged Company name and stock symbol\n\nEngaged critical partnerships to drive innovative hybrid mining/hosting model\n\nSuccessfully transitioned self-mining facility from Pennsylvania to Southeastern U.S. location\n\nSet up 200-MW project in Gaffney, South Carolina, for follow-on deployment of first 20 MW next-gen POD 5 containers\n\nSurpassed milestones to receive additional 150 Bitmain S19 95TH/s miners as part of Minerset deal\n\nSignificantly expanded equipment, property, and power foundation for mining/hosting model, driving total assets up by nearly 6,000%\n\nSet to target Nasdaq listing in 2022\n\nManagement sees 2021 as a foundational year of investment in capital, equipment, relationships, and power to drive significant financial performance in 2022 and the years ahead. Last year, the Company put in place several agreements with the potential to create enormous shareholder value over a long-term time horizon, including the Company\'s hosting agreements, which guarantee significant steady cash flows irrespective of changes in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Company also streamlined its operational footprint by geographically consolidating operations into its Southeast U.S. site, while expanding its self-mining foundation by key equipment and asset acquisitions.\n\nThe Company\'s name and stock symbol change was also important to better align public perception and organizational identity. And its substantial growth in assets, revenues, and operational scale over the past 18 months now provide the Company and its shareholders with the basis to begin exploring the potential for a coming uplist onto a major national stock exchange.\n\nPierce added, "2021 was a year of critical investments that are set to start paying this year and over coming years. And, given our hybrid model, we aren\'t dependent upon the day to day oscillations in the price of Bitcoin. Phase Two implementation is next up!"\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout BlockQuarry\n\nBlockQuarry focuses on cryptocurrency mine hosting and self-mining operations at a leased property located in Gaffney, South Carolina.

(TSXV:NDA) (OTC:NPPTF) have similar market caps and both recently reported strong revenues from their operations.\nMIQ has been paid a fee for Hello Pal International Inc. advertising and digital media from the company directly.\nThe owner/operator of MIQ own shares of Hello Pal International Inc. which were purchased as a part of a private placement.', 'channel': 'baystreet.ca', 'text': 'USA News Group – Bitcoin (BTC) or Dogecoin (DOGE)? Which cryptocurrency will prevail and be embraced as the “currency of the internet and the people”? This question recently caused a brief but intense spat between a pair of Silicon Valley giants: Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) and CEO of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD). Dogecoin has surged over the last two years in popularity and mindshare, to knock at the door of #2 cryptocurrency Ethereum. Soon after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk began making a serious play to acquire Twitter, DOGE prices shifted, causing Forbes to infer Dogecoin as a ‘Proxy for Twitter Stock’. As the debate rages onward, cryptomining specialists have benefitted such as Neptune Digital Assets Corp. (TSXV:NDA) (OTC:NPPTF), and Hello Pal International Inc. (CSE:HP) (OTC:HLLPF) which recently combine its crypto mining capabilities with its successful video livestreaming and matching businesses.\n\nThe newly launched DogeChat and DoggeChat apps from Hello Pal International Inc. (CSE:HP) (OTC:HLLPF) are set to allow users to match and/or video chat with other individual users from across the globe. When a connection is made, 1-on-1 video calls will generate revenues on a per-minute basis, paid for by the call’s initiator to the call’s receiver—now with the option to pay in crypto, which Hello Pal also is in the business of mining.\n\n"We expect these apps to be very synergistic to our current livestreaming and crypto-mining operations," said KL Wong, Founder and Chairman of Hello Pal. "They will not only bring into our existing ecosystem new users from different markets, but also allow us to start implementing our goal to make the use of cryptocurrency more widespread in the world, starting with our users."\n\nWhere DogeChat payments will be made in DOGE and other cryptocurrencies, DoggeChat payments will be in fiat currencies made through Apple Pay and Google Pay. First to launch will be DoggeChat, before DogeChat is launched at a later date, using the same user pool. However,\n\nregular users of DoggeChat will be incentivized in various ways to switch to DogeChat.\n\nHello Pal made history back in May 2021 by becoming the market’s first listed company focused on DOGE mining. Reaction to the announcement was swift, causing a surge in traffic so heavy it temporarily caused a website outage.\n\nBoth the DoggeChat and DogeChat launches represent Hello Pal’s market expansion into the burgeoning 1-on-1 video chatting space, as well as its foray into the North American market.\n\nMore significantly, it also represents their plan to start incorporating cryptocurrency payments into their social and livestreaming businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of revenues from cryptocurrency mining, Hello Pal and Neptune Digital Assets Corp. (TSXV:NDA) (OTC:NPPTF) have similar market caps and both recently reported strong revenues from their operations.\n\nBack in February Hello Pal, was still transitioning its mining operations out of China, while increasing its mining assets and improving upon its crypto-mining operations infrastructure.\n\n"Our livestreaming operations continue to deliver strong operating results as we continue to diversify outside of China,” said KL Wong. “With our focus on cryptocurrency mining operations, we anticipate that revenue and profit will continue in an upward trend.”\n\nWhereas Hello Pal focuses its mining on DOGE, Neptune Digital Assets focuses more on BTC.\n\nDuring Q1 2022, Neptune Digital Assets set a fiscal quarter record with C$13 million in comprehensive income, derived from not only mining, but staking and DeFi earnings and crypto fund investment as well.\n\n"We hope to see the general crypto space grow as we move forward into 2022 and our Bitcoin mining, staking, and DeFi earnings to increase accordingly as we grow those arms of the business," stated Cale Moodie, Neptune CEO. "We anticipate another 53 petahash of mining capacity to come online in Q2 thus growing our Bitcoin earnings. We are staying true to our diversified model and will continue to manage our risk while maximizing our earnings across the board."\n\nWhich brings things back to the feud on Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) between Jack Dorsey CEO of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD).\n\nTenev began the conversation, positing in a Tweet: “Can #Doge truly be the future currency of the internet and the people? As we added the ability to send/receive DOGE on Robinhood, I\'ve been thinking about what that would take."\n\nHe went on to claim that Dogecoin could outperform Visa with respect to transaction speedsd, and that the crypto coin’s transaction speeds would eventually surpass the credit card giant’s current 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) capabilities.\n\n"Doge would need to be able to significantly outperform Visa, which entails increasing throughput by at least 10000x," wrote Tenev.\n\nWhile there was plenty of support for Tenev’s musings, others on Twitter began to push back, including the social media platform’s co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, with pointed barbs that reflected some of the audience’s skepticism due to Robinhood’s more recent dependence on DOGE for its revenue and profits.\n\nDorsey responded to Tenev’s final tweet with a snarky, "u thirsty?", to which Tenev fired back with “U mad?”\n\nNot leaving it alone, Dorsey replied, “nah I’m good I don’t use Robinhood.”\n\nTenev cleverly got the final word, capitalizing on an opportunity for Robinhood plug, replying “you would pay less for your bitcoin if you did!”\n\nTwitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) itself isn’t playing a spectator in the cryptocurrency scene, by working with online payments firm Stripe to become the first company to integrate a new payment method that makes payouts in crypto through the stablecoin USDC. Beginning right away, Twitter will let a certain number of creators receive their earnings from its paid Ticketed Spaces and Super Follows features in USDC.\n\nBlock Inc. (NYSE:SQ) CEO Dorsey has gone all in on Bitcoin, with his departure from Twitter leading Bloomberg’s Businessweek to claim his intention is become Bitcoin’s “Spiritual Leader.”\n\nHis company is set to work with cryptocurrency storage company Blockstream to construct a solar-powered BTC mining facility in Texas. The 3.8-megawatt (MW) facility will be outfitted with Tesla’s solar photovoltaic cell array and a 12 MWh Megapack.\n\nAs some were criticizing Tenev for being biased in his support of DOGE, the seemingly critical anti-Dogecoin and anti-Ethereum statements of Dorsey while being hyper-focused on BTC could also be seen as biased.\n\nArticle Source: https://usanewsgroup.com/2020/11/16/live-streaming-is-taking-the-market-by-storm/\n\nDISCLAIMER: Nothing in this publication should be considered as personalized financial advice.

They offer a new way of handling finances that is faster, more secure, and more anonymous than traditional methods. But which cryptocurrencies will be the most successful in the long run? Some speculate that Logarithmic Finance (LOG) could be more successful than Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). So, what is LOG, and why might it be a better choice than other cryptocurrencies? Read on to find out!\n\nLogarithmic Finance (LOG): Currently Presale Phase 1\n\nLogarithmic Finance (LOG) is a blockchain-based project that wants to bring forth a new era of decentralised finance by focusing on the interoperability problem that plagues the cryptocurrency sector. It is a layer-III swapping technology that seeks to connect early-stage innovators and investors.\n\nBoostX is assisting new cryptocurrency projects such as Logarithmic Finance (LOG) in making their debuts by providing a multichain launchpad. BoostX, as a premium launchpad technology, provides users with access to special presale deals, allowing them to acquire tokens at a lower price before the decentralised exchange (DEX) goes live.\n\nThe expansion of innovators and investors on the LOG platform will be aided by multi-chain integration between the blockchains of Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), Ethereum (ETH), and Polygon (MATIC).\n\nLogarithmic Finance is working to create an environment that can cater to all of its users by offering reduced gas fees and NFT auction functionality, which will be available only to LOG token holders.\n\nWith the DeFi industry surpassing its TVL of $100 billion in July 2021, there is plenty of opportunity for the sector, and one company looks to take advantage. A lightweight user interface, as well as a compelling user interface, are being built by LOG to address the lack of a user-friendly interface and poorly written smart contracts.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE): A Meme Coin that Made Millionaires\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is a decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency that enables users to send and receive money without needing a third party. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Dogecoin is created as a reward for a process known as mining.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) was created by Billy Markus of Portland, Oregon, who hoped to create a fun cryptocurrency that could reach a broader demographic than other coins. In addition, he wanted to distance it from the controversial history of other coins. Dogecoin’s mascot is Shiba Inu, an animal native to Japan.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has a market value of over $18 billion and has experienced a significant increase in value in recent months. Dogecoin is popular among cryptocurrency investors due to its low price and high growth potential. However, cryptocurrency has also been associated with scams and illicit activities. For example, in 2018, a major cryptocurrency exchange was hacked, and over $30 million worth of Dogecoin was stolen. As a result, investors should be aware of the risks associated with investing in Dogecoin.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Dogecoin (DOGE) Killer\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency created as a parody of the popular cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. However, despite its humble beginnings, Shiba Inu has quickly grown in popularity and market value. As of April 2022, the cryptocurrency has a market value of over $13 billion. This makes it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nThe reason for Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s success is mainly due to the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency. More and more people are interested in investing in digital currencies, and Shiba Inu has benefited from this trend. In addition, the cryptocurrency has also gained a lot of attention due to its unique marketing campaign. The Shiba Inu team has used social media to increase awareness of the currency, which has helped drive up its value. Overall, Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency with a lot of potential. Its popularity is only likely to increase in the future as more people become interested in digital currencies.\n\nFor more information see the links below:\n\nPresale: https://presale.logarithmic.finance/register\n\nWebsite: https://logarithmic.finance/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/LOGARITHMIC_FINANCE_OFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LOGARITHMIC_FI\n\nAlways conduct proper research when dealing with pre-sales of currencies and tokens.

For more info, visit our Terms of Use page\n\nFacing a multitude of threats to systems and data, everyone from small and medium businesses to large enterprises and nonprofits are turning to cloud backup and recovery services. Combining both data backup protections and recovery capabilities, disaster recovery as a service solutions help ensure continued operations should a catastrophe, failure, accident or other adverse event occur.\n\nJump to:\n\nSEE: Hiring Kit: Database engineer (TechRepublic Premium)\n\nWhat is disaster recovery as a service?\n\nDRaaS is a cloud computing strategy in which an organization pays a provider to protect the organization’s data and information from disruption ⏤ due either to natural disasters, human error or cyberattacks ⏤ by enabling full operational recovery using a cloud-based solution.\n\nHow does DRaaS work?\n\nDRaaS works in various ways. In some cases, a disaster recovery services vendor will leverage a small appliance installed on-premises at a client’s site. These appliances collect backup images and send backup information offsite where it can later be used to recover operations at a new location. In other cases, DRaaS solutions target continuous data replication to permit spinning up disaster recovery services in the cloud or at another location.\n\nRegardless of the data backup and synchronization strategy, most DRaaS solutions offer many common capabilities, including encrypted data transfer, offsite replication, emergency recovery and maintenance.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using DRaaS?\n\nThe benefits of using DRaaS are that organizations can integrate these cloud-based services within their larger business continuity and disaster recovery plans to properly protect systems, applications and data in a way that also fulfills their specific disaster recovery requirements.\n\nProper and effective disaster planning requires addressing numerous elements, such as system, application and data backups, safe storage of those backups, and quick recovery. DRaaS providers offer a complete smorgasbord of options to organizations of all sizes operating across all industries. These providers tailor their DRaaS solutions to an organization’s specific needs.\n\nA small advertising firm may survive if recovery operations take several days. However, a large accounting firm might need to return to regular operation in just an hour were a disaster to occur during the height of tax season.\n\nTop DRaaS providers and solutions\n\nAcronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect\n\nAcronis offers a variety of cloud-based data protection and recovery solutions. While some Acronis products, such as Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud, are designed for managed services providers to wield assisting customers, still others are built specifically for businesses and organizations.\n\nPaired together, two Acronis products provide organizations with a powerful one-two punch. Known as Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect, this DRaaS solution creates a powerful combination to both protect data and applications and enable disaster recovery.\n\nThe primary product, Acronis Cyber Protect, gives businesses potent backup and recovery software that also includes integrated cybersecurity features. Its single console simplifies managing data and endpoint protection, reducing administration overhead while identifying and resolving issues. Starting at $79 for small- and medium-size environments, the software permits making image, file and local backups. The platform permits bare metal recovery and the recovery of production systems to dissimilar hardware. It is compatible within Windows, Linux, VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V environments.\n\nAdding another Acronis solution, Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery, boosts effectiveness. The service adds a streamlined disaster recovery process in which testing failover and failback of protected data, applications and systems is both enabled and simplified.\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery add-on also enables other critical capabilities. Using the add-on, administrators can customize recovery point objectives that help ensure the most current data is recovered. In the event of a disaster, the add-on also permits recovering and running an organization’s operations directly from Acronis’ cloud server environment. Such potentialities prove critical in the event of floods, fires, tornados and other disasters.\n\nPricing depends upon a number of variables, including the number of protected machines and the amount of data being stored. Firms can test the solution for free for 30 days.\n\nContact Acronis directly at 1-781-782-9000 for more information or with questions.\n\nCarbonite Recover\n\nBoasting push-button failover, Carbonite Recover is a DRaaS offering that reduces the risks of unplanned downtime and operations interruption by securely replicating critical applications and data to the Carbonite cloud. Subsequently, an up-to-date production environment becomes available for immediate failover.\n\nUsing Carbonite’s solution, primary servers can replicate in real-time, at the individual byte level, to the DRaaS cloud (Figure A). Organizations can perform their own non-disruptive, self-service tests, and access and view failover reporting. In the event organizations need more assistance, Carbonite’s technical services team can also provide support, including for deployment, testing and recovery.\n\nFigure A\n\nThe solution works by installing a Carbonite Recovery agent on each system to be protected. Following service configuration, those systems then begin sending encrypted data continuously, and with little adverse performance impact according to the vendor, to the Carbonite cloud.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, organizations can spin up the cloud-based replicas to recover operations. Then, once an organization is ready to return to using its primary production systems, the process is essentially reversed.\n\nSupported across a variety of environments, including Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, VMware and Hyper-V, pricing is based on the number of endpoints, the amount of data and the types of assistive services the organization selects.\n\nContact Carbonite directly at 1-877-542-8637 for more information or with questions.\n\nDatto ALTO & SIRIS\n\nDatto, whose acquisition by Kaseya was announced in April 2022, provides a range of DRaaS and BCDR offerings for MSPs (Figure B).

Recovery time objective: InterVision commits to meeting specific, predetermined recovery time objectives, including for application recovery.\n\nAs is common with DRaaS offerings, pricing is dependent upon a variety of factors. The SLA an organization selects, as well as corresponding RTOs, are among elements impacting cost.\n\nContact InterVision at 1-844-622-5710 for more information or with questions.\n\nMicrosoft Azure Site Recovery\n\nMicrosoft Azure is a scalable solution for more than simply configuring cloud servers and applications. From powering identity management services and virtual desktops to provisioning innovative software development environments, Azure solutions cover an almost bewildering array of functions.\n\nAzure Backup and Azure Site Recovery are but two of a multitude of Azure-powered solutions (Figure C). Teamed together, the two Azure offerings provide a complete DRaaS solution.\n\nFigure C\n\nCapable of securely backing up on-premises and cloud-based servers, virtual machines and Windows and Linux systems, Azure Backup provides everyone from SMBs to enterprise environments a centralized backup center that assists monitoring, administering and scaling backup operations. Whether working with file servers, databases, VMs or other technologies, the offering also supports using APIs, PowerShell and the Azure command-line interface to manage and automate backup and security parameters.\n\nAzure Site Recovery fulfills the second half of the DRaaS function after backing up or replicating data: Recovery. Organizations begin by replicating Azure VMs to a different Azure region, thereby providing geographic protection from common failures and disasters. Azure Site Recovery also permits administrators to retain application availability during primary system outages thanks to automatic recovery, including from an on-premises platform to Azure or from one Azure region to another.\n\nMicrosoft Azure is available from MSPs and VARs, as well as from the vendor directly. For more information, contact Microsoft at 1-855-270-0615.\n\nNutanix Disaster Recovery\n\nSimilar to other cloud providers, Nutanix offers a variety of cloud services, from data analytics to desktops as a service to BCDR solutions. The firm’s Data Disaster Recovery platform simplifies replicating data across multiple sites to ensure and speed disaster recovery.\n\nWith always-on availability across multiple sites and geographic distancing, the DRaaS solution replicates data synchronously, thereby minimizing data loss and downtime. With the ability to continue powering business operations even when multiple sites fail simultaneously, Nutanix assists in implementing aggressive RPOs and RTOs to permit rapid recovery.\n\nBoasting centralized management and supporting the administration of both on-premises and cloud platforms, the service permits customizing BCDR plans as an organization requires. Nutanix’ DRaaS service also integrates with third-party data protection solutions to better enable granular data recovery.\n\nThe firm’s services can be purchased from resellers as well as directly from Nutanix, For more information on the company, contact Nutanix at 1-855-NUTANIX.\n\nQuorum DRaaS\n\nAvailable from partners or directly from Quorum itself, Quorum onQ claims status as a leader in the single-click instant recovery space. By automatically maintaining current critical system and application data on ready-to-run VM clones of an organization’s physical and virtual servers stored on a dedicated appliance, recovery can be simplified to a single click.\n\nBuilt on top of high-availability infrastructure, the Quorum solution supports storing backup archives and images for the long term. The solution also offers isolated sandbox environments for testing patches and upgrades, deduplication to reduce storage and bandwidth requirements and a host of migration tools.\n\nCompatible with both on-premises and cloud servers, standalone or VMs, Quorum’s service actually tests server snapshots each time a snapshot is made. Such automated DR testing helps ensure operations can be properly recovered, including full bare metal restores to dissimilar hardware and from physical to virtual or virtual to physical servers.\n\nFor more information, contact Quorum at 1-877-997-8678.\n\nServiceNow Business Continuity Management\n\nSold via partner programs and directly to businesses, ServiceNow’s Business Continuity Management solution includes the traditional array of DRaaS features, including setting RTO and RPO targets. The service also supports practicing recovery operations, activating continuity plans and monitoring backup and recovery tasks.\n\nThe solution includes yet other capabilities, too. Using the service, organizations can help eliminate surprises by using data stored within the ServiceNow continuity management platform to monitor for risks and identify possible gaps in recovery capabilities.\n\nOne of the persistent challenges with BCDR plans is the rate at which production environment components change. ServiceNow’s BCDR’s services assist organizations in managing such issues by permitting automation of plan maintenance with larger BCDR workflows powered by the ServiceNow platform.\n\nServiceNow’s business continuity management initiative also encourages prioritizing critical applications, services, processes and sites. Subsequently, ServiceNow’s DRaaS solutions offer compelling benefits, especially for firms that depend on ServiceNow for CRM, DevOps and other operations assistance.\n\nFor more information, contact ServiceNow using its Contact Us page.\n\nShadowProtect\n\nPlagued by a data loss event that primarily impacted MSP clients beginning in March 2022, Arcserve’s StorageCraft backup service proved prone to human error. An extended period of degraded operation, in which business’ data backups reportedly proved inaccessible, looks to have been due to mistakes made when preparing backend upgrades, according to Arcserve’s CEO.\n\nWith Arcserve working diligently to solve the problem and communicating proactively with customers and partners, the firm remains a player within the DRaaS space. The ShadowProtect brand was long previously trusted to enable both data backups and recovery.\n\nSold by partners as well as directly to businesses, StorageCraft’s ShadowProtect DRaaS boasts cross-platform coverage, including for Windows and Linux systems, physical servers and VMs. The storage-agnostic solution supports most disk-based storage technologies, including the OneXafe NAS storage format. With broad hypervisor support, including for Microsoft, Red Hat Enterprise and VMware technologies, the service offers the typical DRaaS scheduling, replication, testing and migration features SMBs and enterprises require.\n\nFor more information, contact StorageCraft at 1-801-545-4711.\n\nVMware Site Recovery\n\nSold by partners and direct, VMware Site Recovery protects both on-premises and VMware AWS and Dell EMC installations. The solution is an add-on service for organizations using VMware Cloud on AWS and VMware Cloud on Dell EMC.\n\nPowered by its own vSphere technologies, including VMware’s native vSphere Replication hypervisor software and the VMware Site Recovery Manager, the DRaaS solution reduces secondary recovery site requirements and expenses by leveraging cloud replication advantages, which permit accelerating recovery efforts.\n\nBy pairing configurations, such as a client’s physical production site with a recovery target powered by VMware Cloud on AWS, DRaaS can be integrated with other VMware administration and operation components. As is now expected from enterprise solutions, the platform supports non-disruptive recovery testing and verification. Because fast recovery is so important, the solution can assist by automating and managing critical business operations when an unplanned outage occurs.\n\nLicensing and compatibility issues can arise due to the service’s goal supporting a wide range of technologies. Fortunately, VMware maintains online tools, including the VMware Product Interoperability Matrices and the VMware Compatibility Guide, organizations can use to plan and research potential issues.\n\nAvailable on-demand or via one- and three-year commitments, subscription fees are paid upfront, whereas on-demand usage is billed hourly and invoiced monthly. VMware Site Recovery is priced as a separate add-on from VMware Cloud on AWS but includes the VMware Site Recovery Manager and vSphere Replication elements needed for recovering either to a VMware Cloud on AWS instance or an on-premises box.\n\nContact VMware with questions or for more information at 1-877-486-9273.\n\nZerto Disaster Recovery as a Service\n\nZerto, now an HP enterprise, provides a range of DRaaS services via an expansive partner network. The company’s offerings include both continuous data protection (CDP) as well as DRaaS options.\n\nThe Zerto technologies eliminate snapshots in favor of a CDP strategy that the vendor states results in “industry-lowest” RPOs and RTOs. The platform, software and hardware are agnostic, thereby encouraging compatibility with a wide range of production systems. Zerto DRaaS services permit storing data on premises and in the cloud or any combination therein, and, because hundreds of MSPs serve as partners, design, implementation and support services are widespread.\n\nOther features include non-disruptive testing, spatial geographic protection and an option to fully automate recovery and mitigation efforts. The solution also benefits from its approachability, in that its software-only administrative interface smooths adoption and management.\n\nOrganizations can choose from multiple billing models. Pay-as-you-go plans are available, as are a variety of data protection and support options.

It used own tools in the process, as follows:\n\nUpdate Compliance and Microsoft Endpoint Manager\'s endpoint analytics feature to gauge device readiness\n\nThe Windows Update for Business Deployment Service, which was said to reduce the number of policies needed for the Windows 11 deployments and allow for easy operating system rollbacks\n\nThe Windows Autopilot service for provisioning new machines built by original equipment manufacturer partners\n\nMicrosoft Power BI for tracking devices by "country and region" and Windows 11 upgrade "eligibility," and for notifying users not qualifying for an upgrade\n\n"Yammer, FAQs, Microsoft SharePoint, email, Microsoft Teams, our internal homepage, and digital signage" for communicating with employees about the upgrade.\n\nMicrosoft also let its employees check the ability to upgrade to Windows 11 via use of the PC Health Check app. However, its support teams "didn\'t get many upgrade tickets" as a result.\n\nMicrosoft claimed that this Windows 11 upgrade effort represented the "fastest deployment in company history."\n\nThe announcement did not mention using Microsoft Intune, the company\'s PC and mobile device management service for the Windows 11 deployments, but it described not using images, which is a typically touted Intune benefit.\n\n"Our success was built around several factors: far fewer app compatibility challenges than in the past, not needing to build out a plethora of disk images, and delivery processes and tools already that were greatly improved during the rollout of Windows 10," Microsoft indicated.\n\nWindows 11 Use Still Lags\n\nOf Microsoft\'s client operating systems, Windows 10 use predominates at 74.82 percent, vs. Windows 7\'s 12.11 percent and Windows 11\'s 8.45 percent, according to March 2022 information compiled by Statcounter.com. Windows 11 has stringent hardware requirements that precludes some Windows 10 machines from making a jump to Windows 11.\n\nThe Windows 11 hardware requirements enforce the use of newer processors and a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 chip for security. David Weston, vice president for OS security and enterprise at Microsoft, recently doubled down on the view that the stricter hardware upgrade requirements for Windows 11 was the right call in this Twitter post. Weston also recently described Windows 11 as just making the security protections in Windows 10 easier to access.', 'image': 'https://rcpmag.com/-/media/ECG/redmondmag/Images/introimages/REDMackieXPMigration.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:09'}

Unfortunately, the Medic Agent itself can cause problems by having high RAM, high CPU, and high disk usage. Luckily, the WaaS MedicAgent can be disabled completely.\n\nWhat Is WaaSMedicAgent.exe?\n\nNo software is perfect — things go wrong, and files break, including Windows Updates (especially Windows Updates). Windows as a Service Medic Agent (WaaSMedicAgent) was introduced in Windows 10 to “Enable remediation and protection of Windows Update components.” In other words, it fixes problems with Windows Update that might prevent your PC from updating.\n\nThis process is supposed to run when Windows encounters a problem with an update. Unfortunately, the Medic Agent itself has been known to cause problems. In some cases, it bogs down PCs for hours by maxing out CPUs, causing extremely high RAM usage, and causing high disk usage.\n\nIs It Malware?\n\nWaaSMedicAgent.exe is a legitimate part of Windows 10 and Windows 11. It has occasionally caused problems that resemble malicious behavior, but it isn’t malware. Of course, it is relatively common for malware authors to try to disguise malware as legitimate applications and services. You can run a scan with Microsoft Defender and Malwarebytes’ Antivirus to rule out the possibility.\n\nHow to Disable WaaSMedicAgent\n\nThough it can be annoying, you should seriously consider whether or not you want to stop the executable from running and disable the service. Windows Update will still function even if Medic Agent is disabled, but it might not be able to recover from an error if one occurs during an update.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat said, if you want to disable WaaSMedicAgent, here are a few ways you can do it.\n\nDelay Your Updates\n\nWaaSMedicAgent should only be activated if Windows Update encounters an issue. Pausing Windows 10 or Windows 11 updates can temporarily stop WaaSMedicAgent from using excessive amounts of RAM, maxing out your disk usage, utilizing your CPU, and otherwise bogging down your PC. It won’t permanently solve any of your problems, though.\n\nIf you just need to get your system working for a bit pausing updates is a good option. Just remember to let it run later so it can try to fix whatever error occurred.\n\nDisable WaaSMedicAgent Using RegEdit\n\nWaaSMedicAgent is the Windows Service that is associated with WaaSMedicAgent.exe — if you want to stop the executable from running, you need to disable the service as well. Windows will not allow you to disable the service from the Services app, but you can disable it using the Registry Editor (RegEdit). As always, be careful editing the Windows Registry. Deleting a key accidentally — or even changing a value — can cause serious problems for computers, and major headaches for humans.\n\nRELATED: Learning to Use the Registry Editor Like a Pro\n\nFirst, you need to launch RegEdit. Click the Start button, type “regedit” into the search bar, and then hit Enter or click “Open.”\n\nNavigate to the following path in the Registry Editor window, or copy-paste the following line into its address bar and press Enter:\n\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WaaSMedicSvc\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWaaSMedicService is the name of the registry key. You’ll see it in the left pane. Registry keys are a bit like folders. They can contain subkeys, which are like subfolders, and properties, which are like files.\n\nEvery registry key found within “Services” will have a property named “Start” that determines when or why the service will be launched.\n\nStart can take a few different values:\n\n2 is “Automatic”\n\n3 is “Manual”\n\n4 is “Disabled”\n\nDouble-click the “Start” property in the right pane and change the value to 4, and then click “Ok.”\n\nTip: If you’ve used the Services app before, you might have noticed that some services are Automatic, but are specifically designed to start “Delayed.” The property that sets “Delayed” is named “DelayedAutoStart”. A value of 1 enables delayed automatic start, while 0 disables delayed automatic start.\n\nDisable Using Our Registry Keys\n\nIf you don’t want to mess with the registry yourself, there are two registry keys attached to this article. One is named “Disable_WaaSMedicSvc.reg” and will disable WaasMedicSvc (and WaaSMedicAgent.exe) completely. The other REG file is named “ReEnabled_WaaSMedicSvc.reg” and will return the service to its default value.\n\nWaaSMedic_Registry_Keys\n\nJust download the zip file, extract the contents anywhere, and double-click “Disable_WaaSMedicSvc.reg.” You’ll receive a warning about the dangers of applying registry keys — hit “Yes.”\n\nKeep in mind that other components of Windows Update will probably re-enable the Medic Service at some point in time in the future. If you haven’t fixed the issue with Windows Update, you might suddenly find the service set to manual and WaaSMedicAgent.exe running unexpectedly. You can always just kick the can down the road and disable the service again, but you shouldn’t. If you have the time, let the Medic Agent run, or try to fix Windows Update manually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe registry key we provided might be helpful if you need to disable WaaSMedicSvc repeatedly since you only need to double-click it to set the service to “Disabled” again.', 'image': 'https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-11-and-10.png?height=200p&trim=2,2,2,2', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:59'}

Meal kit services will send all the ingredients for any given recipe, usually premeasured and sometimes even prepped: as in chopped, minced or with certain dry ingredients already mixed together and ready to use. Convenient as they may be, most people consider meal kits to be a much more expensive alternative to buying groceries in a store. For certain services that's true but a crop of cheaper meal kit delivery services has significantly closed the gap. That's especially true considering the current inflation woes and rising cost of groceries.\n\nSo then, how much more expensive are meal kits versus buying the necessary groceries? I was wondering that very thing and with the cheapest meal kits clocking in at just $5 per serving, I had an inkling it would be pretty close. In calculating the grocery cost for two recipes from my favorite budget-friendly meal kit service, , it turns out just a measly buck or two separates the two mealtime approaches, and the perception of meal kits as pricey date-splurge may be more myth than reality in 2022.\n\nMeal kit vs. grocery store\n\nEveryPlate (meals for 2) EveryPlate (meals for 4) Groceries bought at the store Cost per serving $7.39 $6.50 $5.26\n\nSo how did I get these numbers?\n\nTo calculate the cost of meal kits when compared to buying the groceries, I took two EveryPlate recipes and priced out the ingredients. To keep things consistent I used the cheapest results that populated on , a popular online grocery delivery service here in the Northeast.\n\nSince spices are generally sold in 1- or 2-ounce bottles, I divided the cost by 20 since each bottle of spices contains roughly 20 servings. The same goes for ingredients like sour cream and soy sauce that are also sold in larger quantities. I divided the total cost by roughly how much you'd need to execute each recipe.\n\nRead more: Best Cheap Meal Delivery Services in 2022\n\nHow much does a meal kit service like EveryPlate cost?\n\nEveryPlate is one of the cheapest meal kit services, with clocking in at $5 a serving. For a meal plan for two people and three meals per week, it's slightly more at $5.89 a serving. I used the to compare with the cost of buying your own groceries. There's also a $9 flat shipping cost which I divided by the three meals. When it's all said and done, EveryPlate will cost you $7.39 a serving.\n\nEveryPlate\n\nHow much meal kits would cost if you bought the groceries\n\nBelow is a breakdown of what two would cost if you bought the groceries yourself. These prices were calculated from in early April of 2022. I didn't include the delivery fees for a grocery service or the cost of gas required to get yourself to and from the store. It's also worth noting that the grocery prices listed below are significantly lower than what I find at my local markets in Brooklyn.\n\nSmothered pork chops with home fries and carrots (2 servings)\n\nCarrots (12 ounces): $1.50\n\nFive Yukon gold potatoes: $1.50\n\nOne yellow onion: $0.90\n\n\n\nTwo scallions: $0.50\n\n\n\nTwo 5-ounce pork chops: $4.93\n\n\n\nOne packet of chicken stock concentrate: $0.60\n\n\n\nCayenne pepper: $0.20\n\n\n\nSour cream (2 ounces): $1.50\n\n\n\nTotal: $11.13\n\nCost per serving: $5.56\n\nEveryPlate\n\nCherry meatballs with zucchini and garlic mashed potatoes (2 servings)\n\nFive Yukon gold potatoes: $1.60\n\nWhite bread (one slice): $0.50\n\nOne zucchini: $1.50\n\nGround beef (8 ounces): $3.50\n\nCherry jam (1 ounce): $0.85\n\nGarlic powder: $0.10\n\nSour cream (2 ounces): $1.50\n\nSoy sauce (1 ounce): $0.50\n\nTotal: $10.05\n\nCost per serving: $5.02\n\nDavid Watsky/CNET\n\nHow much more is a meal kit than buying groceries?\n\nWhen compared to the cost of buying all the necessary groceries at the store, EveryPlate clocks in at around $2 more per serving. If you were to pick one of the plans with servings for four, it would be more like $1 more. So, it's pretty much a wash.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's convenience you're paying a little extra for. But if you choose a budget-friendly service such as EveryPlate or Dinnerly, that little extra turns out to be barely anything at all.\n\nRead more: EveryPlate Review: See How the Cheapest Meal Kit Service Holds Up in a Test\n\nWhat about the environmental cost, packaging and waste?\n\nThere's no doubt that meal kit services use more plastic than if you buy your own groceries. That said, the cheaper services have found ways to cut costs. In many cases, that means using less packaging.\n\nShelby Brown/CNET\n\nEveryPlate, for instance, is one of the most eco-friendly services I've tried. The company puts all its produce and other ingredients in a single cardboard box, whereas others individually package each ingredient, creating more waste. Most of the packaging, including the cooler box and ice packs are curbside recyclable.\n\nOn the flip side, since meal kits generally give you exactly what you need for each meal and no more, you're less likely to have food waste. Who hasn't thrown out those last few ounces from a tub of sour cream or a couple of scallions you couldn't find a use for before they wilted away?\n\nWhat about other meal kit services?\n\nEveryPlate is the cheapest meal kit service, along with The most expensive outfits -- Sunbasket, Green Chef, Martha Stewart and Marley Spoon and Blue Apron -- cost closer to $10 or $13 a serving. The added cost is generally due to premium ingredients like grass-fed beef and organic produce. With those, you're going to find a bigger delta between the meal kit cost and what it would cost to make the meal at home. Services like HelloFresh and Home Chef fall somewhere in the middle with meal kits ranging from around $8 and $10 a serving.\n\nNot interested in cooking at all?

Some services see it as a chance to encourage upgrades or just as free advertising for the paid service. Others, however, host third-party ads, which means you may be targeted based on your browsing habits—potentially killing the point of using a VPN in the first place—while others might be analyzing the websites you visit in the name of optimization or big data collection.\n\nIf you plan on using a VPN long term it’s a good idea to pay for the privilege. That way you get more server locations, more simultaneous device connections, and sometimes even better speeds. Restrictions on free services vary by service provider, but there are always restrictions of some kind.\n\nNevertheless, free VPNs are good if you just want to try out a service for a while, or if you only need a VPN every now and then. If you’re looking for a VPN for Windows here are our top recommendations.\n\nIf and when you decide to upgrade to full-fledged paid service, check out our comprehensive roundup of the best VPN services—our recommendations vary from this list once money is on the line.\n\n1. ProtonVPN – Best overall Best Prices Today: When it comes to Windows and free VPNs you can’t beat ProtonVPN. The free version only allows one device connection at a time per account, but that’s all you need if Windows is your focus. ProtonVPN’s speeds are second best in our tests of the paid services, but ProtonVPN does limit free account speeds somewhat to what it calls “Medium speed.” These speeds were entirely acceptable, however, for all the various things you might want to do such as video streaming or regular web browsing. Note, however, that explicit Netflix support is not part of the free offering. We also like ProtonVPN’s app design, which can be expanded to a larger version with an interactive map. Alternatively, it can be reduced to something more like a smartphone app. ProtonVPN requires an email address and password to use the free version and users are limited to three country choices. Read our full ProtonVPN review 2. Windscribe – Best for multiple devices Windscribe is the value choice if you want a lot of extra features and fewer limitations than other free services with one big exception. Namely, that you only get 10GB worth of data per month. That is not enough for a lot of video streaming, but it’s fine for everything else. As a trade-off there are no device limits and you get 10 location choices, which is more than most free services. The Windscribe app is also pretty straightforward Windscribe requires you to sign up with an email address. Read our full Windscribe Pro review 3. Hide.me – Also recommended Best Prices Today: Hide.me is a mix of both ProtonVPN and Windscribe. Similar to Windscribe you only get 10GB per month with the free version, and like ProtonVPN you only get one device at a time. Country choices are narrowed down to four with two regions in the U.S. for a total of five location options. Read our full Hide.me review\n\nWhat to look for in a free VPN on Windows\n\nWhen you’re shopping for a free service for Windows the criteria are similar to what you’d consider for a general free VPN. You want a service that is not displaying third-party ads or harvesting your browsing habits. Privacy is key with VPNs and even on a free one there’s no reason to compromise.\n\nNext, you can consider what’s important to you such as ease of use with an interface you understand, speeds, and country choices. That last point is going to be fairly restricted when going free, because that’s standard practice for free VPNs. Nevertheless, if you want a U.S. connection, for example, most free services will offer that.\n\nIf you’re hoping to use Netflix overseas with a free VPN you may be out of luck. Sometimes it might work on a regular U.S. server, but for the most part Netflix streaming requires specialty servers provided as part of a premium package. Other streaming services, however, may not be as picky as Netflix is when it comes to detecting VPN connections.\n\nHow we test VPNs\n\nAll VPNs tested on Windows go through a three-day process. Each day we test the VPN speeds in five different countries plus the base speed without a VPN connection. Each country is tested three times per day taking the average.\n\nWhen the testing is done we take the average of the base speed, and the overall global average of the VPN speeds. Then we represent the drop from the base speed as a percentage. The idea is to show how generally good a VPN is across all locations, and not just Europe or the United States. We also don’t show specific megabytes-per-second speed since those speeds can vary greatly, but how much dip to expect as a percentage can be more generalized.\n\nFree VPNs can sometimes hamper the speeds compared to what you see on free VPNs; however, that’s not as much of a concern here as all the VPNs we recommend have good speeds regardless.\n\nFinding a good free VPN for Windows is fairly simple. It all depends on whether you prioritize features like unlimited data usage, extra features, or a higher number of country options.', 'image': 'https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/free-gettyimages-1056445318-100825073-orig-100915024-orig-1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:12'}

As a result, cybersecurity risk management is a complex and ever-changing field.\n\nAfter checking out some online surveys, we found around 304.7 million ransomware attempts in the first half of 2021. In the second half, it was even worse, reaching 318.6 million. These figures have even beaten 2020 in total, which was 281.9 million ransomware attacks. So, it’s apparent that cybersecurity risk management is complex and requires IT security professionals to understand the threats posed by cybercriminals.\n\nBut before this, companies should also understand the concept of cybersecurity risk management, the assessment process, some common threats, plus the best practices to keep their data and resources safe from potential cyberattacks.\n\n\u200dSo, let’s get started.\n\nWhat is Cybersecurity Risk Management?\n\nCybersecurity risk management is identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to an organization’s electronic information and systems. It includes the implementation of security controls to protect against cyber threats. The goal of cybersecurity risk management is to reduce the probability and impact of cyberattacks. It is a continuous process that should be adapted as the threats develop.\n\nWhat is a Cybersecurity Risk Assessment?\n\nA cybersecurity risk assessment comprehensively evaluates an organization’s cybersecurity risks. It identifies and assesses the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic information and systems.\n\nThe assessment process includes:\n\nIdentifying the assets at risk.\n\nAssessing the vulnerabilities.\n\nDetermining the impact of a potential breach.\n\n\u200d\n\nIt is important to note that a risk assessment is not a one-time event. It should be performed regularly to ensure that the security controls are adequate and up-to-date.\n\nWhat are Cyber Threats?\n\nCyber threats are malicious attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in electronic information and systems. The attackers can gain access to sensitive data, disrupt business operations, or cause damage to the system. There are many different cyber threats like adversarial threats, technical vulnerabilities, and insider threats.\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\nLet’s understand the common cyber threats in detail:\n\nAdversarial Threats: Adversarial threats are the most common type of cyber threat. Cybercriminals who want to gain access to sensitive data or disrupt business operations launch them.\n\n\u200d\n\nTechnical Vulnerabilities: Technical vulnerabilities are weaknesses in designing or implementing electronic information and systems. Attackers can exploit them to access sensitive data or disrupt business operations.\n\n\u200d\n\nInsider Threats: Insider threats are launched by employees, contractors, or other insiders who have legitimate access to the organization’s electronic information and systems. They can exploit their access to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or disrupt business operations.\n\nAlso, know the key threat factors that affect the majority of organizations:\n\n\u200dPhishing is a type of cyber-attack that uses email or other forms of communication to trick users into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware.Phishing:\n\n\u200d\n\nRansomware: A malware that encrypts a victim’s files and demands a ransom to decrypt them.\n\n\u200d\n\nMalware: A software designed to damage or disable computers and computer systems.\n\n\u200d\n\nBotnets: A network of infected computers that are controlled by a cybercriminal.\n\n\u200d\n\nSQL Injection: An attack that inserts malicious code into a database.\n\n\u200d\n\nDenial-of-Service (DoS) Attack: An attack that overloads a system with requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.\n\nBest Practices for Cybersecurity Risk Assessment\n\nHere are some best practices for conducting a cybersecurity risk assessment:\n\n1. Identify the Assets at Risk: The first step is to identify the electronic information and systems that need to be protected. It includes all the devices, data, and applications essential to the business’s operation.\n\n\u200d\n\n2. Assess the Vulnerabilities: The next step is to assess the assets’ vulnerabilities at risk. It includes identifying the weaknesses in the security controls that attackers could exploit.\n\n\u200d\n\n3. Determine the Impact of a Potential Breach: Always consider the potential impact when conducting a risk assessment. It includes the financial, reputational, and operational damage that a successful attack could cause.\n\n\u200d\n\n4. Perform the Assessment Regularly: The risk assessment should be performed regularly to ensure that the security controls are adequate and up-to-date.\n\n\u200d\n\n5. Use a Tool to Automate the Assessment: Many tools available can automate the risk assessment process. It can help save time and resources.\n\n6. Document the Findings:\n\n7. Communicate the Results:\n\n\u200d\n\n8. Review & Update the Security Controls: The security controls should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure effectiveness. It is also important to test the controls to ensure they are working as intended.\n\n\u200d\n\n9. Train Employees: Employees are also a vital part of the security controls. They should be trained on how to identify and report potential threats.\n\n\u200d\n\nCyber Risk Management Frameworks\n\nMany different frameworks can be used for managing cyber risk. The following are some of the most common:\n\n\u200d\n\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework is a set of guidelines for protecting electronic information and systems. It provides a common language for discussing cybersecurity risks.\n\n\u200d\n\nISO 27001: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 is a standard for information security management. It offers a certified set of standards that can be used to manage cyber risks.\n\n\u200d\n\nDoD RMF: The Department of Defense (DoD) Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a set of guidelines for assessing and managing risks to information systems. It is used by the military and other organizations that handle sensitive data.\n\n\u200d\n\nCSF: The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of best practices for managing cybersecurity risks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed it.\n\n\u200d\n\nFAIR Framework: The Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) framework is a set of guidelines for assessing risk. It helps organizations understand, quantify, and manage cyber threats.\n\n\u200d\n\nCybersecurity Risk Management with Strobes VM365\n\nStrobes VM365\n\n\u200d\n\nThe platform allows you to:\n\nAggregate all the vulnerabilities from various security scanners, compensatory tools, internal security team, cyber security vendors and bug bounty platforms.\n\nAuto de-duplicate vulnerabilities of similar nature to ease the burden of doing VM from your IT, Dev & Security teams.\n\nPrioritize vulnerabilities based on various business metrics and threat intel to narrow down your focus to the top 3% of most risky vulnerabilities.\n\nAutomate your application, network, cloud and container security using no-code workflows.\n\nQuantify and visualize your organization risk or build your own KRIs & KPIs to enhance visibility for your management.\n\n\u200d\n\nConclusion\n\nWe hope you might now understand the importance of conducting a cybersecurity risk assessment well. Always remember that managing cyber security risks is not child’s play. It is a continuous and comprehensive process that needs to be performed regularly.\n\nThere are various frameworks and tools available that can help you manage the risks. Select the one that best suits your organization’s needs. And, don’t forget to train your employees. They are also a crucial part of the security controls.\n\n\u200d\n\nFinally, if you are looking for a tool to automate your cybersecurity risk management process, we recommend trying Strobes VM365.

But it, too, merits attention.\n\nThe alert served as a reminder of the two species of cyber threat: the unpredictable, spinning-pinball threats that can lurch out of control and pulverize innocents in random fashion — and the intricately designed, coolly targeted threats meant to ransack a particular organization\'s servers and perhaps its bank account.\n\nThe Ukraine clash may generate plenty of damage of the first type. Indeed, it may already be doing so. But while that conflict progresses, the second type of threat, epitomized by ransomware, is taking no holidays.\n\nA Formal Alarm\n\nIssued in February, days before hostilities broke out between Russia and Ukraine, the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory from the FBI, CISA (the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), and the NSA sounded a formal alarm about "an increase in sophisticated, high-impact ransomware incidents against critical infrastructure organizations globally."\n\nAttack targets are no longer predictably the biggest, richest organizations, according to the report. Ransomware groups have learned to infiltrate enterprise SaaS platforms and exploit them as hubs for firing off waves of malevolent executables at scale, victimizing platform clients, both large and small. According to the advisory, the FBI in 2021 "observed some ransomware threat actors redirecting ransomware efforts away from \'big-game\' and toward mid-sized victims to reduce scrutiny." The FBI’s counterpart agencies in the UK and Australia, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) and Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), concurred that organizations "of all sizes" suffered ransomware attacks throughout the year.\n\nOn the one hand, in this national security sphere, any additional recognition or investment at the top of government is overdue and cannot hurt. On the other, recognition does not mean the government has the reach or means to protect you — something the two species of cyber threat have in common.\n\nWho\'s in Charge?\n\nOne early, grim lesson of the Ukraine cyberwar is that no authority is firmly in charge and no government agency can consistently shield its citizens from blowback. Governments aren\'t even supervising some of the cyber combatants: freelance hacktivists like Anonymous, jamming Russian broadcast channels and the Kremlin website, answer to their own moral code, not a central command in Kyiv. And Ukraine\'s own "I.T. Army" is a barely directed worldwide corps of digital adepts connecting via Telegram to wreak cyber havoc.\n\nWhat could go awry in that woolly, infinitely multilateral conflict sphere? No national cyber defense framework can keep innocent parties from becoming collateral damage.\n\nThe thing is, no government ransomware policy can unilaterally create a safer, more secure environment either.\n\nGovernment cannot remake the trend throughout the private sector toward hybrid compute workloads. With a thoughtful hybrid strategy, an enterprise hosts its more sensitive workloads on-premises, and deploys less critical resources to a more economical third-party public cloud provider. The practice may yield savings, but with the simultaneous concern that roles and responsibilities once firmly controlled by data center operators may be much less clearly delineated. Involving cloud providers makes evaluating risk and modeling effective security controls more complex. It must be done, but it is up to individual organizations.\n\nGovernment can recommend private interests perform overdue software updates or implement dual-factor authentication protocols. But those best practices will never be mandated by act of Congress; they are up to individual organizations.\n\nInfluencers from security agencies can keynote one conference after another, emphasizing today\'s key challenge for CISOs everywhere: threat visibility across the environments they\'re laboring to secure. CISOs can\'t defend against threats they can’t see. Total, real-time visibility into IT and cloud infrastructure is the ideal; the reality is, almost all organizations lack it. They\'re unaware of what devices and individuals are connected, with what access to sensitive systems and data. Visibility into third-party access to company systems also remains poor. To spot ransomware before it digs in and does damage, CISOs should be adopting security solutions that visualize an entire attack surface. But the initiative to make such visibility a top priority must come from CISOs themselves.\n\nFamiliar Advice\n\nThe conclusions drawn by the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory are recommendations, not directives — and if you\'ve been tracking the rise of ransomware, they feel familiar: Keep systems and software up to date. Train workers to spot phishing links and dodgy attachments. Implement 2FA. Back up your data. We have heard this advice before; the advisory simply delivers it from a higher-echelon source.\n\nThat doesn\'t mean it\'s dismissible — quite the contrary. But what is really important is how organizations everywhere react. The Ukraine conflict is erasing the last vestiges of complacency about the destabilizing, out-of-control threat of cyber weapons. We should do all we can to see that this cybersecurity advisory does the same for the threat of well-controlled, ruthlessly targeted cyber piracy.', 'image': 'https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt66983808af36a8ef/blt5cd0db1cd55a65fc/6217f9bab4efa244505bb288/Malware_marcos_alvarado_Alamy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:55'}

In our recently released 2022 Sanctions Report we noted that the impact, frequency, and intensity of ransomware has increased significantly, presenting continued financial, regulatory, operational and reputational challenges for companies. The war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions placed on Russia have only served to increase and evolve that threat.\n\nCompanies need to enhance their security and compliance controls to prepare for a shift in the way attackers are adapting their tactics to this new reality.\n\nDigitalization Creates Risks\n\nThe pandemic supercharged digital transformation trends with significant but often hastily implemented and insufficiently secured technology adoption, usage of the cloud and other remote working and emerging technologies. Seamless global connectivity has made organizations more agile; however, it has also made them more vulnerable to attacks. The attack surface has expanded with cyber-attacks affecting organizations across all industries ranging from infrastructure operators to food producers to healthcare and education facilities. As the capabilities of cybercriminal groups increased in the past years, so have their breadth of targets and attacks now increasingly focus on a combination of disruptive attacks and data theft.\n\nGeopolitics continues to shape the cyber threat environment, with some governments tacitly endorsing cyber as another tool to punish adversaries. Most recently, President Biden warned of Russian cyberattacks against the U.S. and that companies should be alert to threats and take steps to prepare now.\n\nRansomware’s Multiple Impacts\n\nThough many companies have taken steps to improve their security and resilience, no system is impenetrable. Ransomware groups have demonstrated this truth, improving their tactics and tools to maximize the impact and returns of their operations. For instance, new tactics such as double or sometimes triple extortion, where criminals encrypt, exfiltrate and threaten to publish sensitive data have increased hugely over the past two years.\n\nWhen organizations think of ransomware attacks, generally they consider the data implications and the financial fallout that could take place as a result first. But there are also other impacts to consider including regulatory, reputational and legal challenges. Many jurisdictions require that regulators be notified following a breach, and organizations must also assess their legal obligation to issue data breach notifications to all impacted parties – even if the ransom has already been paid.\n\nOne threat that few organizations have considered is the prospect of sanctions violations. If your organization is the victim of a ransomware attack and faced with the question of whether to pay a ransom, it is at risk of a violation if the attacker is affiliated with a sanctioned state such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, or even a sanctioned criminal group. Sanctions compliance requires clearly knowing the attacking entity and carrying out due diligence on that entity prior to payment, but in cyberspace, it is often difficult to know who you are dealing with.\n\nPreparing for a Potential Cyber Attack\n\nWith increased risks and regulatory concerns, organizations need to prepare for when a cyberattack will happen, not if it will happen. In the past, cyberattacks could be handled internally and largely by the IT organization, but the sophistication and severity of today’s attacks now make this impossible. Organizations need to have an integrated plan that takes into account the many lines of responsibility and stakeholders involved in the event of an attack.\n\nCritical aspects of this plan should include assessing and monitoring a constantly changing cyber threat landscape. This informs decision-making and helps to ensure security and technology spending are proportionate to the unique threats that every organization faces. Knowing your potential adversaries, or at least scenario planning the intent and capability of potential threat actors to target your organization – including the likely intrusion points – is crucial. It helps to build a robust control environment. It also informs the operational response when the inevitable does happen, including decisions around whether to facilitate a crypto-currency payment.\n\nWhile the cyber risks for organizations continue to increase, U.S. companies have taken a more proactive approach to cyber risk management. The governance of cybersecurity is no longer solely an IT-department responsibility, and business leaders recognize cyber attacks as a major risk for their organizations. By identifying how cyber and ransomware attacks have shifted, understanding the organizational risks that could take place if a breach occurs, and developing a plan of action to respond to a potential attack, organizations will be best positioned for success.\n\nAbout the author:: James Owen is the Global Head of Cyber Security at Control Risks, overseeing the threat intelligence, cyber risk consulting and cyber response teams in EMEA, Asia and the Americas.

As a result, cybersecurity risk management is a complex and ever-changing field.\n\nAfter checking out some online surveys, we found around 304.7 million ransomware attempts in the first half of 2021. In the second half, it was even worse, reaching 318.6 million. These figures have even beaten 2020 in total, which was 281.9 million ransomware attacks. So, it’s apparent that cybersecurity risk management is complex and requires IT security professionals to understand the threats posed by cybercriminals.\n\nBut before this, companies should also understand the concept of cybersecurity risk management, the assessment process, some common threats, plus the best practices to keep their data and resources safe from potential cyberattacks.\n\n\u200dSo, let’s get started.\n\nWhat is Cybersecurity Risk Management?\n\nCybersecurity risk management is identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to an organization’s electronic information and systems. It includes the implementation of security controls to protect against cyber threats. The goal of cybersecurity risk management is to reduce the probability and impact of cyberattacks. It is a continuous process that should be adapted as the threats develop.\n\nWhat is a Cybersecurity Risk Assessment?\n\nA cybersecurity risk assessment comprehensively evaluates an organization’s cybersecurity risks. It identifies and assesses the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic information and systems.\n\nThe assessment process includes:\n\nIdentifying the assets at risk.\n\nAssessing the vulnerabilities.\n\nDetermining the impact of a potential breach.\n\n\u200d\n\nIt is important to note that a risk assessment is not a one-time event. It should be performed regularly to ensure that the security controls are adequate and up-to-date.\n\nWhat are Cyber Threats?\n\nCyber threats are malicious attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in electronic information and systems. The attackers can gain access to sensitive data, disrupt business operations, or cause damage to the system. There are many different cyber threats like adversarial threats, technical vulnerabilities, and insider threats.\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\nLet’s understand the common cyber threats in detail:\n\nAdversarial Threats: Adversarial threats are the most common type of cyber threat. Cybercriminals who want to gain access to sensitive data or disrupt business operations launch them.\n\n\u200d\n\nTechnical Vulnerabilities: Technical vulnerabilities are weaknesses in designing or implementing electronic information and systems. Attackers can exploit them to access sensitive data or disrupt business operations.\n\n\u200d\n\nInsider Threats: Insider threats are launched by employees, contractors, or other insiders who have legitimate access to the organization’s electronic information and systems. They can exploit their access to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or disrupt business operations.\n\nAlso, know the key threat factors that affect the majority of organizations:\n\n\u200dPhishing is a type of cyber-attack that uses email or other forms of communication to trick users into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware.Phishing:\n\n\u200d\n\nRansomware: A malware that encrypts a victim’s files and demands a ransom to decrypt them.\n\n\u200d\n\nMalware: A software designed to damage or disable computers and computer systems.\n\n\u200d\n\nBotnets: A network of infected computers that are controlled by a cybercriminal.\n\n\u200d\n\nSQL Injection: An attack that inserts malicious code into a database.\n\n\u200d\n\nDenial-of-Service (DoS) Attack: An attack that overloads a system with requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.\n\nBest Practices for Cybersecurity Risk Assessment\n\nHere are some best practices for conducting a cybersecurity risk assessment:\n\n1. Identify the Assets at Risk: The first step is to identify the electronic information and systems that need to be protected. It includes all the devices, data, and applications essential to the business’s operation.\n\n\u200d\n\n2. Assess the Vulnerabilities: The next step is to assess the assets’ vulnerabilities at risk. It includes identifying the weaknesses in the security controls that attackers could exploit.\n\n\u200d\n\n3. Determine the Impact of a Potential Breach: Always consider the potential impact when conducting a risk assessment. It includes the financial, reputational, and operational damage that a successful attack could cause.\n\n\u200d\n\n4. Perform the Assessment Regularly: The risk assessment should be performed regularly to ensure that the security controls are adequate and up-to-date.\n\n\u200d\n\n5. Use a Tool to Automate the Assessment: Many tools available can automate the risk assessment process. It can help save time and resources.\n\n6. Document the Findings:\n\n7. Communicate the Results:\n\n\u200d\n\n8. Review & Update the Security Controls: The security controls should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure effectiveness. It is also important to test the controls to ensure they are working as intended.\n\n\u200d\n\n9. Train Employees: Employees are also a vital part of the security controls. They should be trained on how to identify and report potential threats.\n\n\u200d\n\nCyber Risk Management Frameworks\n\nMany different frameworks can be used for managing cyber risk. The following are some of the most common:\n\n\u200d\n\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework is a set of guidelines for protecting electronic information and systems. It provides a common language for discussing cybersecurity risks.\n\n\u200d\n\nISO 27001: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 is a standard for information security management. It offers a certified set of standards that can be used to manage cyber risks.\n\n\u200d\n\nDoD RMF: The Department of Defense (DoD) Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a set of guidelines for assessing and managing risks to information systems. It is used by the military and other organizations that handle sensitive data.\n\n\u200d\n\nCSF: The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of best practices for managing cybersecurity risks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed it.\n\n\u200d\n\nFAIR Framework: The Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) framework is a set of guidelines for assessing risk. It helps organizations understand, quantify, and manage cyber threats.\n\n\u200d\n\nCybersecurity Risk Management with Strobes VM365\n\nStrobes VM365\n\n\u200d\n\nThe platform allows you to:\n\nAggregate all the vulnerabilities from various security scanners, compensatory tools, internal security team, cyber security vendors and bug bounty platforms.\n\nAuto de-duplicate vulnerabilities of similar nature to ease the burden of doing VM from your IT, Dev & Security teams.\n\nPrioritize vulnerabilities based on various business metrics and threat intel to narrow down your focus to the top 3% of most risky vulnerabilities.\n\nAutomate your application, network, cloud and container security using no-code workflows.\n\nQuantify and visualize your organization risk or build your own KRIs & KPIs to enhance visibility for your management.\n\n\u200d\n\nConclusion\n\nWe hope you might now understand the importance of conducting a cybersecurity risk assessment well. Always remember that managing cyber security risks is not child’s play. It is a continuous and comprehensive process that needs to be performed regularly.\n\nThere are various frameworks and tools available that can help you manage the risks. Select the one that best suits your organization’s needs. And, don’t forget to train your employees. They are also a crucial part of the security controls.\n\n\u200d\n\nFinally, if you are looking for a tool to automate your cybersecurity risk management process, we recommend trying Strobes VM365.

But it, too, merits attention.\n\nThe alert served as a reminder of the two species of cyber threat: the unpredictable, spinning-pinball threats that can lurch out of control and pulverize innocents in random fashion — and the intricately designed, coolly targeted threats meant to ransack a particular organization\'s servers and perhaps its bank account.\n\nThe Ukraine clash may generate plenty of damage of the first type. Indeed, it may already be doing so. But while that conflict progresses, the second type of threat, epitomized by ransomware, is taking no holidays.\n\nA Formal Alarm\n\nIssued in February, days before hostilities broke out between Russia and Ukraine, the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory from the FBI, CISA (the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), and the NSA sounded a formal alarm about "an increase in sophisticated, high-impact ransomware incidents against critical infrastructure organizations globally."\n\nAttack targets are no longer predictably the biggest, richest organizations, according to the report. Ransomware groups have learned to infiltrate enterprise SaaS platforms and exploit them as hubs for firing off waves of malevolent executables at scale, victimizing platform clients, both large and small. According to the advisory, the FBI in 2021 "observed some ransomware threat actors redirecting ransomware efforts away from \'big-game\' and toward mid-sized victims to reduce scrutiny." The FBI’s counterpart agencies in the UK and Australia, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) and Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), concurred that organizations "of all sizes" suffered ransomware attacks throughout the year.\n\nOn the one hand, in this national security sphere, any additional recognition or investment at the top of government is overdue and cannot hurt. On the other, recognition does not mean the government has the reach or means to protect you — something the two species of cyber threat have in common.\n\nWho\'s in Charge?\n\nOne early, grim lesson of the Ukraine cyberwar is that no authority is firmly in charge and no government agency can consistently shield its citizens from blowback. Governments aren\'t even supervising some of the cyber combatants: freelance hacktivists like Anonymous, jamming Russian broadcast channels and the Kremlin website, answer to their own moral code, not a central command in Kyiv. And Ukraine\'s own "I.T. Army" is a barely directed worldwide corps of digital adepts connecting via Telegram to wreak cyber havoc.\n\nWhat could go awry in that woolly, infinitely multilateral conflict sphere? No national cyber defense framework can keep innocent parties from becoming collateral damage.\n\nThe thing is, no government ransomware policy can unilaterally create a safer, more secure environment either.\n\nGovernment cannot remake the trend throughout the private sector toward hybrid compute workloads. With a thoughtful hybrid strategy, an enterprise hosts its more sensitive workloads on-premises, and deploys less critical resources to a more economical third-party public cloud provider. The practice may yield savings, but with the simultaneous concern that roles and responsibilities once firmly controlled by data center operators may be much less clearly delineated. Involving cloud providers makes evaluating risk and modeling effective security controls more complex. It must be done, but it is up to individual organizations.\n\nGovernment can recommend private interests perform overdue software updates or implement dual-factor authentication protocols. But those best practices will never be mandated by act of Congress; they are up to individual organizations.\n\nInfluencers from security agencies can keynote one conference after another, emphasizing today\'s key challenge for CISOs everywhere: threat visibility across the environments they\'re laboring to secure. CISOs can\'t defend against threats they can’t see. Total, real-time visibility into IT and cloud infrastructure is the ideal; the reality is, almost all organizations lack it. They\'re unaware of what devices and individuals are connected, with what access to sensitive systems and data. Visibility into third-party access to company systems also remains poor. To spot ransomware before it digs in and does damage, CISOs should be adopting security solutions that visualize an entire attack surface. But the initiative to make such visibility a top priority must come from CISOs themselves.\n\nFamiliar Advice\n\nThe conclusions drawn by the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory are recommendations, not directives — and if you\'ve been tracking the rise of ransomware, they feel familiar: Keep systems and software up to date. Train workers to spot phishing links and dodgy attachments. Implement 2FA. Back up your data. We have heard this advice before; the advisory simply delivers it from a higher-echelon source.\n\nThat doesn\'t mean it\'s dismissible — quite the contrary. But what is really important is how organizations everywhere react. The Ukraine conflict is erasing the last vestiges of complacency about the destabilizing, out-of-control threat of cyber weapons. We should do all we can to see that this cybersecurity advisory does the same for the threat of well-controlled, ruthlessly targeted cyber piracy.', 'image': 'https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt66983808af36a8ef/blt5cd0db1cd55a65fc/6217f9bab4efa244505bb288/Malware_marcos_alvarado_Alamy.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:55'}

In our recently released 2022 Sanctions Report we noted that the impact, frequency, and intensity of ransomware has increased significantly, presenting continued financial, regulatory, operational and reputational challenges for companies. The war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions placed on Russia have only served to increase and evolve that threat.\n\nCompanies need to enhance their security and compliance controls to prepare for a shift in the way attackers are adapting their tactics to this new reality.\n\nDigitalization Creates Risks\n\nThe pandemic supercharged digital transformation trends with significant but often hastily implemented and insufficiently secured technology adoption, usage of the cloud and other remote working and emerging technologies. Seamless global connectivity has made organizations more agile; however, it has also made them more vulnerable to attacks. The attack surface has expanded with cyber-attacks affecting organizations across all industries ranging from infrastructure operators to food producers to healthcare and education facilities. As the capabilities of cybercriminal groups increased in the past years, so have their breadth of targets and attacks now increasingly focus on a combination of disruptive attacks and data theft.\n\nGeopolitics continues to shape the cyber threat environment, with some governments tacitly endorsing cyber as another tool to punish adversaries. Most recently, President Biden warned of Russian cyberattacks against the U.S. and that companies should be alert to threats and take steps to prepare now.\n\nRansomware’s Multiple Impacts\n\nThough many companies have taken steps to improve their security and resilience, no system is impenetrable. Ransomware groups have demonstrated this truth, improving their tactics and tools to maximize the impact and returns of their operations. For instance, new tactics such as double or sometimes triple extortion, where criminals encrypt, exfiltrate and threaten to publish sensitive data have increased hugely over the past two years.\n\nWhen organizations think of ransomware attacks, generally they consider the data implications and the financial fallout that could take place as a result first. But there are also other impacts to consider including regulatory, reputational and legal challenges. Many jurisdictions require that regulators be notified following a breach, and organizations must also assess their legal obligation to issue data breach notifications to all impacted parties – even if the ransom has already been paid.\n\nOne threat that few organizations have considered is the prospect of sanctions violations. If your organization is the victim of a ransomware attack and faced with the question of whether to pay a ransom, it is at risk of a violation if the attacker is affiliated with a sanctioned state such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, or even a sanctioned criminal group. Sanctions compliance requires clearly knowing the attacking entity and carrying out due diligence on that entity prior to payment, but in cyberspace, it is often difficult to know who you are dealing with.\n\nPreparing for a Potential Cyber Attack\n\nWith increased risks and regulatory concerns, organizations need to prepare for when a cyberattack will happen, not if it will happen. In the past, cyberattacks could be handled internally and largely by the IT organization, but the sophistication and severity of today’s attacks now make this impossible. Organizations need to have an integrated plan that takes into account the many lines of responsibility and stakeholders involved in the event of an attack.\n\nCritical aspects of this plan should include assessing and monitoring a constantly changing cyber threat landscape. This informs decision-making and helps to ensure security and technology spending are proportionate to the unique threats that every organization faces. Knowing your potential adversaries, or at least scenario planning the intent and capability of potential threat actors to target your organization – including the likely intrusion points – is crucial. It helps to build a robust control environment. It also informs the operational response when the inevitable does happen, including decisions around whether to facilitate a crypto-currency payment.\n\nWhile the cyber risks for organizations continue to increase, U.S. companies have taken a more proactive approach to cyber risk management. The governance of cybersecurity is no longer solely an IT-department responsibility, and business leaders recognize cyber attacks as a major risk for their organizations. By identifying how cyber and ransomware attacks have shifted, understanding the organizational risks that could take place if a breach occurs, and developing a plan of action to respond to a potential attack, organizations will be best positioned for success.\n\nAbout the author:: James Owen is the Global Head of Cyber Security at Control Risks, overseeing the threat intelligence, cyber risk consulting and cyber response teams in EMEA, Asia and the Americas.

This obviously varies on a program-by-program and company-by-company basis. What a $40 billion financial services organization and a $500 million manufacturing organization view as ROI when it comes to security is certain to vary.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, however, both of those organizations are looking to reduce and manage their risk. The fundamental goal, despite wildly different budgets and maturity levels, is the same.\n\nHow can we do that?\n\nBy transforming where data lives.\n\nBy implementing asset (devices or data sources) management.\n\nBy implementing new frameworks, such as zero trust or MXDR.\n\nBut those are costs, right? How does that improve security value? Because we can measure the data, and we can report on it and the associated metrics. If you can feel more comfortable with your security program, great, but if you can\'t measure it or see results, then how do you know? You have to be able to validate your programs via monitoring and data detection.\n\nExamples of these metrics can be in many forms. From a reactive perspective, we\'re talking about things such as total number of security incidents over time by type; mean time to detect (MTTD); mean time to resolve (MTTR); intrusion attempts over time; and number of unidentified devices on network.\n\nFrom there, we lean into what I call "proactive metrics." These are metrics established to gauge how well training and vulnerability management are performing. For example, phishing test success rate; security awareness completion rate; average number of days to patch; percentage of fully patched devices on network; and number of security incidents reported by staff.\n\nToo often, we get caught in the "shiny object" issue, where we expect everything new to deliver in the exact way we want it — and this goes for technology products too. Rarely, if ever, can a technology product alone deliver a holistic ROI.\n\nIf security leaders are focused on visibility and reporting on what their teams can discover, they can demonstrate to company leadership and boards that their organization can quickly detect and respond to potential threats with people, process, and technology and rapidly re-establish business normalcy.', 'image': 'https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt66983808af36a8ef/blt13f7d94faa9ac230/60b1e7155d34de550780a946/Data_Value-NicoElNino-adobe.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:40'}

In fact, organizations were focused mostly on ensuring business continuity and avoiding any disruptions to productivity.\n\nAs the pandemic continued, investments in tech became long-term, with the focus on providing seamless and agile working operations. Companies adopted newer technologies to remain relevant. However, there was one problem, cybersecurity remained an afterthought.\n\nTrue enough, the last two years have seen a huge increase in cyberattacks targeting organizations without proper cybersecurity protection. Most of the cyberattacks targeted remote working employees, who were working using unsecured devices and networks.\n\nSupporting this is a global report released by CyberArk that showed cybersecurity taking a back seat in the last year in favor of accelerating other business initiatives. In Singapore, a whopping 82% of senior security professionals have even agreed to this.\n\nThe CyberArk 2022 Identity Security Threat Landscape Report identified how the rise of human and machine identities, often running into the hundreds of thousands per organization, has driven a buildup of identity-related cybersecurity “debt”, exposing organizations to greater cybersecurity risk.\n\nThe report which represented the findings of 1,750 IT security decision-makers, highlighted their experiences over the past year in supporting their organizations’ expanding digital initiatives. Respondents were based in the US, UK, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, Singapore, and Australia.\n\nAccording to the report, secular trends of digital transformation, cloud migration, and attacker innovation are expanding the attack surface. The report delves into the prevalence and type of cyber threats facing security teams and areas where they see elevated risk.\n\nInterestingly, credential access was the number one area of risk for respondents (at 43%), followed by defense evasion (41%), persistence (33%), privilege escalation (32%), and execution (31%). Almost 80% of local organizations surveyed have also experienced ransomware attacks in the past year, two each on average.\n\n78% of local respondents indicated that their organization is susceptible to carefully crafted attacks such as a tailored phishing email to an individual with high levels of access while 69% have done nothing to secure their software supply chain post the SolarWinds attack and most (70%) admit a compromise of a software supplier would mean an attack on their organization could not be stopped.\n\nThe cybersecurity debt\n\nFor Teck Wee Lim, Head of ASEAN at CyberArk, even as warnings of cyber threats such as ransomware and supply chain perpetuate the news, the research has shown that cybersecurity is not a top focus for many organizations.\n\n“As Singapore eases its Covid-19 restrictions and resumes more economic and social activities, organizations here need to further enhance their cyber resiliency by adopting proactive cybersecurity strategies such as Identity Security controls based on Zero Trust principles to ensure that both human and machine identities are protected,” commented Lim.\n\nGiven the increased use of technology, a poor cybersecurity framework could lead to increased risks for the organization. Security professionals agree that recent organization-wide digital initiatives have come at a price. This price is Cybersecurity Debt, whereby security programs and tools have grown but not kept pace with what organizations have put in place to drive operations and support growth. This debt has arisen through not properly managing and securing access to sensitive data and assets, and a lack of Identity Security controls is driving up risk and creating consequences.\n\n“The past few years have seen spending on digital transformation projects skyrocket to meet the demands of changed customer and workforce requirements. The combination of an expanding attack surface, rising numbers of identities, and behind-the-curve investment in cybersecurity – what we call Cybersecurity Debt – is exposing organizations to even greater risk, which is already elevated by ransomware threats and vulnerabilities across the software supply chain. This threat environment requires a security-first approach to protecting identities, one capable of outpacing attacker innovation,” explained Udi Mokady, founder, chairman, and CEO, CyberArk.\n\nThe debt is compounded by the recent rise in geopolitical tensions, which have already had a direct impact on critical infrastructure, highlighting the need for heightened awareness of the physical consequences of cyberattacks. This is why 82% agree that their organization prioritized maintaining business operations over ensuring robust cyber security in the last 12 months.\n\nAs such, to deal with this, businesses need to push for more transparency. Organizations should also introduce strategies to manage sensitive access, especially for their remote and hybrid workers. This includes prioritizing identity security controls to enforce zero trust principles. With zero trust, businesses can have the added visibility needed in securing their organization, especially in workload security, identity security tools, and data security.', 'image': 'https://techwireasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/shutterstock_1929254936-1024x683.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:55'}

These attacks are becoming increasingly common, not to mention costly for both the companies and the economies in which they occur. Are things set to get worse?\n\nThe most recent spate of supply chain attacks started gaining attention in 2020 with the SolarWinds attack, which many consider one of the most damaging attacks in recent times. With SolarWinds having over 300,000 customers, including the US federal government and most of the Fortune 500 companies, the significance of this attack cannot be overstated. In May of last year, a ransomware attack on the IT systems controlling the Colonial Pipeline created a stir when it forced the company to suspend all pipeline operations to contain the threat. Adding to the stew, researchers have discovered nearly half of the open-source libraries in the Python Package Index (a critical link in the global software supply chain) are riddled with “software weaknesses that may lead to concrete software vulnerabilities.” Supply chains are clearly vulnerable.\n\nWhile many of these attacks have focused on software vulnerabilities, potentially a more powerful, harder to detect, and more pernicious attack vector is in the hardware supply chain for the IT products themselves - an issue that is not as widely discussed as it should be. These recent attacks have exposed many of the fragile systems that currently run our world, bringing new attention to whether nations have sovereign resilience built into their country’s critical technology infrastructure. The stark reality is that most countries don’t. Virtually every country today relies on opaquely made, foreign-manufactured chips and hardware sub-assemblies, most often built in China.\n\nA Trend Toward Sovereign Resilience\n\nThese dependencies, which have become unavoidable, are starting to raise concerns among policymakers. In a recent talk at the Global Emerging Technology Summit, the US Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo lamented that zero percent of leading-edge chips are made in America right now. She called it a national security risk. Similar concerns erupted last month after an announcement that Chinese-owned Nexperia was acquiring the Newport Wafer Fab, the largest chip producer in the United Kingdom. Concerns over the sale caused Prime Minister Boris Johnson to order a security review of the deal, signaling that the UK government might block the sale.\n\nIn all of this, new trends are emerging that appear poised to take prominence in the effort to secure the IT supply lines of the world. The first is the rise in concerns over sovereign resilience, as demonstrated by the examples mentioned above. This trend is further underlined by an executive order by President Biden earlier this year that directed a broad review of critical supply chains. The goal of the study, it was said, was to produce a long-term plan to address supply chain problems. Likewise, Australia has been moving in this direction for the last few years, launching its Defense Industrial Capability Plan. This plan provides grants to ensure Australia’s defense industry has the “capability, posture, and resilience” to meet Australia’s defense needs over the next decade. Sovereign resilience is becoming a subject of intense focus for national governments.\n\nThe Problem with “Zero Trust” as a Strategy\n\nAn emerging security strategy, now gaining widespread acceptance, is that of “Zero Trust.” Microsoft recently revealed that in a survey of 1,200 security decision-makers, a full 96% of them consider Zero Trust to be critical to their organization. What’s more, the Biden Administration has ordered all US agencies to move to a Zero Trust security model by mid-November. Zero Trust has quickly become a clear path forward.\n\nThe Zero Trust concept acknowledges what our company, SoftIron, has recognized as a founding principle: reliance on trust as a foundation for security is a fundamental vulnerability. The popular concept of Zero Trust is network-based, pertaining to the question of who and what can be trusted within the firewall. It does not, however, apply the same question to the hardware that the network itself runs on. What good is a Zero Trust architecture if employed on hardware that is implicitly “trusted” not to be compromised?\n\nZero Trust, Resilience, and IT Manufacturing - Putting the Pieces Together\n\nThis question brings us back to the manufacturing issue and sovereign resilience. SoftIron’s “Edge Manufacturing,” combines open-source technologies with local manufacturing to enable a new model for competitive domestic IT manufacturing. This approach enables us to produce a truly Zero Trust hardware offering by allowing customers to audit the hardware, software, and manufacturing of our products at a component and source-code level before installing them operationally. Most IT consumers aren’t aware (because, frankly, they don’t think to ask) that virtually no other vendor will allow customers to audit source code. So much for Zero Trust.\n\nThe bottom line is that sovereign resilience can only be reliably achieved by building on Zero Trust principles that extend to the hardware level. While the current paradigm has relied heavily on cheaply produced Chinese components, countries can establish locally sourced technology supply chains that are both performant and competitive. Many technology manufacturing vendors are starting to talk in the right direction, but it is up to procurement experts to turn up the heat. This begins by applying Zero Trust principles to hardware acquisition processes and asking the right questions about component sourcing from the outset.\n\nIn the end, however, remember that it’s not the source that matters, but what is in the box. The goal is always to install clean, effective hardware into your racks – not to boast about where your hardware was (or wasn’t) made. To get there, trust ultimately needs to be replaced with transparency and auditability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author: Phil Straw is the technical visionary co-founder behind SoftIron, Phil initially served as the company’s CTO before stepping into the role as CEO.

As per IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021, the data breach costs rose by 10% on average, year-over-year, from\n\nREDACTED in 2020 to REDACTED in 2021. In addition, the remoteworking and digital transformation due to the COVID-19 pandemic increased the average total cost of a data breach to REDACTED.\n\n\n\nThe advances in various technologies such as cloud computing,wireless, bring yourown device (BYOD), telemedicine, the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and others have created a newavenue for dangerous cyberattacks and other internet-based threats. This has increased the need forend-user organizations and technology service providers to implement robust securitymeasures.With the rise of cybercrime, systematic crime, and the risk of data loss and hacking, cybersecurity has become a necessity for businesses. Cybersecurity is the process of protecting internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data fromcyberattacks. Security,which is designed tomaintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, is a subset of cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nCyberattacks can be extremely expensive forbusinesses to endure.In addition to financial damage suffered by the business, adata breach can also inflict untold reputational damage.\n\n\n\nAccording to Cybercrime Magazine, cybercrime will cost the world REDACTED annually by 2025.Furthermore, global cybercrime costs are predicted to rise by almost REDACTED yearly over the next four years.\n\n\n\nConcepts such as the pandemic, cryptocurrency and the rise in remoteworking are coming together to create a target-rich environment forcriminals to take advantage of. Regulations such as the GeneralData Protection Regulation (GDPR) areforcing organizations to take better care of the personalda ta an individual holds.\n\nRead the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p04316851/?utm_source=GNW\n\n\n\nAbout Reportlinker\n\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Ransomware group Conti has stolen at least a terabyte of data, and having seen its demands for $10m ransom rebuffed, today stated it has released 80% of the information onto the dark web. The Costa Rican government has so far stood firm in the face of the ransom demand, despite damages from the incident now reportedly running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. The incident could be the first indicator that Russian-backed gangs like Conti are embarking on a new wave of attacks.\n\nOutgoing Costa Rica president Carlos Alvarado says a recent cyberattack is aimed at destabilising the country. (Photo by HANNAH MCKAY/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCosta Rica cyberattack hits multiple government departments\n\nA breach of Costa Rica’s tax and customs administration systems took place last weekend. The country’s finance ministry was the first department hit by hackers, who have subsequently attacked its social security agency’s human resources system and the Ministry of Labor. So far a total of six public institutions have been hit.\n\nFinance minister Elian Villegas said one terabyte of information from the Central American nation’s customs directorate, which handles checks on imports and exports, had been stolen, including information on taxpayers. “Apart from that I am not aware of any other information that may have been extracted,” Villegas told Reuters.\n\nThe Costa Rican government has not yet confirmed the attack’s origin, but Conti has taken credit. A blog post from the group reads: “We will continue to attack the ministries of Costa Rica until its government pays us. Attacks continue today. We downloaded one [terabyte] of your portal databases as well as internal documents, we will start publishing this data on April 23.”\n\nRelated\n\nCosta Rica’s government is adamant that it will not pay the ransom. “We are not in a position to pay,” Villegas said. “We are a public entity, we cannot access this type of request, from the principle of legality I am not authorised for any payment of this type.”\n\nThe incident has already caused serious damage due to disruption of the country’s tax and customs platforms. The country’s exporters union said there had been losses of $200m last Wednesday alone, Reuters reports. The government website and other internal systems remain offline at the time of writing.\n\nShould Costa Rica pay the Conti ransom?\n\nCosta Rica is in the process of changing president, with outgoing Premier Carlos Alvarado saying the attacks are aimed at destabilising the Central American country as it transitions to the new government of president-elect, Rodrigo Chaves.\n\n“This attack is not an issue of money, but seeks to threaten the stability of the country in a situation of transition. They will not achieve this,” Alvarado says. Chaves assumes power on May 8.\n\nRegardless of mounting costs, Costa Rica should still resist caving in and paying the ransom, says Max Heinemeyer, VP of cyber innovation at security company Darktrace. “Once the damage is done, paying will not guarantee that the problem goes away – for example, the decryption key might not work and a lot of systems might still have to be rebuilt from scratch,” he says.\n\nData, insights and analysis delivered to you View all newsletters By The Tech Monitor team Sign up to our newsletters Sign up here\n\nHeinemeyer continues: “The recovery work itself, regardless of decryption keys being delivered, can take weeks or months and can be a very costly process. Even if the ransom is paid, there is no guarantee that the stolen data will actually be erased – you’d have to trust the word of the criminals who just breached you.”\n\nIs a new Russia-backed wave of cyberattacks imminent?\n\nThe attack coincided with a warning from the Five Eyes security alliance, which includes the UK and US, about the potential for escalating Russian cybercrime activity. Jason Steer, CISO at security company Recorded Future, says the two could be linked. “The timing of that release last week is very interesting,” Steer says. “There’s no compelling reason for it to happen, last week there wasn’t a big vulnerability or anything else. To me that timing stands out.”\n\nHe adds: “We could be turning a corner where we’ve got Russian ransomware groups potentially in a new wave of targeting Western countries and organisations. It could get really bad.”', 'image': 'https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/GettyImages-1236293594.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:01'}

Such attacks are quite often deployed to steal cryptocurrency.\n\nKrebs, an independent investigative journalist, reported that the gang used its leverage to access T-Mobile’s customer management tool, Atlas, and from there attempted to access accounts associated with US government bodies and agencies, including the FBI. This prompted arguments between members worried they had gone too far, which seems to have resulted in the group’s ringleader, who went by the handle White, pivoting to steal source code instead.\n\nThe leaked chat logs also reveal insight into the mindset of the teenagers who made up the gang, with one, going by the handle mox, expressing displeasure that his school was abuzz with talk about Lapsus$ but that he could not tell anybody he was involved.\n\nAnother gang member using the handle Amtrak was seen asking White to obscure T-Mobile’s information because his parents knew that he had engaged in SIM-swapping in the past, and didn’t want to get in trouble.\n\nFurther evidence contained in the gang’s chat logs indicates that Amtrak was bullied and later doxed by White. The gang seems to have been riven with infighting, which may ultimately have contributed to its downfall.\n\nLearn more about Lapsus$ City of London Police have charged two teenagers in connection with the Lapsus$ cyber crime spree.\n\nThe arrests of seven people in connection with the Lapsus$ cyber crime group has not dented the gang’s enthusiasm for causing chaos.\n\nSearchSecurity’s Risk & Repeat podcast examines two high-profile breaches by emerging threat group Lapsus$ and how Microsoft and Okta responded to these attacks.\n\nWhite is thought to be one of two teenagers charged over the Lapsus$ hacking spree by City of London Police, although this has not been and cannot be formally confirmed due to their age.\n\nIn a statement circulated to the media, a spokesperson for T-Mobile’s US operation said: “Several weeks ago, our monitoring tools detected a bad actor using stolen credentials to access internal systems that house operational tools software.\n\n“The systems accessed contained no customer or government information or other similarly sensitive information, and we have no evidence the intruder was able to obtain anything of value. Our systems and processes worked as designed, the intrusion was rapidly shut down and closed off, and the compromised credentials used were rendered obsolete.”\n\nThe attack on T-Mobile is not thought to have had any impact on the organisation’s former UK operation, which was folded into the EE mobile network over a decade ago, and now has no meaningful relationship with its former parent, Deutsche Telekom, which does however hold a stake in EE’s current owners, BT.\n\nLapsus$ shot to prominence in early 2022, thanks to a series of high-profile attacks on tech companies including Nvidia, Samsung, Ubisoft, Okta and Microsoft. The gang was mistakenly thought to be a ransomware gang at first, but it does not appear to have ever deployed ransomware at any of its targets, preferring instead to simply exfiltrate and leak data while demanding a pay-off, as opposed to encrypting it.', 'image': 'https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/German/article/data-leak-breach-2-adobe.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:44'}

The product will be available to employers in Fidelity’s 401(k) lineup by mid-year, the company said.\n\nWith so much focus on digital assets lately, and investors already utilizing these options outside of retirement plans for years, the time was right, said Dave Gray, head of workplace retirement platforms and offerings at Fidelity Investments. “Investors’ expectations and interest in digital assets like bitcoin and others, even outside retirement accounts – that interest continues to grow,” Gray said.\n\nThese investments are becoming more “baked into the financial system of today and the future” – for trading as well as payments, he added.\n\nSee: Does bitcoin belong with your 401(k)?\n\nIn just a few years’ time, the number of investors dabbling in cryptocurrencies has grown substantially. About 8% of households used crypto in 2020, but that figure jumped to 22% in 2021, representing 25 million households, according to research firm Hearts & Wallets. About 22% use cryptocurrencies for payments, 66% for trading and 12% for both – a clear indication of the interest in digital assets as investments, said Laura Varas, chief executive officer of Hearts & Wallets.\n\nIn the research, investors said they used cryptocurrencies because the “high volatility creates opportunities to make money trading.” Younger investors, and male investors, are more likely to use cryptocurrencies than their older, or female, counterparts, the data showed.\n\n“Consumers are doing this anyway,” Varas said. “So it is positive that they’re going to be helped to do it in a safe way.”\n\nFidelity is establishing a limit on how much of a 401(k) plan can be invested in bitcoin – no more than 20%. Employers will then be able to adjust that limit, perhaps choosing 5% or 10%, but no more than 20%, Gray said. Investors can use cryptocurrencies in their 401(k) plan through a Digital Assets Account, which holds bitcoin and other short-term money market investments, Fidelity said.\n\nCryptocurrencies in employer-sponsored retirement accounts, such as the 401(k) plan, are still relatively new, and the Department of Labor, which oversees employers’ retirement plans, has issued a warning in offering them. Employers are held to the fiduciary standard as plan sponsors, which means they must act in their employees’ best interests when choosing which investments to include in their 401(k) plans. The evaluation includes core investment earnings, higher-than-necessary expense ratios and fees and what constitutes as “unreasonably risky,” said Wendy Von Wald, fiduciary product manager at Travelers.\n\nAlso see: Bitcoin unable to hold gains as Fidelity plans to let investors put the crypto in 401(k) accounts\n\n“Especially with cryptocurrency, there would have to be an additional level of scrutiny,” Von Wald said.\n\nIn March, the DOL told 401(k) plan sponsors to exercise caution when including cryptocurrencies in their 401(k) plans. “Today’s announcement reminds plan fiduciaries of their important role in selecting investment options for 401(k) plan menus,” Ali Khawar, acting assistant secretary of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, said at the time. “At this stage of cryptocurrency’s development, fiduciaries must exercise extreme care before including direct investment options in cryptocurrencies.”\n\nStill, investors are taking digital assets more seriously – and some want these investments in their retirement accounts. There are already platforms that provide access to cryptocurrencies in IRAs, for example.\n\nMany financial advisers have said if investors do opt to put a portion of their portfolio into these assets, they should do so carefully and with the expectation that they may lose the money (one reason why some people might decide against using their retirement savings to invest in this).

With the new program, planned to launch later this year, Fidelity could become the first major retirement-plan provider to let savers to invest in Bitcoin via their retirement accounts.\n\nHowever, Fidelity’s new program is not without criticism. The U.S. Labor Department, which regulates company-sponsored retirement plans, published a directive on Mar. 10 raising “serious concerns” over the idea of exposing 401(k) participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies. “Extreme volatility can have a devastating impact on participants, especially those approaching retirement and those with substantial allocations to cryptocurrency,” the regulator said, further citing valuation, custody, record keeping, and regulatory concerns.\n\nFidelity is estimated to have had around $2.4 trillion in 401(k) assets in 2020, accounting for more than a third of the market for company-sponsored retirement accounts.

When you look up an app on the Play Store, alongside sections like "About this app" and "ratings and reviews," there will be a new section called "Data privacy & security," where developers can explain what data they collect. Google showed off this feature last year, and it will finally start appearing in the Play Store today.\n\nNote that while the section will be appearing for users starting today, it might not be filled out by developers. Google\'s deadline for developers to provide privacy information is July 20. Even then, all of this privacy information is provided by the developer and is essentially working on the honor system. Here\'s how Google describes the process to developers:\n\nYou alone are responsible for making complete and accurate declarations in your app’s store listing on Google Play. Google Play reviews apps across all policy requirements; however, we cannot make determinations on behalf of the developers of how they handle user data. Only you possess all the information required to complete the Data safety form. When Google becomes aware of a discrepancy between your app behavior and your declaration, we may take appropriate action, including enforcement action.\n\nOnce the section is up and running, developers will be expected to list what data they\'re collecting, why they\'re collecting it, and who they\'re sharing it with. The support page features a big list of data types for elements like "location," "personal info," "financial info," "web history," "contacts," and various file types. Developers are expected to list their data security practices, including explaining if data is encrypted in transit and if users can ask for data to be deleted. There\'s also a spot for "Google Play’s Families Policy" compliance, which is mostly just a bunch of US COPPA and EU GDPR requirements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle says developers can also indicate if their app has "been independently validated against a global security standard." Google has a " Mobile Application Security Assessment " standard, and developers can pay between $3,000 and $6,000 to have a "Google Authorized Lab partner" audit an app against this standard. This audit includes a review of an app\'s encryption practices, a check for known vulnerabilities, a requirement of minimum permissions, and a bunch of other tests listed on this Github.\n\nAs usual, Google\'s release process can take a while. Google says a lucky few users will start seeing the data safety section today, and it will probably take a few weeks to roll out to everyone.\n\nListing image by Google', 'image': 'https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-get-ready-to-sumbit-your-data-safety-secton-social-760x380.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:45'}

Currently, when you install an app, the Android OS will detail what data permissions the software needs to operate. However, Google found that both users and app developers would like to see more context around the data usage.\n\n“Users want to know for what purpose their data is being collected and whether the developer is sharing user data with third parties,” the company wrote. “In addition, users want to understand how app developers are securing user data after an app is downloaded.”\n\nThe resulting Data safety section is similar to Apple\'s "Privacy Nutrition Labels," which the company introduced in 2020.

Presumably, shady apps that fail to comply will also be delisted from the app store.\n\nHowever, the new Data safety section won’t necessarily cover every way data can be shared or collected through an app. "In some cases, developers do not need to disclose data as \'shared\' even if it\'s technically transferred to another party (for example, when you give your consent to transfer the data after the app explains how it will use the data, or when the data is shared with a developer\'s service provider)," Google\'s support page for the Data safety section notes.\n\nGoogle also doesn’t consider data collected if it was done through end-to-end encryption or if the app only pulled the data on your phone, but never transmitted it to a server. “For example, if a weather app sends your location off your device to get the current weather at your location, but the app only uses your location data in memory and does not store the data for longer than necessary to provide the weather,” the company said.', 'image': 'https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02xgoOg2xk4kHotjrw3IXMD-2.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1650989422.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:24'}

That, she said, will make for a “tough" comparison that will be compounded by Google\'s suspension of operations in Russia in protest of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut at least Google isn’t yet facing as much pressure as some other once high-flying tech companies, such as video streaming leader Netflix, which suffered its first loss of subscribers in more than a decade at the beginning of this year after reveling in meteoric growth at the pandemic’s outset.\n\nIn an effort to regain its lost momentum, Netflix plans to crack down on subscribers who have been sharing their passwords with freeloading viewers and may start showing ads on a lower-priced version of its service for the first time.', 'image': '/static/img/wln_alt.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:05'}

Twenty-seven bugs were recognized as “critical severity” flaws.\n\nThe Hack DHS initiative saw more than 450 security researchers participate in the program. For their efforts, the government agency paid out a total reward of $125,600 that was distributed amongst the ethical hackers.\n\nAs aptly highlighted by The Register, the aforementioned payout figure pales in comparison to what other organizations pay to bug bounty hunters.\n\nFor example, Intel has previously offered up to $100,000 for successfully uncovering specific vulnerabilities.\n\nOther technology giants like Microsoft offer 10s of thousands of dollars for finding flaws, while Apple paid a single individual nearly the entirety of the Hack DHS bounty by giving him $100,000 for hacking a Mac.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, has awarded nearly $30 million to individuals enrolled in its own bug bounty programs. In one particular case, the company gave a self-taught teenage hacker $36,000 for reporting a certain bug.\n\nConsidering the fact that one of the Department of Homeland Security’s key responsibilities involves cyber security, many may understandably be concerned that such a high amount of security bugs were found in the first place. Moreover, the somewhat lackluster payment tiers associated with Hack DHS could be a potential deterrent to future interested parties.\n\nAll things considered, it seems the DHS is not as secure as many Americans would have hoped it would be.\n\nHomeland Security’s quest to become more secure\n\nHack DHS was originally introduced in December 2021. Any hacker who joined the program would have to provide a comprehensive breakdown of any vulnerability they find. They also have to detail how that flaw can be targeted and exploited by potential threat actors, as well as explain how it can be specifically utilized to access and extract data from DHS systems.\n\nOnce these security defects are put through a verification process by “DHS security experts,” which takes 48 hours to analyze after a bug is detected and submitted, they are generally patched within 15 days or so. In some cases, it takes the government agency longer than half a month to fix the more intricate flaws.\n\nThe government agency’s bug bounty program will be conducted via a tiered rollout consisting of three stages. The first phase, payouts, has been completed, while the upcoming second stage will see security researchers hand-picked by the DHS taking part in a live hacking event.\n\nAs for the final phase, The Register reports that DHS will share information that it hopes will influence additional bug bounty programs.\n\nThe popularity of bug bounty programs is increasingly becoming more prominent in an era where cybercriminals have been intensifying their attempts to infiltrate major companies, especially in the technology space.\n\nFor example, Intel unveiled Project Circuit Breaker, an expansion to its bug bounty program that was introduced to recruit “elite hackers.” Google also updated its Vulnerability Reward Program last year by launching a new bug platform.\n\nElsewhere, Google recently confirmed that a record number of dangerous zero-day exploits were identified in 2021, while cybercrimes are more widespread than ever before.\n\nEditors' Recommendations", 'image': 'https://icdn.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/security-breach-warning-in-big-monitor-displaying-cloud-security-hacker-attack-on-cloud-security-system-shield.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:41'}

Here’s today’s news.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – FIGHTING\n\nRussia has made small advances after beginning to focus on the full occupation of the Donbas region, but the lack of resources and combat support is making it hard for the Russian troops to occupy the region, the U.K. Defense Ministry has said in an intelligence update. Russia’s Ministry of Defense has proposed that the military handle payments to families of deceased soldiers, suggesting that Russia is trying to hide the extensive war losses from its own population, the update added. Ayumi Fujimoto reports for NBC News.\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine came under Russian fire this morning, delaying train services, Oleksandr Kamyshim chairman of Ukrainian Railways said in a Telegram post. Julian Duplain reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussia has said that it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 96 miles northeast of the border with Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 local time (1800 EST) and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people. Reuters reports.\n\nNine Russian missiles struck infrastructure in Kremenchuk, an industrial city in central Ukraine, yesterday according to a regional leader. “The enemy does not shy away from anything, even on such a holy day,” Dmytro Lunin, an acting governor and head of the Poltava region’s military administration, wrote on Telegram. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussian attacks targeting the towns of Gorske and Zolote in the eastern Luhansk region killed six people on Saturday, the region’s governor, Sergiy Haida has said. Cora Engelbrecht reports for the New York Times.\n\nA series of artillery strikes hit central and east Kharkiv on Saturday, including a large residential area. There were no casualties in the strike on central Kharkiv, officials said. Thomas Gibbons-Neff reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussia is planning a staged referendum in the Ukrainian city of Kherson to justify “its occupation,” according to the U.K.’s Defense Ministry. “The city is key to Russia’s objective of establishing a land bridge to Crimea and dominating southern Ukraine,” the ministry tweeted in an intelligence update. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – MARIUPOL\n\nUkrainian forces are still in full control of the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol and have repelled continuous assaults by Russian infantry, Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Battalion, said yesterday. Ukrainian forces are willing to leave the factory and evacuate the city if given guarantees of safe passage for themselves and hundreds of civilians, Palamar said. Michael Schwirtz reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussian troops may be preparing for a renewed assault on the Azovstal steel plant, according to an update by Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War. BBC News reports.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross issued a statement yesterday saying that it was “deeply alarmed” by the situation in Mariupol. The statement called for unimpeded access to help residents, including hundreds of wounded. Marc Santora and Austin Ramzy report for the New York Times.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – U.S. RESPONSE\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said during an unannounced trip to Kyiv on Sunday that U.S. diplomats would return to Ukraine this week. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to the Ukrainian capital, where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials, making them the highest-level US officials to have traveled to the country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hanlser report for CNN.\n\nBridget Brink, who is currently the ambassador to Slovakia, is expected to be named as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine – a position that has been left vacant since early 2020 under former President Trump’s administration. President Joe Biden will likely nominate her later today. María Paúl and Missy Ryan report for the Washington Post.\n\nAt the meeting in Kyiv, the U.S. pledged more than $700m in military financing to help Ukraine’s war efforts, officials have said. About half of the money will go to Ukraine, while the rest will be split among NATO members and other regional allies. In addition, the US will sell $165m of ammunition to Ukraine. BBC News reports.\n\nRussia is failing in its war aims but Ukraine is succeeding, Blinken said following his and Austin’s meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Reuters reports.\n\nThe United States hopes the war in Ukraine will result in a “weakened” Russia that no longer has the capacity to invade its neighbors, Austin told reporters during his trip to Kyiv. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said. Annabelle Timsit and Julie Yoon report for the Washington Post.\n\nZelenskyy has thanked the US for its “unprecedented” support for Ukraine, following his meeting with Blinken and Austin yesterday. “We appreciate the unprecedented assistance of the United States to Ukraine. I would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, for his personal clear position. To thank all the American people, as well as the Congress for their bicameral and bipartisan support. We see it. We feel it,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukraine’s presidential website reports.\n\nAlina Kabaeva, the woman the U.S. government believes to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend, has been spared sanctions in a last-minute decision. U.S. officials believe that sanctioning Kabaeva would be deemed so personal a blow to Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the U.S.. Vivian Salama, Joe Parkinson and Drew Hinshaw report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMultiple governors have announced that their state National Guards would be sending armored vehicles to Ukraine in response to a request from the Pentagon. Gov. Mike DeWine (R- OH) and Gov. Jim Justice (R – WV) announced that their state National Guards would be providing an unspecified number of M-113 armored personnel carriers, which help move equipment and soldiers “while providing protection from small arms fire and the effects of artillery,” according to press releases from both governors’ offices. Caroline Vakil reports for The Hill.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – GLOBAL RESPONSE\n\nIn recent days Russian authorities have stopped publishing data on government debt, trade statistics and oil production, while lawmakers work on a bill banning lenders from sharing data with foreign states. The growing blackout is part of an effort by the Russian authorities to protect the economy and domestic companies from further sanctions by the West. Limited data means that Washington and Brussels will have less visibility on whether and how their sanctions are working. Georgi Kantchev reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTop Ukrainian officials yesterday expressed disapproval of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of the officer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told NBC in an interview that Guterres is “not really” authorized to speak on behalf of the Ukrainian government. Quint Forget reports for POLITICO.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\n\nRussia has proposed the forced donation of blood by captured Ukrainian soldiers, according to Ukrainian ombudsperson for Human Rights, Lyudmila Denisova. “This fact testifies to the analogy of the atrocities of the Nazis in the concentration camps during the Second World War,” she said in a post on Facebook. Aaron Reich reports for the Jerusalem Post.\n\nGreenpeace activists have sought to block a tanker from delivering Russian oil to Norway, chaining themselves to the vessel in a protest against the war in Ukraine. As of this morning, the Ust Luga product tanker is anchored outside Exxon Mobil’s Slagen oil terminal some 43 miles south of the capital Oslo, according to the vessel tracker Marine Traffic. “Oil is not only at the root of the climate crisis but also of wars and conflicts. I am shocked that Norway operates as a free port for Russian oil, which we know finances Putin’s warfare,” Greenpeace Norway head Frode Pleym said. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine’s postal service has said it was targeted by a cyberattack on Friday following to sale of stamps portraying a Ukrainian soldier making a crude gesture to a Russian warship. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine has asked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a list of equipment that is necessary for the reliable and safe operation of its nuclear facilities during the war. The list specifically mentions radiation measuring instruments, shielding materials, electrical power systems and diesel generators. The IAEA reports.\n\nOTHER U.S. RELATIONS\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said yesterday that the current scale of espionage and cybersecurity threats from China were “unprecedented in history.” He noted that China’s hacking program is larger “than that of every other major nation combined,” adding that China’s targets span nearly every sector of the economy. Monique Balls reports for The Hill.\n\nThe Chinese government is not only mistreating Uyghurs within China’s borders, it is hunting them down abroad with help from countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, according to a new report by the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S.. More than 5,500 Uyghurs outside of China have been targeted by Beijing, hit with cyberattacks and threats to family members who remain in China, and more than 1,500 Uyghurs have been detained or forced to return to China to face imprisonment and torture in police custody, according to the report. Anna Schecter reports for NBC News.\n\nPresident Biden yesterday issued a statement memorializing the Armenian genocide. “Let us redouble our efforts toward healing and building the better, more peaceful world that we wish for our children … A world where human rights are respected, where the evils of bigotry and intolerance do not mark our daily lives, and where people everywhere are free to pursue their lives in dignity and security,” the statement said. David Cohen reports for POLITICO.\n\nOTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nEmmanuel Macron won a second term as president of France yesterday, triumphing over his far-right challenger, Marine Le Pen. Projections at the close of voting, which are generally reliable, showed Macron gaining 58.5 per cent of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5 per cent. His victory was much narrower than in 2017 when the margin was 66.1 per cent to 33.9 per cent for Le Pen. Roger Cohen reports for the New York Times.\n\nPreliminary results for Slovenia’s parliamentary elections show that right-wing Prime Minister Janez Jansa has lost to centrist rivals. With 95 per cent of the vote counted, results indicated that Jansa’s Slovenian Democratic Party had won around 24 per cent of the vote. That is far behind the 34 per cent of its main rival, the centrist Freedom Movement, meaning that Jansa is highly unlikely to keep his post as prime minister. Andrew Higgins reports for the New York Times.\n\nIsrael yesterday closed its civilian border crossing with the Gaza Strip, preventing thousands of Gazans from getting to work in Israel, in an effort to pressure Gaza’s ruler Hamas to halt rocket attacks against southern Israel. The closure comes after Palestinian militants fired two rockets at Israel Friday night and one on Saturday morning. Dov Lieber reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHundreds of Arab militia fighters, attacked a village in Sudan’s western Darfur region yesterday, torching homes and shops and killing at least 150 people, according to aid groups and U.N. officials. The violence, which later spread to a nearby town, was the latest in a series of clashes involving Arab and ethnic African groups in Darfur in recent months. Declan Walsh reports for the New York Times.\n\nBritish man, Luke Symons, who was held captive in Yemen without charge or trial for five years has been released from jail. U.K. foreign secretary, Liz Truss, confirmed yesterday that Symons “would shortly be reunited with his family.” She thanked Omani and Saudi negotiators as well as U.K. Foreign Office staff as he was released alongside 13 other foreign nationals in Yemen. Joe Middleton reports for the Guardian.\n\nThree policemen were killed in central Nigeria’s Kogi state on Saturday after gunmen stormed a police station in an attack claimed by Islamic State. The attack came a day after explosives planted at a bar in northeast Nigeria injured 11 people. Anna MacSwan reports for the Guardian.\n\nHealth authorities in the Democratic Republic and Congo have declared a new outbreak of Ebola, the Work Health organisation reported yesterday. So far, just one case has been confirmed and investigations to determine the source of the outbreak are ongoing. U.N. News Centre reports.\n\nSaudi princes have sold more than $600 million worth of real estate, yachts and artwork in the U.S. and Europe since the kingdom’s de facto ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman tightened the purse strings of the ultrawealthy ruling family. The transactions represent a radical change of fortune for senior princes who funnelled windfalls from oil booms in the 1970s and 1980s into some of the world’s most exclusive markets. “They’ve clearly been cut down to a disciplined, defined regimen and are having to live on that,” said British historian Robert Lacey, who has chronicled the Saudi ruling family since the 1980s. Prince Mohammed is “here for the long term and he’s reshaping things in a long-term fashion.” Stephen Kalin reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nJAN. 6, 2021 ATTACK\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was confronted in court on Friday over past social media posts advocating violence against Democrats. At the hearing in Atlanta, to determine if Greene is constitutionally barred from running for reelection because of her alleged role in the Jan. 6 attack, the congressperson repeatedly said she couldn’t remember past comments or interactions. Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck report for CNN.\n\nOTHER DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS\n\nTwitter Inc. is in discussions to sell itself to Elon Musk and could finalize a deal as soon as this week. The two sides met Sunday to discuss Musk’s proposal and were making progress, according to sources familiar with the matter. However, there is no guarantee they will reach a deal. Cara Lombardo and Dana Cimilluca report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nA U.S. Air Force general officer has been found guilty of abusive sexual contact, in the first-ever court-martial trial and conviction of a general officer in the history of the military branch. Maj. Gen. William T. Cooley was found guilty on one of three specifications of sexual assault connected to a 2018 incident in New Mexico, the Air Force said in a statement. Aaron Pellish reports for CNN.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments today in the case of Joseph Kennedy – a Washington state high school football coach who lost his job after he refused to stop praying on the field immediately after games. “There is good reason to think that its newly expanded conservative majority will not only rule in Kennedy’s favor but also make a major statement about the role religion may play in public life,” Adam Liptak reports for the New York Times.\n\nThis morning a judge will consider whether to hold former President Trump in contempt for violating a court order that he comply with a subpoena regarding a civil investigation into his business practices. New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is asking a state court judge to fine Trump $10,000 for each day that he has failed to turn over documents relevant to the subpoena. Harper Neidig reports for The Hill.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray yesterday highlighted an increase in violence against police officers last year, including a jump in police murders. “Violence against law enforcement in this country is one of the biggest phenomena that I think doesn’t get enough attention,” Wray said in an interview, adding that in 2021, “officers were being killed at a rate of almost one every five days.” Monique Beals reports for The Hill.\n\nA Colorado man who set himself on fire in front of the Supreme Court on Friday in an apparent Earth Day protest against climate change has died. The Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C., said that Wynn Bruce, 50, of Boulder, Colo., died on Saturday from his injuries after being airlifted to a hospital following the incident. Chris Cameron reports for the New York Times.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 has infected over 80.98 million people and has now killed over 991.254 people in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Globally, there have been over 507.56 million confirmed coronavirus cases and over 6.21 million deaths.

Asked on Russian state television about the possibility of nuclear war, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, “The danger is serious, real,” while accusing NATO of waging a proxy war on Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, the war seems to be spreading to Moldova; explosions in the breakaway region of Transdniester destroyed radio transmitter antennas today after unknown attackers fired on the territory’s state security ministry with a grenade launcher yesterday, The Guardian reported. Gaining access to Transdniester is a stated goal of Russia’s new offensive, and today the leader of the self-proclaimed and Russian-occupied Donetsk People’s Republic told media that Moscow should “take into account what is happening in [Transdniester]” in upcoming war plans.\n\nMore context: Moscow is planning to stage a referendum in Ukraine’s Kherson region for local residents to vote on the supposed “independence” of a new government entity called the Kherson People’s Republic, according to the mayor, RFE/RL reports. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called any such referendum a “sham.”\n\nWorth noting: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres visited Moscow today and spoke to Lavrov about the need “to end the war as soon as possible,” France24 reports. Guterres planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin later today and will go to Ukraine to meet Zelenskiy tomorrow. The United States announced a new military support package for Ukraine, NPR says. Germany is sending tanks to Ukraine; Berlin was previously criticized for not sending heavy weapons.\n\nNews from the Regions\n\nCentral Europe and the Baltics\n\nTwo mine accidents in one week have killed at least 12 people in southern Poland, Euronews reports. At least six miners died and four are missing after an accident on Saturday – possibly caused by a methane gas discharge after a minor earthquake – at the Borynia-Zofiowka mine near the Czech border. Explosions at the Pniowek mine on 20 April also killed six.\n\nSlovakia is considering mining for uranium to reduce its dependency on Russian supplies, Economy Minister Richard Sulík said, according to Euractiv. Uranium for the country’s four-reactor Mochovce nuclear plantcurrently comes from Russia’s TVEL, a subsidiary of state-owned giant Rosatom. Mining at Slovakia’s two main uranium deposits in the country’s east would have to be approved by voters in nearby villages, who have not agreed to such exploration in the past.\n\nA former parliamentarian from the Czech rightwing Freedom and Direct Democracy party has been found guilty of Holocaust denial, Seznam Zpravy reports. Miloslav Rozner received a suspended sentence for calling the World War II concentration camp for Roma at Lety in South Bohemia a “non-existent pseudo-concentration camp” in 2017.\n\nAlso in the Czech Republic, police are investigating the spray-painting of “Z” symbols – representing support for Russia’s war on Ukraine – on Prague’s Petrin Hill and on a river embankment visible from the iconic Charles Bridge, CNN Prima reports. Last week, Russian hackers targeted several public and private institutions and a main government website, the Interior Ministry announced, according to Czech Radio.\n\nSoutheastern Europe\n\nThe western Balkans is “a testing ground for geostrategic rivalries” and the Russian war on Ukraine has a “serious potential to create instability,” Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Grlic Radman said recently, according to Euractiv. Speaking to the press with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Teodora Gencovska, Grlic Radman said working within NATO was key to regional stability, adding that he hoped North Macedonia and Bulgaria “will find a mutually acceptable solution which will allow North Macedonia to continue its European journey,” apparently referring to the country’s EU aspirations.\n\nEastern Europe and Russia\n\nA Ukrainian man used tracking technology to find the location of his earbuds after they were stolen by Russian soldiers, Euronews reports. Vitaliy Semenets shared mapping images on social media showing his lost items were in the Belgorod region of Russia, writing “It was looted by Russian orcs from my home in Hostomel … Thanks to technology, I know where my AirPods are now.”\n\nCentral Asia\n\nAn ethnic Kyrgyz Christian from China recently traveled to the United States to give testimony about China’s mass detention camps, according to reports in the Guardian and Eurasianet. Ovalbek Turdakun spoke at a Washington press conference on 13 April after arriving in the United States under a special visa with his wife and son. In 2018, Turdakun spent 10 months in a Xinjiang prison camp where he said he was psychologically and physically tortured. In December 2019 he crossed the border into Kyrgyzstan, but when the Kyrgyz government failed to renew his visa in December 2021, he was at risk of deportation back to China. Up to 2 million people are estimated to have been imprisoned in the Chinese camps.\n\n\n\nBorderlands\n\nA Turkish court has sentenced civil rights activist Osman Kavala to life in prison without parole on the charge of attempting to overthrow the government during mass protests in 2013, the BBC reports. The verdict is “a travesty of justice of spectacular proportions” Amnesty International said, for “everyone who believes in justice and human rights activism in Turkey and beyond.” Seven other defendants were also sentenced to 18 years in prison. Europe’s top human rights organization, the Council of Europe, has launched infringement procedures against Turkey over the case. The increasingly authoritarian leader of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has accused Kavala of being an agent of Hungarian-born U.S. billionaire George Soros, the BBC notes.\n\n…', 'image': 'https://tol.org/wp-content/uploads/12333333333333333.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:11'}

We cover the definition, statistics, and ransomware protection.\n\nEven though it ends with a ransom, ransomware attacks are a bit different from regular ransom attacks that leverage sensitive information. They include malware that attacks devices, and the ransom is mostly demanded in hackers’ preferred cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is a ransomware attack exactly, how common are ransomware attacks, how does ransomware find its way to your computer, and do you have ransomware protection? Let’s dive in and find out.\n\nWhat is a Ransomware Attack?\n\nRansomware is a type of malicious software. This malware can get into your computer, encrypt data, and withhold it until you pay the ransom. Data that is unlocked until a ransom is paid can be that of a single device or an entire network.\n\nThe victim of a ransomware attack, be it a company or an individual, has a certain time frame during which they have to pay the ransom or do what the note says. If they don’t oblige, they risk losing access to their data forever.\n\nAfter the victim pays the ransom in the demanded cryptocurrency (that is used for illegal cyber activities because it’s more difficult to trace it), hackers unlock the access to their data.\n\nOr do they?\n\nShould You Pay the Ransom?\n\nNo. You should contact authorities in your area that can take over, such as the FBI.\n\nWhy?\n\nPaying the ransom could imply you’re financing criminal activity.\n\nSo, why do most people pay the ransom?\n\nWhen it comes to ransomware, there is a high chance you’ll lose your data. For companies, this means that they might have to rebuild everything they’ve worked for from scratch.\n\nMost companies don’t want their clients to find out about the attack at all. They might risk their reputation if others find out about the hacking, and their customers might be reluctant to use their services again in the future.\n\nRansomware attacks also disrupt the workflow of an organization. As hackers withhold data, organizations might not be able to work or lose a lot of time waiting for access to the stolen information.\n\nAlso, their IT teams and cybersecurity experts have to spend their time mitigating and dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack. This might cause them to fall behind with the rest of their professional duties.\n\nThose are some of the reasons why most companies pay the price of a ransom. However, if you do pay the ransom, this doesn’t guarantee that hackers will give you access to your system or that the attack won’t happen again.\n\nRansomware Attack Statistics\n\nAccording to research, 10% of breaches include ransomware. Targets of ransomware attacks have been individuals, companies, and even critical infrastructure sectors.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline ransomware attacks that happened last year saw one of the most widely reported attacks that targeted critical infrastructure. However, CISA suggests that there have been attacks on 14 out of 16 critical infrastructures.\n\nCISA’s overall conclusion has been that there has been an increase in ransomware attacks worldwide.\n\nLast year, the number of ransom attacks doubled. The FBI reported an astonishing 2,084 complaints about ransomware.\n\nAn increase in this type of cyberattack in recent years could be attributed to widespread access to hacking methods and new vulnerabilities that have been caused by remote work.\n\nInformation about how to perform certain attacks has been available on the internet. This means that even inexperienced cyber criminals can follow directions and perform dangerous attacks.\n\nTo adapt to remote work, companies had to adjust their systems to allow remote access. As they haven’t used the systems before, they were left with flaws in the system that caused many cyber breaches at the start of the pandemic.\n\nRansomware Attack Starts with Access to Your Device\n\nSome ways that ransomware malware can find its way to your computer include:\n\nEmail phishing — if you click the link in the body of an email from an unknown sender or download a virus with the attachment\n\n— if you click the link in the body of an email from an unknown sender or download a virus with the attachment Adware — ads on the internet can contain malware and if you click it, you can download it onto your computer\n\n— ads on the internet can contain malware and if you click it, you can download it onto your computer High-risk website — by visiting an unsafe website, you can download malware on your device that encrypts your data\n\nCan You Protect Yourself from Ransomware Attacks?\n\nYes. Since it’s a kind of malware, ransomware protection tools mitigate this type of attack as with any malicious virus that finds its way to your computer. They scan, detect, and remove it before it causes further damage.\n\nSome things you can do to protect your devices from ransomware attacks are:\n\nUpdating your software — outdated software, applications, or systems can create vulnerabilities for your systems and devices.\n\n— outdated software, applications, or systems can create vulnerabilities for your systems and devices. Having trustworthy anti-malware on your computer — antivirus software that can detect ransomware and other types of malware is important for your cybersecurity.\n\n— antivirus software that can detect ransomware and other types of malware is important for your cybersecurity. Doing regular backups of your data — during malware attacks, the key leverage that hackers have over you is withholding the data.\n\nOld versions of applications and software can create flaws in your system because attacks are always changing, and new updated versions of systems are ready for new hacking methods.\n\nBackups of your data should be on an external hard drive so that you can access it even if you become a victim of a ransomware attack.\n\nPrevent Ransomware Attacks Before They Happen\n\nMost people think about ransomware when the attack has already happened. Their data is encrypted, and they’re thinking of paying the ransom to regain access to their information.\n\nPaying the ransom also doesn’t guarantee that you won’t be the victim of this type of cybercrime ever again.\n\nIf it’s not patched up after the attack, the same hackers can exploit those same flaws that they’ve found in your system to demand ransom.\n\nThe time and money that companies spend following the attacks can be a deathly blow for many businesses — especially if they’re small businesses that didn’t expect that they’ll be the victim of such an attack.\n\nMore Ransomware Topics', 'image': 'https://www.hackread.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ransomware-attacks-everything-you-need-to-know.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:06'}

He holds an MSc in Data Communications from Brunel University in London.\n\nCybercriminals are attacking corporate networks at least 50% more [1] frequently than they did in 2020. By the end of 2021, there were over 900 attacks per organization every week - an all-time high that you can bet will continue [2] throughout 2022.\n\nDigital transformation goals were already driving cloud adoption well before the pandemic. Since then, enterprises like yours have the added responsibility of providing network access to their workforce from anywhere. That means employees are using the public internet and personal devices to access business cloud applications more than ever before.\n\nAt the same time, digital investments have become mission-critical for the modern enterprise. Not only are they necessary to support your distributed workforce, they\'re also a must-have competitive advantage.\n\nBut these initiatives have introduced new challenges that IT and security departments must overcome. Your cybersecurity perimeter has expanded exponentially and put a target on your company\'s back.\n\nWhat does this mean for your enterprise? Time is running out for you to keep corporate data and critical business assets under lock and key - or, by extension, to keep an eye on the keys scattered across your network.\n\nSimply put, it\'s time to prepare for the reality of modern cybersecurity. Let\'s take a look at the threat landscape and dangers that threaten enterprises in 2022.\n\nIf there\'s anything that IT leaders can agree on, it\'s that cyber threats are a growing concern. From the time you started to read this blog, at least six new attacks [3] have occurred. In fact, for only the second time in its 10-year history, the Allianz Risk Barometer [4] - a global survey of corporate risk - has ranked cyber incidents as the most important risk to businesses in 2022.\n\nWhy? Because regardless of industry - whether it be manufacturing, healthcare, retail, or finance - corporate data is a commodity of immense value. Data has become a lucrative target for hackers to hang over your company\'s head and squeeze as much money as they can in return.\n\nAccording to IBM, the average cost of a data breach in 2021 was $4.24 million [5] - the highest sum in recorded history. For data breaches where remote work played a factor, the cost was $1 million more. Any way you look at it, this is an expense that no company can afford to pay, and certainly not on a recurring basis.\n\nData has become a lucrative target for hackers to hang over a company\'s head and squeeze as much money as they can get in return.\n\nWhen you consider the accelerating prevalence and complexity of attacks, it\'s no wonder that the cost of a single incident is growing to match. For enterprises, there\'s an entire rogue\'s gallery of threats that are a possible nightmare for IT security teams:\n\nMalware: According to McKinsey, the number of unique malware strains has increased exponentially since 2002, to over 130 million [6] . Newer, more complex types of malware are "fileless," meaning they deploy malicious code embedded in native scripting language or written directly into memory, allowing them to move laterally in the environment.\n\nAccording to McKinsey, the number of unique malware strains has increased exponentially since 2002, to over 130 million . Newer, more complex types of malware are "fileless," meaning they deploy malicious code embedded in native scripting language or written directly into memory, allowing them to move laterally in the environment. Ransomware: Globally, there were over 623 million ransomware attacks [7] around the world in 2021, triple the amount recorded just two years prior. Ransomware victims paid more than $600 million to cybercriminals in 2021.\n\n\n\nGlobally, there were over 623 million ransomware attacks around the world in 2021, triple the amount recorded just two years prior. Ransomware victims paid more than $600 million to cybercriminals in 2021. Phishing attacks: Social engineering attacks prey upon human error and target unsuspecting users across your network. Per Cisco, 90% of data breaches [8] are the result of phishing attacks.\n\nSocial engineering attacks prey upon human error and target unsuspecting users across your network. Per Cisco, 90% of data breaches are the result of phishing attacks. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): Ransom-motivated DDoS attacks increased 29% year-on-year [9] and 175% between Q3 and Q4 2021. With an explosion of connected devices and IoT technologies on your corporate network, these endpoints are a dangerous threat vector. Such devices typically lack adequate security controls - a vulnerability frequently targeted by malicious hackers.\n\nIndeed, cyberattacks are increasing in quantity, but they\'re also becoming much more daring overall. For example, take the case of SolarWinds. In 2020, an attack believed to be sponsored by Russian intelligence slipped malicious code - called an SQL injection - into SolarWinds\' Orion software and used it to launch a massive attack on at least 18,000 customers, including the U.S. government and many Fortune 500 companies. The hackers were able to infiltrate and access the networks of countless Orion users.\n\nBut SolarWinds is far from the only victim of a high-profile cyberattack in recent years. From Colonial Pipeline to Kaseya to JBS, enterprises large and small have fallen prey to breaches in security, often to devastating results.\n\nAccording to a SpyCloud report, 543 million breached assets [10], including 25.9 million credentials tied to Fortune 1000 employees, were available to cyber criminals online in 2020.\n\nCompanies have long invested in digital technologies to optimize their businesses, and that\'s a trend that shows no signs of slowing down - for good reason.\n\nDigital transformation fueled time-to-market acceleration and allowed organizations to compete in an increasingly crowded marketplace of firms. At the same time, strengthening your tech stack doesn\'t necessarily mean an equal investment in security - leaving critical vulnerabilities exposed in the process.\n\nOf those investments, cloud migration has certainly led the charge. The race to the cloud began as a stroll, but the pace accelerated to a full-on sprint with the necessity of hybrid work during the pandemic. In fact, Gartner predicts global cloud spending [11] to surpass $480 billion in 2022 - a 21.7% increase.\n\nWorse yet, remote users are expanding the attack surface and increasing risk.\n\nWith 83% of workers [12] in favor of hybrid work, global connectivity is now mission-critical. But as organizations shift to the cloud, complexity increases with every vendor added. Worse yet, remote users are expanding the attack surface and increasing risk. Simply put, security teams are struggling to maintain pace with the rate of change.\n\nAll told, the state of cybersecurity appears to be bleak - especially when you look ahead to the future. According to IBM, there are plenty more threats in store [13] for enterprises in 2022:\n\nCloud-bound malware will proliferate considerably.\n\nRansomware gangs will increase DDoS attacks.\n\nState-sponsored financial attacks will rise.\n\nCybercriminals will deploy more sophisticated tactics.\n\nThere will be an outcry for zero-trust user and application security.\n\nIndeed, enterprises are facing a grim reality. Without a comprehensive suite of next-generation networking and security technologies, businesses are leaving their most critical assets exposed. That\'s why cutting-edge frameworks, like Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), are key to the future of enterprise cybersecurity.\n\n[1] https://blog.checkpoint.com/2022/01/10/check-point-research-cyber-attacks-increased-50-year-over-year/\n\n[2] https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/cybersecurity/article/21184175/prepare-for-more-cyberattacks-in-2022\n\n[3] https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-20-billion-usd-by-2021/\n\n[4] https://www.agcs.allianz.com/news-and-insights/reports/allianz-risk-barometer.html#top10\n\n[5] https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach\n\n[6] https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/cybersecurity-trends-looking-over-the-horizon\n\n[7] https://www.sonicwall.com/2022-cyber-threat-report/\n\n[8] https://umbrella.cisco.com/info/2021-cyber-security-threat-trends-phishing-crypto-top-the-list\n\n[9] https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/report-ddos-attacks-increasing-year-on-year-as-cybercriminals-demand-extortionate-payouts#:~:text=Distributed%20denial%2Dof%2Dservice%20(,study%20on%20cyber%2Dattack%20trends\n\n[10] https://spycloud.com/2021-report-breach-exposure-of-the-fortune-1000/\n\n[11] https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-08-02-gartner-says-four-trends-are-shaping-the-future-of-public-cloud\n\n[12] https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/consulting/future-work\n\n[13] https://securityintelligence.com/articles/cybersecurity-trends-ibm-predictions-2022/\n\nGTT connects people across organizations, around the world, and to every application in the cloud.

However, these devices are increasingly becoming a vector of attack for individuals and businesses, according to a new report by SAM Seamless Network. The company reported more than one billion attacks occurred in 2021; more than 900 million of those were IoT-related.\n\nIn fact, out of those studied, 50% of home and micro business networks experienced an attack or suspicious network traffic behavior in 2021, including DDoS, brute force attacks, phishing, and DPI policy-based attacks. Additionally, the researchers found rising activity from both the Mirai and Mozi malware families. Perhaps the most surprising result was which devices were most vulnerable to attack. According to the report, routers accounted for 46% of all attacks analyzed. Other common vulnerable devices included extenders & mesh (17%), access points (17%), NAS (5%), VoIP (4%), cameras (3%) and smart home devices (3%).\n\nThe large volume of IoT-based attacks can be attributed to a number of factors. For one, there is a general lack of security in the IoT ecosystem, particularly for consumers or micro-businesses who may not be aware of the risk those devices pose. Additionally, there is great diversity in OEMs and operating systems in the IoT ecosystem, which can often lead to a fragmented approach to security updates (if they are done at all).\n\nThe rising activity of Mirai and Mozi is also a significant trend to watch. We have seen variants of the notorious Mirai botnet routinely targeting IoT devices since 2016 and we continue to see it targeting IoT devices and home routers. In 2021, we also saw the Mirai and Mozi botnets continue to add significant new capabilities and broaden their scope of attack to target additional devices.\n\nThe report is based on data collected from 132 million active IoT devices and 730,000 secure networks, which were anonymized for the purpose of the report.\n\nRead the full report by SAM Seamless Network.', 'image': 'https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1175885065-e1650646363465.jpg?w=1200&strip=all', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:38'}

Three Bitmain Antminer S9 mining rigs will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in the climate-controlled information technology wing of Fort Worth City Hall. The city says the miners will be hosted on a private network to minimize the security risk. Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work mining model, meaning that miners around the world run high-powered computers to simultaneously create new bitcoin and to validate transactions. The process requires professional-grade equipment, some technical know-how, and a lot of electricity. That\'s why Fort Worth\'s pilot project is starting small, according to the mayor.\n\nFort Worth mayor breaks down city\'s bitcoin mining pilot project Lee Bratcher\n\nEach of the program\'s three machines will consume the same amount of energy as a household vacuum cleaner, according to city estimates. While the mayor doesn\'t expect the three miners to be major money makers, the cost of electricity needed for the program is expected to be offset by the value of bitcoin mined. Beyond adding bitcoin to the city\'s balance sheet, Parker — who took office last year and is the city\'s first-ever millennial mayor — believes that leaning into bitcoin will go a long way toward putting Fort Worth on the map. "For Fort Worth, a lot of people don\'t know who we are," Parker told CNBC. "We want to change that conversation, and we believe that tech innovation including cryptocurrency is the way we\'re going to do that."\n\nRebranding Fort Worth\n\nBuilding a three-rig mine, even in a crypto-friendly jurisdiction like Texas, requires clearing bureaucratic red tape. "This is something brand new for any city," said Parker. "There\'s a lot of policy here that we\'ve had to jump through hoops to understand." To make it happen, the city has teamed up with a few key partners, including the Texas Blockchain Council, which donated the three mining rigs (each valued at roughly $600 apiece), and Luxor Technologies, a mining pool, which lets a single miner combine its hashing power with thousands of other miners all over the world to increase their chances of earning bitcoin. Parker, who has been in the job almost a year, got the idea to break into bitcoin after talking with a few friends in the venture capital world, who told her that 80% of venture capital is essentially spent on tech, and cryptocurrency is at the center of that right now.

This pilot program, launched by the Office of Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker and the City of Fort Worth in partnership with Texas Blockchain Council, recognizes the exponential growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries while advancing Fort Worth’s goal of becoming a leading center of tech and innovation.\n\nBeginning today, the S9 Bitcoin mining machines will run 24/7 in the climate-controlled Information Technology Solutions Department Data Center located at Fort Worth City Hall, where they will be housed on a private network to minimize security risk. The program is made possible through the donation of three machines from Texas Blockchain Council, a nonprofit association made up of companies and individuals that work in Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining, crypto and blockchain industries. The donation was formally accepted by the Fort Worth City Council today.\n\n“With blockchain technology and cryptocurrency revolutionizing the financial landscape, we want to transform Fort Worth into a tech-friendly city,” Parker said. “Today, with the support and partnership of Texas Blockchain Council, we’re stepping into that world on a small scale while sending a big message – Fort Worth is where the future begins,” the mayor added. “These small but powerful machines mark Fort Worth’s larger commitment to becoming a leading hub for technology and innovation.”\n\n“The Texas Blockchain Council is thrilled to be part of this first-of-its-kind pilot program as the City of Fort Worth begins mining Bitcoin. By starting small to learn as they go, Fort Worth is positioning itself to be the bitcoin mining capital of Texas. The state as a whole has already established itself as the bitcoin mining capital of the world,” said President and Founder of Texas Blockchain Council Lee Bratcher. “We are grateful for the support of several of our member companies, specifically, Luxor Technologies and Rhodium Enterprises, as they provided strategic guidance for this project.”\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation. “Mining” is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem. The first computer to find the solution to the problem receives the next block of bitcoins and the process begins again.\n\nBy limiting the pilot program’s focus to three machines, the city achieves the goals of responsibly assessing and executing a municipal Bitcoin mining program at a manageable scale. After six months, the city will evaluate the program.\n\nBased on the number and type of machines being used, the city estimates each will consume the same amount of energy as a household vacuum cleaner. The nominal amount of energy needed for the program is expected to be offset by the value of Bitcoin mined. Keeping the pilot program small enables the city to learn the potential impact and opportunities for Bitcoin.\n\n“Texas is increasingly being recognized as the global leader in Bitcoin and blockchain, and Fort Worth will have a seat at that table,” said Fort Worth Director of Economic Development Robert Sturns. “The pioneering spirit is alive and well in Fort Worth, and with this program we will attract dynamic companies that share in this vision for the future.”\n\nThe program is part of Fort Worth’s larger plan for growth, building momentum onto recent efforts, including partnerships with Texas A&M University System’s planned Research and Innovation Center in downtown Fort Worth and Techstars Physical Health Fort Worth Accelerator, and establishing the city’s first Entrepreneurship and Innovation Council Committee to build a next-level entrepreneurship ecosystem.\n\nIn the Economic Development Strategic Plan of the City of Fort Worth adopted by City Council, the city has set a goal of “a ‘next-level’ economic development strategy must encourage innovation and creativity, build an environment that is attractive to talented individuals and dynamic businesses, and maintain a forward-looking organizational structure.”\n\nPhoto: Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker stands amid the Bitcoin mining machines in the City of Fort Worth Information Technology Solutions Department Data Center, marking the city’s commitment to becoming a hub for technology and innovation.\n\nGet articles like this in your inbox.

Money, reputation, fraud and the functioning of your business could all be lost in a cyberattack.\n\nEstimates suggest that in 2025, cybercrime will cost the global economy some $10.5 trillion – more than the entire value of the illegal drugs trade combined.\n\nUnfortunately, the same trends that make data science possible, coupled with the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and a poorly concerted global response to cybercrime means that cybersecurity is unlikely to drop down the Boardroom agenda any time soon.\n\nWhilst we still maintain a strong focus on traditional measures of security in business (who would leave their office permanently unlocked?), we’re playing catchup in confronting the challenges posed by cybersecurity.\n\nIndeed, in the United Kingdom, for several years now, you’re more likely to be the victim of a cybercrime than physical violence or robbery.\n\nUnderstanding the threats\n\nFeeling a little bit terrified? You should be. There are a lot of bad actors out there aiming to cause harm.\n\nIt’s almost implausible that you won’t be an intended victim of a cyber attack, either personally or corporately, in the next working year: just check your spam folder in your emails for evidence.\n\nBelow are the most common types of defence you should be employing to protect you.\n\nDatabase, network and infrastructure security: your network and infrastructure will cover routers, firewalls, servers, storage systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and domain name systems (DNS). Each of these are vulnerable to attack. The US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) lists a number of wise defences, including: physically and virtually separating elements of the network to best protect sensitive information; operating a principle of “least privilege” so that users are only given access to the minimum, as opposed to the maximum, information they need; implementing good wireless security, such as strengthened passwords; and using firewalls (which can automatically filter out dangerous traffic). If you have physical servers on premises these must be securely guarded and protected. Ensure all database software management is up to date with any upgrades to protect from any known vulnerabilities.\n\nData security: first and foremost, you need to understand what data you have, where it lies and who has access to it. Your data security approach should involve using techniques to avoid unauthorised access, using encryption to scramble data, and carefully protecting encryption keys to allow access to data. Use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can also help secure and encrypt data access once data is being used by users.\n\nIdentity management: users present a very high-risk point of failure for an organisation. Just like you need to understand where your data sits, you need to understand who has access to your organisation’s software and hardware. Once you have this information you must very clearly keep a log of access controls and ensure that only authorised users can access your systems and network. Again, the principle of “least privilege” should guide your access permissions.\n\nEndpoint user and device security: many users in your organisation – particularly with the rise of remote working exacerbated by Covid-19 – will use a variety of devices (mobiles, laptops, personal computers etc) to access your organisation’s network. Ensure that these devices are only in the right hands and that each device is secured with strong passwords and two-factor authentication (such as entering a password and code received to a separate device).\n\nApplication security: ensuring applications are up-to-date with patches and upgrades so that most recently discovered vulnerabilities are covered and afforded protection.\n\nDisaster recovery and business continuity planning: in the event of a catastrophe or disaster, ensure you have a clear plan to recover information and ensure your business operations can continue as far as possible. This may include separate backups of data, alternative devices, separate network connections and putting in place contingency workflows that can operate under different cybersecurity attack scenarios.\n\nStandards and certification: international standards are available to guide best-practice cybersecurity. These vary from industry and geography, although the family of standards known as ISO/IEC 27000 are a good starting point. To gain certification, your organisation must put in place and clearly demonstrate compliance against the standards, which is then externally verified by a certifier.\n\nGetting the basics in place\n\nSo, what are some core basics you need to do? First, make sure your organisational leadership is committed to cybersecurity. Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) or similar are becoming increasingly common in companies with the sole responsibility of cybersecurity across an enterprise. However, you don’t need a CISO to show leadership. Ensure someone on your Board – and ideally an executive and non-executive board member – is responsible for overall cybersecurity. In some territories, such as Europe and the UK, GDPR regulations require this by law.\n\nSecond, solidify your networking security by running a series of vulnerability tests. This is where a paid actor, acting on your behalf, tries a series of ways of attacking your network and identifies vulnerabilities which you can then mitigate. Third, ensure applications are up-to-date with the latest upgrades for cybersecurity. Web applications, as discussed, are particularly vulnerable, and make sure you understand where the points of risk lie with them. Fourth, implement staff training. This should involve everything from secure password management to understanding what to do in a disaster recovery scenario.\n\nAnd finally, implement strong password management. Anecdotally – accurate data is hard to come by as many organisations are reluctant to share how often they have been attacked – poor password management is one of the most common methods of attack for cyber criminals. Ensure all staff use secure passwords alongside multi-factor authentication.\n\n\n\nDr Antonio Weiss is the author of The Practical Guide to Digital Transformation and a senior partner at The PSC, a public services digital transformation consultancy.

Social media is described as a digital platform that allows users to create an account, share content and interact with other users. Main examples include sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, but there are hundreds of different social media sites, each offering a unique set of features and catering to different groups of people.\n\nSocial media is perfect for connecting with friends and family, as well as sharing ideas and content with people from all over the world. It’s also a great place for businesses to interact with their potential consumers, engaging with them and advertising to them. One of the reasons why social media sites have become so successful is that they sell personal data to companies for advertising purposes. Brands can target people based on their age, location, and likes, reaching their target demographics more easily.\n\nAlthough social media is very popular, with over half of the world’s population now owning at least one account, it does raise issues about cybersecurity. When signing up to a social media site, users need to be careful that they’re not compromising their data, falling victim to data leaks, or downloading malware.\n\nWith over 4 billion users, social media platforms present a big target for hackers, scammers, and identity thieves. As a result, it pays to be careful about the platform you use and how you use it. In this article, our US cybersecurity expert Alex Lysak will be looking at nine different ways social media and cybersecurity are connected and how to practice social media safety.\n\nWhat is Cybersecurity?\n\nCybersecurity is the practice of protecting devices or networks from cyber-attacks, malware or other online threats. These cyberattacks are typically aimed at gaining access to, altering, or destroying sensitive data, extorting money from users, or disrupting normal corporate activities. Whether you’re an individual or a company, cybercriminals don’t discriminate, and you need to be able to protect your devices and data from cyber security threats.\n\nBecause there are more devices than humans nowadays, and attackers are growing more inventive, putting in place effective cybersecurity measures is very difficult. Over the last few years, there has been a rise in the number of high-profile cyber-attacks, particularly those using ransomware. This type of malware encrypts a user’s data, making it useless unless the user gives in to demands and pays a ransom.\n\nHackers often demand payment in the form of cryptocurrency, which has the advantage of being much easier to use than other forms of online payment. Payments made using cryptocurrencies have increased a lot over the past few years, as researched by Scanteam, this is partly thanks to the added level of security as well as the potential anonymity.\n\nProtecting Yourself While Using social media\n\nAlthough you can use antivirus software and other tools to keep your device secure from threats, the best way to stay safe online is by taking the right precautions. By following good practices while online, you can avoid malware and stay safe from cyber-attacks, including those on social media.\n\nHere are a few of the things to avoid or be careful of when using social media if you want to stay secure:\n\nProviding Too Much Personal Information\n\nWhen using social media, users often fill out their profiles without caring much about who sees them. Although it may seem innocuous to provide details on your birthday, your family members, where you grew up, and more, it can put you at risk. By publishing so much information about yourself online, you can be affecting your cybersecurity, making it easier for hackers to gain entry to your accounts or for identity thieves to open up credit cards or bank accounts in your name.\n\nAdditionally, you should also be careful about the contact details you provide, as scammers will often look for email addresses and phone numbers. When combined with your personal information, they can use this to create highly believable scams aimed at extracting money from your accounts. Privacy is one of the most important social media security issues, and users should be more careful about their personal information.\n\nPhishing Scams\n\nA phishing scam is one of the most common types of online scams, where scammers use social engineering to get the information they want. This type of social engineering involves an attacker sending a phony message to a human target in the hopes of obtaining sensitive information. In addition, the scam could also involve or deploy harmful software on the victim’s infrastructure, such as ransomware.\n\nWhen using social media, you should always be wary of messages you receive, especially from people you don’t know. Sometimes it could even appear to be someone you know sending a phishing message, either through a hacked account or a fake profile.\n\nInsecure Passwords\n\nPasswords are essential for keeping your accounts secure, and you should always make sure to use strong passwords no matter what kind of account it is. Using weak passwords is asking for trouble, as it means hackers can easily break into your account. Not only that, but you should also avoid reusing passwords on multiple accounts. You shouldn’t use the same password for your online banking and your Facebook account, for example.\n\nSingle Layer Security\n\nPasswords aren’t the only thing you should use to secure your account; many online sites also offer two-factor authentication or digital ID. This is where the site will send a code to your phone for you to use as well as your password. You should definitely set this up, as it means that even if hackers manage to crack your password, they won’t be able to get access to your account.\n\nOutdated Apps\n\nSocial media apps are constantly updated to remove bugs and exploits that make them vulnerable to social networking security threats. If you want your device to stay safe, make sure the app you’re using is up to date, and if you’re not sure, you can check to see if updates are available. Additionally, you can set the app to update automatically when new software patches are released.\n\nUnsecure Mobile Networks\n\nWhen using social media on a mobile device, you should be careful about which networks you connect to. Using mobile data in the US is fine but connecting to open Wi-Fi networks is often a risk. When you connect to an unsecured mobile network, you could be opening your device up to malware and cyber-attacks.\n\nMalware Links\n\nMalware links are rare on social media as they often get reported and taken down. However, you can still find plenty of examples of social media cyber-attacks through malware being spread over various platforms, particularly through private messages. If you don’t know the person, never open the link and be very careful about what links you open in general.\n\nTags and Locations\n\nPart of the fun of social media is tagging friends in photos and sharing your location. However, this can potentially put you at risk. Be careful about sharing your location online, especially as you never know who can see this information. Some people in the US have had their homes robbed after revealing their location on social media, and it can be a cybersecurity risk too.\n\nPoor Privacy Controls\n\nWhen using social media, you’re in control over who gets to see the content that you share, but you do need to adjust the privacy settings to change this. Make sure you revisit this often to prevent people not connected to you from accessing your personal data and ensure proper data security.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAlex Lysak is working in online marketing since 2011, his main areas of expertise are marketing research, social media marketing, and SEO.

It will also feature a range of workshops, training courses, and much more. For more information, and to register, go here.\n\n\n\nRansomware will continue to get all the headlines, while in the background business e-mail compromise attacks will lead to large single-loss events that are both easier and faster to conduct for threat actors.\n\nSo says Taariq Gaffoor, territory manager Southern Africa at Secureworks. “There will also be an increase in cloud-based attacks due to the false assumption that security is built into core cloud platforms such as Azure, AWS, and others, or within SaaS applications.”\n\nSecureworks will be presenting at the ITWeb Security Summit 2022, to be held at the Sandton Convention Centre from 31 May to 2 June, and at Century City in Cape Town on 6 June.\n\n\n\nGafoor says while cloud-based technologies, such as containers, make deployment easier, they also introduce additional risk. With cloud and SaaS there is often confusion in terms of who is responsible for data protection, and threat actors know this.\n\n“This is why we should expect more attacks due to misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and a lack of adequate controls on these platforms,” he explains.\n\nHe believes hostile nation state activity will continue to focus primarily on espionage rather than disruption and destruction. “Nation state threat actors will continue to conduct operations aimed at harvesting bulk data to support subsequent cyber operations and traditional espionage activities, as we have recently seen play out in Ukraine.”\n\nAddressing the challenges\n\nSpeaking of what can be done to address the most pressing cyber security challenges, Gaffoor says there are several vital steps that can be taken to help tackle these.\n\n"Firstly, companies need to prepare. To be prepared they need to understand where their weaknesses and vulnerabilities lie. Once they understand this, they can begin deploying the appropriate preventative measures to block threats from getting into their organisation, and ensure that they are proactively scanning for vulnerabilities.”\n\nThen, he says it is important to ensure that systems are set up to help the business detect threats. “Many threats are new or unknown, so early detection across the IT landscape to pinpoint anomalies is critical.”\n\nFinally, Gaffoor says response is key. “If you detect a threat, is your business equipped to detect, respond and resolve it before damage can be done? Bear in mind that the average time a threat lingers on the network is 212 days, so early detection and automated response is critical.”\n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhen asked where he sees cyber security in five year\'s time, Gaffoor says predicting the future in cyber is always a tricky business, because the landscape moves at a pace of its own, simultaneously both quickly and slowly.\n\n“This year it will be five years since WannaCry and in many ways it feels like little has changed. And if we cast our gaze forward, in five years\' time I would imagine that threat actors willstill be seeking to gain political and economic advantage through espionage, crime groups will still be looking at the most efficient ways to make money and new vulnerabilities will continue to emerge.”\n\nHe says companies have little control over many of these aspects – what is within their gift is how they approach and invest in cyber security. “The one thing we always say to customer is that they must get the fundamentals right, such as patching and multi-factor authentication, to boost their cyber resilience.”\n\nCovering the basics\n\nGaffoor says organisations that don’t have the basics covered are continuing to leave the back door wide open. “Over the last year there have been a number of high-profile attacks, but we’re still seeing too few companies taking the action needed to not only close the back door but lock it. More needs to be done. Cyber resilience takes time, investment and resources. It is not an end destination or a box you can tick, but an ongoing journey.”\n\nOne element that has the potential to shape industry dynamics over the coming years is the recognition that sharing and partnerships between public and private is beneficial to all, he ends.\n\n“For example, the recent JCDC initiative to bring the US government collaboration out into the open. The more we can create an environment where the industry\'s learning from one another, the stronger our community becomes.”', 'image': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cuKKY5KASWv6_miQdbJwK0OllTjb_nYlxios3LVCvi9cPZ5pDNKlZv577cAuHwfgoG_qiyqhcFDBNxmlyIp0XAiZRbctVBZwfsdt=w816-h428', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:02'}

It is sending out millions of phishing emails in mass spam campaigns, with the aim of infecting devices with malware that ropes them into a botnet controlled by cyber criminals.\n\nSEE: A winning strategy for cybersecurity (ZDNet special report)\n\nAccording to cybersecurity researchers at Proofpoint, Emotet appears to be testing new attack techniques at a small scale, which could potentially be adopted for much larger campaigns. These techniques are designed to make attacks more difficult to detect, ultimately increasing the chances of them being successful.\n\nThe emergence of new attack techniques has coincided with a period when it seemed widespread Emotet campaigns were put on hold, with new activity occurring at low volume.\n\nOne of these new campaigns exploits compromised email accounts to send out spam-phishing emails with one-word subject lines – researchers note that one of them is simply \'Salary\', a subject line that could encourage a user to click out of curiosity.\n\nThe message bodies contain only a OneDrive URL, which hosts zip files containing Microsoft Excel Add-in (XLL) files with a similar name to the email subject line.\n\nIf the XLL files are opened and executed, Emotet is dropped on the machine, infecting it with malware. Emotet can be used to steal information from victims and serves as a backdoor for deploying other malware onto the compromised Windows system – it has commonly been used as a backdoor to deploy ransomware attacks.\n\nWhat makes this campaign distinct from previous Emotet campaigns is the use of OneDrive URLs – typically, Emotet attempts to spread itself via the use of Microsoft Office attachments or phishing URLs that link to Office files.\n\nThe use of XLL files is also unusual, as Emotet has traditionally been distributed using Microsoft Excel or Word documents containing Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) scripts or macros.\n\nSEE: Clueless hackers spent months inside a network and nobody noticed. But then a ransomware gang turned up\n\nThis switch comes after Microsoft announced it would begin blocking macros obtained from the internet by default from April. That move is part of an effort to help protect users from a technique commonly used in phishing attacks, so gangs are likely testing new techniques to get around this.\n\n"After months of consistent activity, Emotet is switching things up. It is likely the threat actor is testing new behaviors on a small scale before delivering them to victims more broadly, or to distribute via new TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) alongside its existing high-volume campaigns," said Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint.\n\n"Organisations should be aware of the new techniques and ensure they are implementing defenses accordingly," she added.\n\nZDNet has contacted Microsoft for comment.\n\nMORE ON CYBERSECURITY', 'image': 'https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/36eacd57be8cf45d5617f398302d88af4e47917b/2021/12/06/65e99cdf-bb9a-43e6-b9f2-7bbcfab2c195/hacker-hands-typing-on-a-keyboard.jpg?width=770&height=578&fit=crop&auto=webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:30'}

The number of targeted attacks was up by an even higher percentage – 81 per cent compared to the previous quarter.\n\nDDoS attacks, as Reg readers know, are designed to disrupt network resources of businesses and public services. They are particularly nasty when compromised systems are depended upon by the wider population.\n\nSeveral Israeli government sites were knocked offline in March as servers buckled under a massive attack and miscreants have continued to make use of vulnerable systems to launch assaults on services.\n\n"Q1 2022," said Kaspersky, "saw a sudden increase in attacks in late February as a result of the crisis in Ukraine."\n\nIndeed it did. The report showed a spate of DDoS attacks on Russian websites (including those of the media and the government) kicking off from February 24. Responsibility for several attacks was claimed by individuals affiliated with hacktivist group Anonymous. Ukraine institutions and commercial services have also come under attack, with the website of the Mayor of Kyiv attacked and the sites of a number of Ukraine ministries defaced.\n\nRussia\'s response to attacks on its services, according to Kaspersky, has been to fling up geofencing to restrict access from abroad and publish lists of IP addresses from where attacks allegedly originated.\n\nAs well as attacks arising from Russia\'s aggression in Ukraine, Kaspersky noted North Korean websites dropping offline following missile tests as well as attacks carried out on blockchain and NFT vendors.\n\nMiscreants are also getting ever more creative. Kaspersky noted some demanding bitcoin from victims in exchange for protection against their attacks.\n\nHowever, the major cause of growth is (according to Kaspersky) "the crisis in Ukraine". Without it, figures would actually have fallen relative to the previous quarter. Instead, there was a marked spike, although things calmed down a bit as March wore on.\n\nKaspersky itself has had a bit of a hard time of late. In March it was put on the US Federal Communication Commission\'s naughty step (apparently unconnected to Russia\'s activities in Ukraine) and Germany\'s cybersecurity agency took exception to the company\'s wares in the same month.\n\nStill, the report makes for interesting reading. While Kaspersky noted the spike in DDoS attacks coincided with the conflict in Ukraine, it also noted the US still led the way in terms of attacks targeted against it, with 44.34 percent of attacks, up from 43.55 percent in Q1 2021.\n\nUltimately the advice remains the same – cyberdefenses need to be deployed in advance because once one is under attack, it\'ll be too late. ®', 'image': 'https://regmedia.co.uk/2020/11/02/shutterstock_stock_exchange_security.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:12'}

This utility extracts Exchangeable Image File annotations, metadata, and tags.\n\nMoreover, it can trigger another vulnerability to obtain remote code execution. This vulnerability is triggered by DjVu files and was identified by researcher William Bowling in 2021 in ExifTool 12.23. It was surprising that none of the VirusTotal anti-virus scanners could detect the CySource researchers’ Base64 encoded payload they included in the malicious DjVu file’s metadata.\n\n“Instead of ExifTool detecting the metadata of the file, it executes our payload.” CySource\n\nThe researchers also got a reverse shell that allowed them to access over 50 internal network hosts with high privileges at Google and its other VirusTotal security vendor partners. Every time they uploaded a file with a new hash and a new payload, VirusTotal forwarded it to bots.\n\nThis indicates that apart from an RCE, the payload was forwarded by Google servers to the company’s internal network, partners, and customers as well.

Register today!\n\nGlobal healthcare company Novartis is using Snowflake technology as a platform to both improve business processes and launch life-changing medicines faster.\n\nLoïc Giraud, global head of digital platform and product delivery at Novartis, explained to VentureBeat how the company first adopted Snowflake in 2017. The company is using the technology as part of an organization-wide data and digital initiative called Formula One, which aims to digitize operations and bring data to the heart of its business processes.\n\nNovartis employs 2,000 data scientists, who use the company’s integrated data platform to support a range of activities from research into new drugs to creating insight that helps improve operational performance.\n\nThe company continues to explore how the technology can be used to exploit fresh opportunities and recently joined Snowflake’s newly launched Healthcare Data Cloud, which aims to create an integrated and cross-cloud data platform.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Giraud explained to VentureBeat how Novartis is placing Snowflake at the center of its integrated data stack and how it is using this platform to drive insight-generation processes.\n\nVentureBeat: What was the business challenge you wanted to solve when you adopted Snowflake in 2017?\n\nLoïc Giraud: “In the past, technologies had to do everything from start to end – ingestion, curation, integration. But I think the more we move on, you can see how certain data technologies have a specific role in your organization. Business entities want to get access to their own data and do their own work. So, we tried to establish a self-service, abstract layer through Snowflake that can go and fetch our data and then employees can use their own tools to analyze data or generate insight. Our use of Snowflake has been about helping our employees generate data and then embed that information into other business processes.”\n\nVentureBeat: Why did you select Snowflake rather than other tools on the market?\n\nGiraud: “Our Formula One platform is best-of-breed – and Snowflake is part of that architecture. When we started this journey to the cloud, and tried to build our data platform, we looked for a range of capabilities. For each of the capabilities, we looked at whether the native cloud provider could provide a capability that supports the feature set that we needed. We ran different evaluations across different solutions. And we decided to use Snowflake in our refinement layer, which is about creating aggregated data to serve certain purposes. But over time, that has changed – and, also, Snowflake as a product has evolved, so we started in one area, but it is now used in other areas.”\n\nVentureBeat: How is Snowflake integrated into your day-to-day processes?\n\nGiraud: “It’s across three key areas. So, we’re using it for analytics generation – we ingest data into a big data platform, such as AWS or Azure. Snowflake can work across multiclouds. The second thing we do is prepare the data for insight generation across different use cases, such as research and development, incentive compensation for field reps, sustainability targets and financial targets. The other thing we’re using is the Snowflake Data Marketplace to integrate information from other sources. So, in the process we used to have, we used to buy data sets from different vendors and then we would integrate that information via APIs on our platform. But with the Data Marketplace, some of the third-party information we need – such as market and industry data – is already available.”\n\nVentureBeat: How easy is it to create an integrated data stack?\n\nGiraud: “It takes time, I guess. We’ve been running our Formula One program for three years and it takes a lot of investment in terms of finance and human resources from my side and the business side, too. I think the main difficulty is that the technology changes relatively fast. So, how do you get to a level of maturity, where you can start to deliver outcomes, and on the other hand, how do you avoid creating technical debt? You’re going to have these two types of processes going on continuously. And if you wait for the tech stack to be fully ready before you start to deliver the outcomes, then the business has gone somewhere else. So, you need to continuously update your capabilities in the stack while you’re delivering value. And in our case, we divided the two – we have a platform team, and we have use-case driven teams. And then these teams meet somewhere in the middle, so the platform can deliver the roadmap, while the use case delivers the outcome.”\n\nVentureBeat: How will you be looking to develop your use of Snowflake in the coming months?\n\nGiraud: “Scale, scale, scale – we have a huge pipeline of use cases and products that we want to build. Not only are we multicloud, but we’re also multiregion. So, we have a region in Europe and the U.S., and we have implemented our data solution in China. Snowflake is not yet present in China, but we hope it will be soon. So, it’s all about scaling the product and then scaling across regions, so that we can make sure that we can support the needs of the business.”\n\nVentureBeat: What will joining Snowflake’s Healthcare Data Cloud mean for your company?\n\nGiraud: “We’re looking to work with other organizations in healthcare to develop industry standards. One of the things we’re thinking about is, ‘Can we create a solution, with other partners, that can be used by anyone?’ The other thing we’re considering is, ‘How do we connect our data ecosystem with prescribers, suppliers and other drug companies?’ There’s a lot of connections in the system to integrate and interconnect. You can deliver much more value for the patient if you’re able to connect the full supply chain. I believe there’s much more to win for everyone if you’re able to openly share your information.”\n\nVentureBeat: What else are you looking to achieve during the next 12 to 24 months?\n\nGiraud: “We’ve created our insight-generation platform and now I’m trying to build Formula One as the digital ecosystem of the company. So, I’ll be looking to integrate automation, blockchain and self-service development solutions to create a true digital ecosystem for the organization. We run 500 drug trials a year. It’s important we can answer key questions, such as, ‘Where do we invest our money, in which trials, and at what point of time should we decide to continue or stop that trial?’ These are activities that now are driven from business processes that are supported by the data platform that we’ve created.”', 'image': 'https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1216142687.jpg?w=1200&strip=all', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:15:56'}

This is because of the big and decisive moves the Bitgert team has been making. In fact, the Bitgert coin has been among the widely searched projects across the world, which is evident from the high ranking on the google search trends against big cryptocurrencies like Binance.\n\nThe fast-growing Bitgert ecosystem has been one of the major attractions of this project. The Bitgert team has accomplished so much in building this ecosystem, considering the project is just 8-months-old. But it is the launch of the Bitgert BRC20 blockchain that has increased the rate at which the Bitgert ecosystem is developing.\n\nNote that the Bitgert blockchain is the first gasless blockchain and is the fastest chain in the crypto industry. This means the Bitgert chain is faster and cheaper to transact on compared to Binance and other large cryptocurrencies. The Bitgert chain adoption is already growing faster than any other chain because of its zero gas fee mechanism.\n\nThe quality of products and the huge number are the reasons the crypto community believes that the Bitgert ecosystem might become the next Binance. The Bitgert team is building NFTs, web3, DeFi, and many other decentralized products for the chain. Already, the Bitgert centralized exchange is almost complete and will be launching soon.\n\nAnother DeFi product coming is the Bitgert Paybrise, which will enable merchants to accept BRISE as payment. The Bitgert team is about to start developing its Web3 products, including its web3 oracle, web3 Geo DataMap, and many other products.\n\nOn the NFT products, the Bitgert NFTs marketplace is in the construction stage and is expected to be one of the best performers because of the powerful blockchain. But it is the plethora of the Bitgert projects joining the Bitgert ecosystem that might grow this ecosystem exponentially.\n\nThe Bitgert Startup Studio is the program bringing 1000+ projects to this ecosystem in the next 365 days. The Bitgert team has already launched 15+ projects, and more are coming up, with over 100 projects expected to join the Bitgert ecosystem every month.\n\nThe launched Bitgert backed projects are doing so well and have grown multi-million marketcaps. Omniaverse is one of the best performing Bitgert Startup Studio. However, all other projects launched on the Bitgert chain are doing pretty well.\n\nWith such a huge number of products and projects joining the Bitgert ecosystem and the pace at which they are joining, Bitgert will grow exponentially and might be the next Binance a few months down the line.

The Bitgert might have a huge marketcap just like Ethereum.\n\nThe Bitgert team has done so much for the short period the project has been in the market, but a lot more is coming. Here are some proven facts about the Bitgert and why it might be the next Ethereum:\n\nBitgert\n\nAccording to the crypto investors, Bitgert has everything to be the next Ethereum. The Bitgert team is building one of the most powerful ecosystems with a range of disruptive products, hence the potential to explode thousand times.\n\nAmong the products, the Bitgert team has built so far is the Bitgert BRC20 blockchain. The Bitgert chain has the fastest speed today, and its gas fee is the lowest. In fact, the Bitgert gas fee is zero. BRC20 blockchain is also offering smart contracts functionality.\n\nThe Bitgert team is in the process of developing more disruptive products, with the NFTs, DeFi, and Web3 being some of the products coming up in the roadmap V2. But the crypto community is also talking about the 1000+ projects the Bitgert team is adding to this ecosystem.\n\nWith all these developments and the powerful ecosystem, Bitgert has everything to be the next Ethereum. With more products and thousands of dApps, Bitgert is definitely the next big thing.\n\nCentcex\n\nThough not as disruptive as the Bitgert project, Centcex is another cryptocurrency that investors need to look at. Among the key factors making Centcex stand out is the high utility project that the Centcex team is building. The Centcex whitepaper says that this is a project that is going to build an unlimited number of products for its ecosystem.\n\nThe Centcex roadmap already has some of the products’ development already started. The Centcex exchange is one of the projects that the team is building. There will be more products coming into this ecosystem, with the team focusing on products that are in high demand. This means Centcex will be one of the most adopted projects, hence a skyrocketing price.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe Ethereum team is working on developing one of the biggest crypto ecosystems, and it has so far done so well. Ethereum has one of the largest ecosystems in the crypto market today. But there have been a lot of challenges in growing the Ethereum ecosystem because of the slow and expensive blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is still one of the slowest chains and has the most expensive gas fee.\n\nThat’s why the likes of Bitgert have been outperforming Ethereum. Though the Ethereum upgrades are fixing this problem, the issue of the gas fee will remain one of the weakest areas for this chain. This is because it might not be easy for the Ethereum team to reach the zero gas fee that its competitor Bitgert is offering.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is solely the author’s opinion and not investment advice – it is provided for educational purposes only.

This established the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a team made up of cybersecurity professionals including Wendi Whitmore, senior vice president of Palo Alto Networks\' global threat intelligence team Unit 42.\n\nLandtroop says the CSRB has since focused its efforts on establishing zero trust framework, which was developed around ten years ago by current Palo Alto Network employee John Kindervag. Since then, it has been growing in popularity as government departments and businesses realise they face a new wave of cybersecurity threats as a result of remote working and the proliferation of devices.\n\n"Over the last two years, as much of the world was stuck at home, millions of workers came to rely on their internet connections. Zero trust allows organisations to identify and verify each person, device and application before they are given access, meaning no entity is implicitly trusted by default, and all must verify using multi-factor authentication, every time," Landtroop explains.\n\nKindervag worked at Forrester Research when he developed the zero trust framework and, not surprisingly, his old employer was bullish about the Biden administrations executive order and expected its decision to flow into the private sector: The United States federal government has validated, confirmed, and required zero trust. For the US government and its suppliers, this executive order represents massive change. But nongovernment organisations should expect to feel repercussions of this, as well.\n\n"According to Kindervag, zero trust systems that once took three years to set up can now be set up in three months. And its well worth the effort," says Landtroop.\n\n"While accurate figures are obviously hard to come by, some estimates suggest that businesses are losing up to $20bn a year through ransomware attacks."\n\nAccording to the 2022 Ransomware Threat Report produced by Palo Altos global threat intelligence team Unit 42, the average ransom demand in cases worked by the Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 security consultants rose 144% in 2021 to $2.2 million, while the average payment climbed 78% to $541,010.\n\n"That\'s just the ransom payment, which is often reduced by negotiators and doesn\'t include the cost of disruption to the business, or in some cases, the disruption to the public," Landtroop says.\n\n"In the US, the recent Colonial Pipeline hack stopped the flow of petrol and saw Americans hoarding supplies as stations in a number of states ran dry. There were emergency declarations, petrol prices spiked and the company paid a ransom of $5 million in Bitcoin to regain access to its systems (some the cryptocurrency was later recovered by authorities). The CEO admitted to the senate that the hackers were able to bring the country\'s biggest pipeline down by stealing a single password and that there was no multi-factor authentication, which is now seen as basic cybersecurity hygiene. Major beef producer JBS was also targeted."\n\nHow prepared are New Zealand businesses?\n\nCloser to home, companies like Lion, Toll Group and Fisher & Paykel Appliances have been targeted and the May 2021 Waikato DHB ransomware attack caused significant disruption to the regions health system. Surgeries were delayed, confidential patient information was sent to the media by the hackers and questions were asked about whether the other DHBs had taken the necessary steps to avoid a similar fate.\n\n"With plans to centralise the country\'s 20 DHBs into a single health service, we need to be confident that the IT systems undergirding such crucial public services are robust and that sensitive data remains safe - and a zero trust network is the best way to do that," Landtroop says.\n\n"Cyber security professionals know zero trust is the way to go, but many New Zealand businesses do not."\n\nA recent Palo Alto Networks survey found that only one-third of New Zealand businesses have implemented a zero trust policy, and more than 40% of respondents do not know what a zero trust policy means. The most common reasons for not adopting zero trust are a lack of knowledge and expertise to know how to make it happen (40%), a lack of resources to invest in cyber security (24%), and that Government is not providing enough information or resources to support businesses adopt a zero trust strategy.\n\n"To use a military analogy and trying to fight against cybercriminals is an ongoing battle the perimeters of our organisations have expanded dramatically as employees were scattered to the four winds," says Landtroop. "And, as a result, these perimeters are easier to breach."\n\nMany of those employees have started to return to the office, but the systems we need to continue operating what many experts believe will be the new norm - hybrid working from home and the office - are also the systems attackers are targeting. In NTT\'s 2020 Global Threat Intelligence Report, across the ditch in Australia, application-specific (40%) and web-application (20%) attacks dominated, accounting for nearly 60% of all attacks combined.\n\nAnd, like the Colonial Pipeline hack, it is compromised credentials that continue to be the favoured method of attack.\n\nOf all reported cyber incidents, 79% involved compromised credentials with phishing, brute-force attack, or unknown methods. In aggregate, this means that over half of ALL breaches, whether caused by a cyber incident, human error or system fault can be traced back to a credential-based issue.\n\n"Cybersecurity is not just about avoiding ransoms and embarrassment, however (New Zealand law now requires all companies to report data and privacy breaches). Its also an investment," says Landtroop.\n\n"Recent research by Forrester on the economic impact of Palo Alto Networks security products showed businesses had a 247% return on investment and $40.1 million in benefits over three years. That came via efficiency gains for IT, security, and end users; cost savings from sunsetting legacy technology; and the reduced risk of a data breach.\n\n"There is no such thing as complete cybersecurity, simply because humans are involved and humans are fallible. It is a team sport, where everyone individuals, businesses, and the authorities need to work together to safeguard the organisations data and integrity of assets. Thats why smart businesses (and smart government administrations) are increasingly looking to employ a zero trust framework to limit the risk," Landtroop adds.\n\n"In the real world, trust is crucial if you want to create healthy relationships in your personal and professional life. In the remote working world, we need to trust employees to do their jobs. But in the online world, trust is a vulnerability."', 'image': 'https://itbrief.co.nz/uploads/story/2022/04/27/compatible_GettyImages-1311242905__2_.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:33'}

It’s designed for content capture but is otherwise limiting for general usage, however.\n\nIt’s been more than a year and a half since we reviewed Samsung’s T7 portable SSD, and today we have the new Shield model in the lab. The T7 Shield takes the original formula and focuses on improving its physical endurance, addressing one of our complaints with the T7 that lacked the Ingress Protection (IP) rating that indicates it is shock, water and dust-resistant. This caveat also applied to the T7 Touch we reviewed way back in 2020.\n\nThe drive comes in three colors - black, cream, and blue - inside a shell that’s a bit thicker than its predecessors. This shell is made from an aluminum body covered with rubber, thicker due to the external ribbing that helps protect against drop damage. Additionally, Samsung has added two distinct barriers to protect the USB port, designed to keep out environmental elements like water and dust. Together, all of these factors enable the T7 Shield to meet IP65 certification requirements.\n\nWhat else is different about the Shield? Well, a lot is actually similar to the T7. Samsung still uses the DRAM-less Pablo SSD controller paired with an ASMedia ASM2362 bridge chip. AES 256-bit hard encryption is, thankfully, still supported. Many other specifications, such as the three-year warranty, remain the same. The T7 Shield also comes with the same number and type of USB cables. However, Samsung has opted for a newer type of flash, and the shift towards a durable design is substantial.\n\nSamsung also ensures compatibility with Windows 7 or higher, macOS, and Android Lollipop or higher. Compatibility for mobile devices includes the T7 Shield operating within the USB power specification, which means a maximum power draw of between 2.5W and 7.5W, depending on the port. Regardless, Samsung promises to maintain sufficient performance to meet high-resolution video recording requirements, defined as the ability to write at 900MBps consistently.\n\nSamsung also made a concerted effort to reduce waste on this product and earned a Product Carbon Footprint label from the Carbon Trust. This essentially means that all steps involved in creating the product and its packaging were designed and verified to minimize the resultant carbon footprint. For example, Samsung uses pulp material with one-third less tray packaging. It’s hard to complain about that.\n\nThis product is otherwise not too exciting, given that it doesn’t improve much on models going back over two years. It’s probably best to focus on what it does better - the T7 Shield has increased durability and guaranteed performance. This makes it an excellent choice for photographers and videographers in the field who want something consistent and reliable. We will see if this bears out in testing.\n\nSpecifications\n\nProduct 1TB 2TB Pricing $159.99 $289.99 Capacity (User / Raw) 1000GB /1024GB 2000GB / 2048GB Form Factor M.2 2280 M.2 2280 Interface / Protocol USB-C / USB Gen3 2x2 USB-C / USB Gen3 2x2 Included USB Type-C to Type-C, USB Type-C to Type-A cables USB Type-C to Type-C, USB Type-C to Type-A cables Controller Samsung Pablo Samsung Pablo DRAM No No Memory Samsung 128L TLC Samsung 128L TLC Sequential Read 1,050MBps 1,050MBps Sequential Write 1,000MBps 1,000MBps Random Read N/A N/A Random Write N/A N/A Security 256-bit AES (Hardware/SED) 256-bit AES (Hardware/SED) Power Bus-powered Bus-powered Endurance IP65, Shock/Vibration Resistant, Thermal Guard IP65, Shock/Vibration Resistant, Thermal Guard Endurance (TBW) N/A N/A Dimensions 88 x 59 x 13mm 88 x 59 x 13mm Weight N/A N/A Part Number MU-PE1T0R MU-PE2T0R Warranty 3-Year 3-Year\n\nThe Samsung T7 Shield comes in 1TB and 2TB capacities. It’s nice to see a 2TB option, and considering this drive is ideal for those who likely need capacity, the omission of smaller SKUs is not an issue. The drive is rated for up to 1,050/1,000MBps for sequential reads and writes, respectively. This is quite modest as a result of the 10Gbps bridge chip, especially considering we have 20Gbps and Thunderbolt 3 portable SSDs on the market. However, Samsung ensures 900MBps and 1000MBps sustained performance for the 1TB and 2TB SKUs, respectively, which is particularly excellent for the intended market. This is almost twice as fast as SATA-based portable options.\n\nThe T7 Shield has many features designed around security and durability, including hardware encryption. The drive is also IP65 rated and includes protection against dust, water, shock, and vibration. This includes being able to survive drops of up to two meters. Samsung additionally has a Dynamic Thermal Guard, which adjusts the drive's performance to make sure the casing remains below 57C, which is notably lower than the 60C international standard — this reduces the risk of users getting injured when grabbing the case.\n\nSoftware and Accessories\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe T7 Shield comes with both Type-C to Type-C and Type-C to Type-A USB cables, offering flexibility for use with multiple devices. It is also compatible with Samsung’s Portable SSD Software 1.0 and Samsung Magician. The former has editions for Windows, macOS, and Android, while the latter only operates on Windows.\n\nThe Portable SSD Software offers a streamlined UI to help users receive software and firmware updates for their device. You can also enable a security mode with a password or password and fingerprint. Samsung Magician, on the other hand, is more robust, offering the ability to monitor and benchmark the drive in addition to the features found in the Portable SSD Software.\n\nA Closer Look\n\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Image 2 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Image 3 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Image 4 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Image 5 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nOur T7 Shield sample is clad in a nice blue case, clearly thicker than the older T7 models. With its considerable contours, the rubber exterior helps reduce vibration and shock, including from drops. One face has the USB-C connector and indicator light, while the other has a label with a QR code and pertinent specifications, including the model and serial numbers.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe T7 Shield has thermal padding and an otherwise understated, green PCB. We can see the expected controller, bridge chip, and two NAND flash packages, with notably no DRAM on board.\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nSamsung’s Pablo controller, labeled S4LR033, is a DRAM-less four-channel design. This controller is also used in the other T7 models as well as Samsung’s 980 desktop NVMe drive. The bridge chip is ASMedia’s ASM2362, capable of 10Gbps transfer speeds, and Samsung uses it on the other T7 models and many other portable SSDs. The flash as labeled is Samsung K9DVGB8J1B-DCK0, which we have seen on other drives like the Samsung 870 EVO. It’s Samsung’s 128-layer TLC.\n\nThis 128-layer flash tends to come in 512Gb, or 64GB, dies, and each of the NAND packages here is 8Tb or 1TB in capacity. This suggests a 16DP (sixteen dies per package) configuration, similar to what’s in the 870 EVO, for a total of 32 dies at 2TB. Each die is capable of up to 82MBps in its native, non-SLC mode, which is more than sufficient to hit Samsung’s stated speeds. This does require the proper SLC cache design, particularly at 1TB, which is to say it should be more conservative to ensure a high level of performance.\n\nThis flash is also seen in some newer 970 EVO Plus drives — notably slower in TLC mode at 1TB than the original model that launched with less-dense, 92-layer TLC — but, if necessary for interleaving, it also appears in a 256Gb or 32GB per die configuration. Denser dies are particularly useful at higher capacities with four-channel controllers, such as we have here.\n\n\n\nLet's see how the drive does in our testing.\n\nMORE: Best SSDs\n\nMORE: How We Test HDDs And SSDs\n\nMORE: All SSD Content", 'image': 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CYjfLt7Gb8vfVzCVvdSzxR-1200-80.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:28'}

It lacks fingerprint scanning, but is otherwise a faster, more durable external SSD.\n\nIf you’ve had your eyes on Samsung’s fast USB 10Gbps T7 Touch, but weren’t sure it was suitable for your rough and tumble environment, your conundrum is at an end. The latest iteration in the T7 series–the T7 Shield–is IP65 rated to withstand a wet weather and offers additional protection against shock (though admittedly, shock is a bigger deal for portable hard drives than it is for portable SSDs). This is another top-tier USB drive from Samsung.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Samsung T7 Shield is a USB 10Gbps enclosure with an NVMe SSD inside. We’re a bit surprised the latest version didn’t opt for 20Gbps USB, though admittedly, such ports are pretty rare and will remain so until full USB4 implementations become the norm. The T7 Shield is available in 1TB and 2TB capacities for $160 and $290 respectively, and you can buy them with blue, beige, or black silicone-like protective coverings.\n\nThe drive measures 3.5-inches long by 2.3-inches wide by 0.5-inches thick, and weighs just under four ounces. That’s a little heavier than the T7 Touch, but wrapped in a silicone protective sleeve, it’s hardly surprising.\n\nThe extra weight is inconsequential in terms of transportability, and gives the T7 Shield a nice heft. Indeed, I contemplated hurling it against a wall to test shock resistance. I didn’t, though I dropped it from about four feet onto a wood floor with no ill effects.\n\nThe T7 Shield’s USB connector is Type-C and thoughtfully, Samsung includes both USB Type-A to Type-C and Type-C to Type-C cables.\n\nAs to the IP rating, 65 is a bit unusual. Most devices claim 67. If you want the entire IP lowdown, read this article by yours truly on our sister publication TechHive. But the gist of it is…\n\nThe first number, 6, means the T7 Shield can keep out just about any kind of particulate matter. The second number, 5, means you can spray it with water, but not immerse it. (7 would indicate that immersion is survivable). No doubt the Type-C port is the culprit for the lower liquid resistance rating, though we’ve seen them on plenty of Bluetooth speakers sporting the same port that claim IP67. Most cover the port with a captive plug, but not all.\n\nPerhaps, Samsung is just a little more conservative in their conclusions. I’m not saying drop the T7 Shield in the pool, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it survived a short dip—as long as it’s not connected and active. If it is, you’ve got other issues.\n\nSamsung’s Toolbox for its external drives. With the Touch you get fingerprint security. With the Shield you set the password and must have the software installed in any computer you wish to mount the drive on.\n\nThough the Shield lacks the Touch’s fingerprint reader, it can still be password secured using Samsung’s Portable SSD software. Of course, you must then install said software on any computer you want to access the drive from. That’s certainly not as handy as a simple finger scan, but workable.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Samsung T7 Shield showed a noticeable performance improvement over its T7 Touch predecessor, especially when it came to writing files. Then again, our Shield test unit was 2TB, where the Touch was 500GB. This will make a difference, especially during long writes as the drive can treat more NAND as single-bit/level, SLC secondary cache.\n\nWe recently switched to the latest CrystalDiskMark, version 8.04, and a new testbed so these charts are not direct comparable with those for previous drives. The two drives the Shield is compared to below were retested, however. That said, CDM 8 demonstrates that noticeable write speed improvement I just spoke of. (Right-click on images and choose “Open image in new tab” to see full-size versions.)\n\nQuicker writing was also largely responsible for the better overall performance in our 48GB transfers shown below. The older Touch actually proved a slightly faster reader.\n\nThe T7 Shield is a fast 10Gbps SSD and significantly faster than its predecessor writing.\n\nHaving 2TB instead of 500GB to play with was a boon for the T7 Shield when it came to writing our single large 450GB file. That said, the LaCie was also 2TB and not as quick. Samsung has obviously been upping its game (or components) since the last T7 iteration.\n\nHaving lots of NAND to use as cache helps during long sustained writes.\n\nThere aren’t many 10Gbps SSDs that will top the Samsung T7 in performance.\n\nExternal USB drive tests currently utilize Windows 11 64-bit running on an MSI MEG X570/AMD Ryzen 3700X combo with four 16GB Kingston 2666MHz DDR4 modules, a Zotac (Nvidia) GT 710 1GB x2 PCIe graphics card, and an Asmedia ASM3242 USB 3.2×2 card. Copy tests utilize an ImDisk RAM disk using 58GB of the 64GB of memory.\n\nConclusion\n\nThough we’d like to see a bit better water-proofing, the Samsung T7 Shield is indeed a much better drive for harsh environs than the Touch. Obviously, it lacks the convenience of fingerprint security that the Touch offers, but it’s a better performer and you can still secure it via software.

Many of the developers and money launderers for BlackCat/ALPHV are linked to Darkside/BlackMatter, indicating they have extensive networks and experience with ransomware operations," it continues.\n\nThe BlackCat gang uses previously compromised user credentials to gain initial access to the victim\'s system. The group then compromises Microsoft Active Directory user and administrator accounts and uses the Windows Task Scheduler to configure Group Policy Objects to deploy the ransomware.\n\nBlackCat also uses legitimate Windows tools – such as Microsoft Sysinternals, as well as PowerShell scripts – to disable security features in anti-malware tools, launch ransomware executables including on MySQL databases, and copy ransomware to other locations on a network.\n\nThe group practices double extortion by stealing data prior to encrypting it in order to threaten victims with a leak in the event they don\'t pay a ransom demand.\n\nCisco said it was unlikely the BlackCat gang or affiliates were using an Exchange flaw. However, Trend Micro researchers last week claimed to have identified BlackCat exploiting the Exchange bug CVE-2021-31207 during an investigation. That was one of the ProxyShell Exchange bugs discovered in mid-2021.\n\nBlackCat has versions that work on Windows and Linux, as well as VMware\'s ESXi environment, notes Trend Micro.\n\n"In this incident, we identified the exploitation of CVE-2021-31207. This vulnerability abuses the New-MailboxExportRequest PowerShell command to export the user mailbox to an arbitrary file location, which could be used to write a web shell on the Exchange Server," the firm said.\n\nSEE: Google: We\'re spotting more zero-day bugs than ever. But hackers still have it too easy\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is urging organizations to review the FBI\'s alert.\n\nThe FBI is seeking information from the public about BlackCat compromises. It wants "any information that can be shared, to include IP logs showing callbacks from foreign IP addresses, Bitcoin or Monero addresses and transaction IDs, communications with the threat actors, the decryptor file, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file."\n\nAs Windows Task Scheduler is commonly used by attackers to hide malicious activity within seemingly normal admin tasks, the FBI recommends organizations review Task Scheduler for unrecognized scheduled tasks, as well as to check domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or unrecognized user accounts.', 'image': 'https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/13ae50dad19fad76a55ec6b4fa192d06429898b4/2021/09/27/11cf4ae8-38a8-4caa-8a94-b2652ec8bc61/fbi-decision-to-withhold-kaseya-ransomware.jpg?width=770&height=578&fit=crop&auto=webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:06'}

Hence, the demand for cyber security increases with increase in these devices with rising cyber- attacks.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact Analysis:\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has affected various industries worldwide. Governments across the world implemented strict lockdown measures and social distancing norms in order to restrict the swift spread of the pandemic. Manufacturing facilities around the world were shut down during the initial stages of the pandemic. Moreover, the economic crisis after the pandemic might lead to a significant delay in the commercial roll-out of the IT industry.

"Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough." The decision to surround and contain continuing Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol has, the MoD thinks, both prevented redeployment of combat units from the south and reduced the effectiveness of those units.\n\nSaturday\'s situation report from the UK\'s MoD sees a protracted reset of Russian preparation to complete operations in Ukraine: "Defence Secretary Shoygu’s stated intent to introduce \'new methods of warfare\' is a tacit admission that Russian progress is not going as intended. While it may indicate an understanding that the war is not progressing as planned it will take some time to translate this into adapted tactics, techniques and procedures, and then implement for improved operational effect particularly in regards to land-based manoeuvre warfare." In the meantime the Russian army will rely on heavy and indiscriminate artillery fire. "Therefore, in the interim there is likely to be a continued reliance on bombardment as a means of trying to suppress Ukrainian opposition to Russian forces," the situation report concludes.\n\nReduction of cities by artillery is the one tactic the Russian army has shown itself able to execute; the Telegraph reports on the effects of fatigue and failure on the morale and efficiency of Russian maneuver units. Yesterday\'s MoD situation report drew attention to the friction low morale is imposing on Russian operations. "Ukraine has repelled numerous Russian assaults along the line of contact in the Donbas this week. Despite Russia making some territorial gains, Ukrainian resistance has been strong across all axes and inflicted significant cost on Russian forces. Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganise forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness."\n\nConcealing the scale of losses.\n\nThe British MoD also sees signs that the Russian government is working to minimize public awareness of the size of losses it\'s sustaining in the invasion of Ukraine. "Russia’s Ministry of Defence has proposed compensation payments for the families of deceased service personnel be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia’s losses from the domestic population."\n\nRussian conscription of Ukrainians?\n\nUkraine has expressed concern that occupying Russian forces will seek to redress personnel shortfalls by conscripting Ukrainians and forcing them to fight on behalf of Russia. The British MoD explained yesterday that Moscow has done this before: "The Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate and General Staff have accused Russia of planning to conscript Ukrainian civilians from the Russian occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. This would follow similar prior conscription practices in the Russian-occupied Donbas and Crimea." Such conscription violates the Geneva Convention, and would amount to another systematic Russian war crime: "Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states \'the Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces\', and \'no pressure or propaganda which aims at securing voluntary enlistment is permitted\'. \'Protected persons\' in this context includes civilians within occupied territories. Any enlistment of Ukrainian civilians into the Russian armed forces, even if presented by Russia as being voluntary or military service in accordance with Russian law, would constitute a violation of Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention."\n\nIt would be a violation of other laws of war as well. The International Committee of the Red Cross has a searchable guide to International Humanitarian Law where summaries of applicable law may be found:\n\n"Article 44 of the 1899 Hague Regulations provides: \'Any compulsion of the population of occupied territory to take part in military operations against its own country is prohibited.\'”\n\n"Article 23(h) of the 1907 Hague Regulations provides: \'A belligerent is likewise forbidden to compel the nationals of the hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed against their own country, even if they were in the belligerent’s service before the commencement of the war.\'”\n\n"Article 51, first paragraph, of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV provides: \'The Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces. No pressure or propaganda which aims at securing voluntary enlistment is permitted.\'”\n\n"Article 130 of the 1949 Geneva Convention III and Article 147 of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV provide that compelling a prisoner of war or a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile power is a grave breach of these instruments."\n\nThe protections have also been recognized in Russian domestic military regulations: "Under the Russian Federation’s Military Manual (1990), it is prohibited as a method of warfare \'to compel persons belonging to the enemy party to participate in hostilities against their country\'." The Russian Federation’s Regulations on the Application of IHL (2001) also state: “It is prohibited to compel the population in the occupied territory to serve in the armed or auxiliary forces of the occupying power.”\n\nStamp collecting.\n\nThe Snake Island garrison\'s defiant "Russian warship, go f**k yourself" became a rallying call in Ukraine, especially after the Moskva, the Russian warship to whom the message was directed, sank after being hit by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles. Ukrposhta, Ukraine\'s national postal service, issued stamps commemorating the incident, showing a Ukrainian soldier (presumably Roman Hrybov, who radioed the defiant reply to Moskva\'s demand that the garrison surrender) flipping the bird in the direction of a large but ineffectual looking Moskva. Within a few days of the stamp\'s issue, Ukrposhta said it had come under a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack apparently intended to disrupt domestic and international sales of the commemorative stamp. Ukrposhta offered no attribution, but in this case the circumstantial evidence pointing to Moscow is, as Gizmodo points out, too obvious to ignore. The postal service is working through the effects of the DDoS attack, and says that a lot of people are still getting through to buy the stamp. (Supplies are limited, collectors; act now.)\n\n#OpRussia: Anonymous counts coup.\n\nThe hacktivist collective has tweeted Its tally of recent successes claimed against Russian organizations: "#OpRussia: Since declaring \'cyber war\' on Kremlin\'s criminal regime, the #Anonymous collective has now published approximately 5.8 TB of Russian data via #DDoSecrets. #Anonymous vows to release more data belonging to Russian entities and government, including a commercial bank."\n\nOn Sunday Security Affairs published the results of its sifting through the documents Anonymous had leaked "over the last three days" and found that files were taken from four commercial businesses:\n\n"Enerpred is the largest producer of hydraulic tools in Russia and the CIS, specializing in the energy, petrochemical, coal, gas and construction industries. The collective has leaked a 432GB archive containing 645,000 emails."\n\n"Accent Capital is a commercial real-estate investment firm that owns or is directly involved with the management of many of the properties its clients invest in. The collective has leaked a 211GB archive containing 365,000 emails."\n\n"Sawatzky is a property management company. Sawatzky’s clients include Du Pont, Lenovo, Whirlpool, Aveva, Wella, Johnson + Johnson, Cisco, Google, Swatch, Avito, Samsung, Microsoft, Western Union, Saint-gobain, Turkish Airlines, and British American Tobacco. The collective has leaked a 432GB archive containing 575,000 emails."\n\n"Worldwide Invest is an investment firm with ties to Estonia and Russian railways. The collective has leaked a 130GB archive containing 250,000 emails."\n\nThat #OpRussia represents a successful hacktivist action seems beyond dispute, but its achievements also seem to confirm that hacktivism in this ongoing hybrid war has yet to rise above nuisance levels. The nuisance is real, but it remains exactly that: a nuisance.\n\n"Lacryphages," privateers, and state actors.\n\nAnonymous has been operating in the Ukrainian interest. There has been evidence of hacktivism in the Russian interest as well, although in that case it\'s difficult to distinguish from opportunistic cybercrime that exploits sympathy for Ukrainian suffering ("lachryphagy," "drinking of tears," in the colorful term used by an op-ed in TheHill), gangland privateering, and direct state action. CNN reports that humanitarian organizations working on Ukrainian relief have been the targets of phishing, or, as CNN puts it "malicious links and pornographic material on their cell phones." Most aid organizations are relatively poorly protected non-governmental organizations, and in many cases have difficulty even recognizing that they\'re under attack, still less able to respond to an attack quickly and effectively. CNN quotes Amazon Web Services as explaining that the attacks seem intended to “to spread confusion and cause disruption,” which seems particularly odious when the activities being disrupted are the distribution of food, clothing, and medical supplies.\n\nSpeculation about reasons for restraint in cyberspace.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald offers seven possible explanations for Russian offensive cyber operations to have remained at a nuisance level in Russia\'s hybrid war against Ukraine:\n\n"Ukrainians are ready for it." The Ukrainians have had help." "Russia may not want to destroy services it plans to exploit." "Russia may be holding back." "In a brutal war, cyber may not be needed." "Russian cyber troops may be overrated." "The ransomware epidemic alerted the world."\n\nSome, all, or none of these may be true, but the summary provides a useful compendium of speculation about the failure of large-scale, devastating cyberattacks to materialize.\n\nAlternative energy suppliers in Europe sustain cyberattacks.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that three alternative energy companies in Europe have sustained cyberattacks since Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine began. WindEurope, a wind-power industry group based in Brussels, says it believes the attacks originate with Russia. Presumably the goal is to make a shift from Russian oil and natural gas more difficult for European, especially German, markets. Two German turbine manufacturers (Enercon GmbH and Nordex SE) and one turbine maintenance firm (Windtechnik AG) have been affected.\n\nDisinformation: forged document claims Ukraine is reselling military aid to African countries.\n\nThe Atlantic Council offers a debunking of claims in the Kremlin-aligned Telegram channel Rezident that Ukraine planned to sell surplus "armored cars, tanks, submachine guns, rifles, grenades, and bulletproof vests to African countries." All of that materiel, Rezident says, represents equipment Ukrainian forces need at the front, and the story has been amplified in other Telegram accounts as well as various Vkontakte pages. The document being circulated, and which is being represented as an official report from the Ministry of Defense to Ukraine\'s parliament, is clearly a forgery. It uses Russian orthography, for example, and it refers to organizations that no longer exist. The goal of the disinformation is to insinuate that Ukraine is beset by corruption. Rexident says “While Ukrainian soldiers are dying due to the absence of weaponry, clerks from the Ministry of Defense are selling it under the premise of redundancy,” and adds that the whole (fictitious) scheme amounts to a “cunning scheme of enrichment.”\n\nRosaviatsiya recommends that Russian airlines prepare for operations without GPS.\n\nIsvestia reports that the Russian federal air transport authority, Rosaviatsiya, has counseled airlines to be prepared to operate without GPS. "This is due to its possible shutdown, as well as "jamming" of GPS signals and spoofing attacks when flying in the Kaliningrad region, over the Black Sea, east of Finland and the Mediterranean." GPS spoofing and jamming have been reported in those regions by Western sources, and that activity has generally been chalked up to Russian operators, but Isvestia offers no such attribution. RIA Novosti cites Roskosmos to the effect that it would be difficult to selectively turn GPS off in Russia, and that in any case GLONASS offers a viable alternative to GPS.', 'image': 'https://thecyberwire.com/images/social-media/articles/pro/cw-pro-image-25.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:58'}

"Russian forces are likely attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the east of Ukraine. The city of Kreminna has reportedly fallen and heavy fighting is reported south of Izium, as Russian forces attempt to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east. Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south."\n\nUkraine has apparently taken the war to Russia with what are generally thought to have been strikes against two fuel facilities in the Russian city of Bryansk. The Telegraph reports (with video) that the installations (about seventy kilometers from the Ukrainian border) that informed speculation holds that the fires were caused either by a Ukrainian special forces raid or by a Ukrainian Tochka missile. The incident represents the seventh apparent Ukrainian strike at targets in Russia.\n\nThere are also reports of minor attacks in Transdnistria, a Moldovan province Russia detached as a nominally independent (but generally unrecognized) country. Russia, Moldova, and Ukraine point with alarm to the incident, and Russia and Ukraine accuse one other of mounting a provocation intended to expand Russia\'s war. The targets were two antennas in Tiraspol that were associated with pro-Russian radio stations.\n\nForeign Minister Lavrov warns that there are limits to Russia\'s good will.\n\nHe was speaking mendaciously, but without irony. "Goodwill has its limits," the Telegraph quotes Mr. Lavrov as saying in a Russian television interview. "But if it isn\'t reciprocal, that doesn\'t help the negotiation process." He was objecting to what he characterized as Ukrainian bad faith in negotiations aimed at ending Russia\'s war of aggression. He also pointed with grim regret at the possibility of nuclear war, which of course (he said) Russia doesn\'t want. The US characterized Mr. Lavrov\'s remarks as "escalatory rhetoric."\n\nMr. Lavrov\'s remarks came after US Secretary of Defense Austin said not only that he expected a Ukrainian victory, and that the US supported Ukraine\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but that it was in the US interest to see Russia so weakened that it would be incapable of future aggression of the kind its undertaken against Ukraine. When asked about Secretary Austin\'s expression of US policy goals, US Secretary of State Blinken said, "I think the secretary said it very well."\n\nWestern governments generally interpreted Foreign Minister Lavrov\'s allusions to the risk of nuclear war as a threat, but have shrugged it off as they increase delivery of weapons to Ukraine. Britain has joined the US and Canada in shipping 155mm howitzers to Ukraine. This is a standard NATO caliber, and, when coupled with delivery of US Firefinder radars, strongly suggests that Ukraine is being armed with an effective counterfire capability that will give them the means of precisely locating and quickly destroying the Russian artillery that\'s represented the most destructive form of combat power Moscow has been able to deploy in a war it\'s otherwise tactically mismanaged. Germany, in a surprising move given Berlin\'s unwillingness to become more heavily involved in direct, lethal materiel support for Ukraine, has announced that it will send Kyiv Gephard mobile air defense systems. These will address the other principal Russian threat: air strikes, particularly battlefield air interdiction.\n\nMoscow has accused the US and its allies of waging a "proxy war" against Russia. "The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it," Reuters quotes Mr. Lavrov as saying. "NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war." The US has convened an international conference at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to discuss Russia\'s war against Ukraine. Breaking Defense reports that forty-three nations are participating.\n\nPlanting and eventual harvest as collateral damage.\n\nThe British Ministry of Defence situation report on Russia\'s war against Ukraine yesterday focused on disruption of Ukrainian agriculture. "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production. The Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20 per cent lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following the invasion. Ukraine is the fourth largest producer and exporter of agricultural goods in the world. Reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain. High grain prices could have significant implications for global food markets and threaten global food security, particularly in some of the least economically developed countries."\n\nNATO expansion.\n\nFinland and Sweden, Reuters reports, are expected to formally request NATO membership in May.', 'image': 'https://thecyberwire.com/images/social-media/articles/pro/cw-pro-image-26.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:05'}

The coalition seeks to be vendor neutral and aims to build close relationships with the US government.\n\nThe new grouping will promote security intelligence sharing among manufacturers. In the past, this has been hampered by custom technologies with proprietary firmware and operating systems, along with a lack of planning for security upgrades.\n\nThis has led to concerns that industrial control systems and critical infrastructure is too hard to patch or upgrade in response to emerging vulnerabilities or new security threats.\n\nCatch up on the latest critical infrastructure news and analysis\n\nGovernments are also pushing for more focus in security in critical infrastructure, through programs such as the US’ Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative.\n\nConcerns about industrial cybersecurity are growing because of increased international tensions raising concerns that hostile nation states might resort to using cyber-attacks to disable or compromise critical systems.\n\nUnder the microscope\n\nMarty Edwards, vice president of operational technology at Tenable, a coalition member, told The Daily Swig: “With the ever-increasing number of cyber incidents being faced by critical infrastructure, governments and industry alike require additional visibility into industrial control systems and operational technology networks and systems.”\n\nEdward continued: “These are the highly specialised computing devices that underpin all aspects of our society – such as electricity and energy in general, water supply, transportation, manufacturing, and healthcare.”\n\nBaking security into the mix\n\nThe coalition aims to promote information sharing between industrial partners and government departments. It will also stress the need to build cybersecurity protection into systems from the outset, and to follow best practices thereafter.\n\n“Information about how these systems are vulnerable and threats that have been detected within them historically has not been shared outside of individual companies or tight knit groups,” explained Edwards. “In contrast sectors such as the financial sector have shared this type of information for years in order to make their entire sector more secure.\n\n“There is still a general lack of understanding about these somewhat esoteric ICS and OT systems that our society depends so much on.”\n\nAccording to Jon France, CISO of security body (ISC)2, teams managing industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology face challenges from both the lifecycle of OT equipment, and changes in how the technology is being used.\n\n“OT is an area that is getting a lot of focus recently with regards to cybersecurity. Generally, as more and more physical processes are being automated or digitised, something that has accelerated during and post-pandemic… it presents a significant threat surface area,” France told The Daily Swig.\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nLong technology refresh cycles, especially compared with IT, make it harder to improve the security of industrial control systems. At the same time, ICS and OT systems are increasingly connected to the public internet for monitoring and control reasons, a development that leaves industrial systems more at risk of attack.\n\nA lack of standardisation also makes it harder for security teams to manage and respond to alerts.\n\n“Over the last 10 years we have seen a dramatic increase in OT becoming part of our core fabric,” Anthony Holmes, a cybersecurity consultant and managing director at MODSEC, told The Daily Swig.\n\n“One vendor alone cannot protect this entire ecosystem. Each OT manufacturer has a unique OS for that device which in turn needs updating & patching. The complexity of these solutions tied to the critical systems they run and maintain are why this coalition is vital for the future of OT security.”\n\nAccording to Holmes, previous OT security initiatives have focused on vendor partnerships, but the coalition will make collaboration more effective.\n\n“It is a huge step forward to see hardware, software and in future, platform vendors working together to reduce the attack surface and increase operational resilience,” Holmes concluded.\n\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE Critical infrastructure entities on red alert over ‘exceptionally rare and dangerous’ ICS malware', 'image': 'https://portswigger.net/cms/images/74/bd/3a22-twittercard-220425-ot-coalition-main-image.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:42'}

Almost half of the respondents said that the industrial control systems were most frequently attacked.\n\nAnalysts say that the impacts of these attacks can range from company stocks being shorted or the lives of workers being put in danger when crucial operating systems are hacked to something as simple as assay results getting delayed.\n\nRELATED: Ransomware attack on mining operations “almost inevitable,” says cybersecurity expert\n\nFor instance, in the last five months British Columbia-based PJX Resources (TSXV: PJX) and Getchell Gold (US-OTC: GGLDF) in Nevada reported delays in receiving their assays as the Bureau Veritas Laboratory in Nevada was recovering from a cyber-attack that hit the company in November last year.\n\nNadine Miller, an engineer who has worked in mining for over two decades and is currently vice-president of project development at JDS Energy & Mining, notes that the industry has a tradition of being late adaptors to new technologies and is now also lagging behind in cyber security.\n\n“We are always in a race to be the first ones to be last in new technologies,” Miller told The Northern Miner, adding that mining companies generally don’t want to be early adaptors of any technology. “There are a few that will do it,” she said, adding they are usually larger companies.\n\nMiller says that while the mining industry has done a good job in securing its information technology (IT) systems, which include network infrastructures, file shares or employee laptops and computers, the operational technology (OT) – which, for example, involves systems responsible for process plants, refineries, heating or ventilation in underground mines – are not secure.\n\nBryan Tan, an Associate partner at EY’s cyber security practice says that ransomware, a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid, is one of the “key threats” in the industry right now.\n\n“A lot of organizations… put the OT systems on the same network as the IT systems,” he told The Northern Miner. “That starts to spread on the environment in the IT side, but because it can touch the OT systems, it can potentially impact those as well. From more of a business impact, your OT comes to a standstill and that may lead to life-threatening issues as well,” he explained.\n\nAI technology\n\nTo tackle OT-related issues, JDS and Miller are promoting a new technology, based on artificial intelligence machine learning (AI/ML), that they say can detect abnormalities in industrial control systems.\n\nMiller’s JDS colleague Joe Weiss, a global expert on industrial control systems, says that mining companies, like firms from other industries, depend upon sensors to run their operations. These can be hacked when connected to the web, a network, Bluetooth access via mobile devices, or simply a handheld calibration unit, and end up providing faulty signals that could, for instance, overheat or cool systems and damage them.\n\n“The JDS technology can tell you if the sensors are not doing exactly what they should be or if they are inoperable,” explains Weiss. “The sensors are the input to everything you do… the technology is making sure that the input going to the brain, is actually coming from the sensors and that we know how good the sensors are. And if (they’re) not, when we need to do maintenance for the sensors.”\n\nTo further explain the role that sensors play, Miller and Weiss referred to the Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station in the United States which overtopped in 2005 when water continued to be pumped from the lower reservoir even after the upper reservoir was full. While no deaths were reported during the event that wasn’t related to cyber-threat, the flood destroyed many structures in a park.\n\nAccording to Weiss, the attachments holding the sensors at Taum Sauk dam failed. Although they were detached from the wall and ended up at a different location, they continued to work. “They inadvertently told the system that the level was low,” said Weiss. As a result, the pumps were instructed to fill the reservoir. The JDS technology would have noted the change in the level and instructed the operator to check the problem, which is what makes the tool unique, he added.\n\nThe technology was installed in a refinery project this year, Miller said (the name of the company was not disclosed). Aside from providing protection against hacking, it also helped in detecting operational anomalies once the AI/ML went live, she said.\n\n“While the AI was learning their system, one of their engineers figured out that the controllers in the circuit was not working. We weren’t monitoring the controllers. But he realized that there was a problem with the controllers because the AI/ML was learning and the AI was flagging anomaly in the data,” said Miller.\n\nInvestment needed\n\nEY’s Tan believes that the mining industry has “moved forward” and is a lot more willing than before to improve its cyber security environment. But he also says that the industry needs to put more money into these initiatives and ensure that IT teams build stronger relationships with different parts of the business.\n\nAccording to EY’s survey, cybersecurity teams are struggling to build close relationships across the business — especially with teams that oversee the most critical systems and operational data.\n\n“The problem is that many chief information security officers came up through IT and, today, there is a paradigm clash between IT and OT,” the survey said. “On one hand, you’ve got engineers focused on availability and safety, on systems that are potentially decades old. On the other, you’ve got a CISO (chief information security officer) urging them to patch the system straight away because of confidentiality and integrity concerns.”', 'image': 'https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Engineer-in-control-room-scaled-1.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:49'}

Register today!\n\nA new report by Splunk revealed security leaders and teams are struggling to keep up with the more prominent threat landscape. The report — which surveyed over 1,200 IT and security leaders and practitioners worldwide — found that 65% are experiencing an increase in attempted cyberattacks.\n\nThis uptick is indicative of many issues facing the cybersecurity industry today, all of which are placing immense weight on the exhausted security workforce.\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge for organizations is the growing prominence of ransomware cyberattacks as they’ve made data breaches costly and draining. Seventy-nine percent of IT security leaders say they’ve encountered ransomware attacks, and 35% admit that one or more of those attacks led them to lose access to data and systems.\n\nSecurity teams are attempting to catch up, as 84% of organizations surveyed have developed a formal ransomware response playbook. However, nearly three-quarters did this only after they had been successfully attacked.\n\nThe pandemic, and subsequent growth of remote work, resulted in accelerating digital transformation. Most organizations use multiple public clouds today, and 45% of security teams say maintaining consistency across data centers and the cloud is their top challenge. Organizations must migrate data and applications to cloud environments to enable innovation and growth, and CISOs are under pressure to establish an approach that includes education, cross-team collaboration and security tools to deliver a unified security posture.\n\n\n\nIt’s even more difficult for security teams to keep up with the increase in attacks due to an industry talent shortage. Eighty-five percent of respondents say it has gotten harder to recruit and retain talent over the past year, and the issue is growing worse as skill requirements change at a moment’s notice. This lack of talent is having a detrimental impact on security teams with almost 75% saying that workers have resigned due to burnout, a trend many worry will be self-perpetuating.\n\nSecurity teams are keeping their focus forward, as 67% of organizations are actively investing in technologies designed to automate complex processes. This means fewer tools, less burnout and tighter action when the unexpected occurs: a future that security and business leaders should prioritize.\n\nRead the full report by Splunk.', 'image': 'https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1171809405-e1644422107326.jpg?w=1200&strip=all', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:06'}

It urged Ukrainians to stop fighting and give up their weapons, while claiming that Zelenskyy had fled Kyiv.\n\nIn the past, the principal domains of warfare were land and sea, where the protagonists would have some kind of early warning that an attack was in the making before it actually took place.\n\nBut today, cyber warfare is emerging as another domain and has become an important instrument in the global military arsenal. Cyber warfare accords a mechanism to destroy, disrupt or confuse enemy sensors, communications and decision-making machinery - often targeting a country’s critical infrastructure.\n\nCyber Attacks Are On The Rise, Globally\n\nProceeding the current situation in Ukraine, numerous high-profile cyberattacks in recent years have resulted in sensitive data being exposed. For example, the 2017 Equifax Inc. EFX breach compromised the personal data of roughly 143 million consumers, including birthdates, addresses and Social Security numbers. In 2018, hackers attacked Marriott International Inc. MAR, accessed its servers and stole the data of roughly 500 million customers.\n\nSeveral research papers have remarked that cyberattacks are expected to cost businesses and organizations $8 trillion by 2022, up from the $6 trillion projected for 2021.\n\nThe threat of the highest concern across the government sector is cited as ransomware, especially against critical infrastructure. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that threatens to publish erroneous data or blocks access to data or a computer system until the victim pays a ransom fee to the attacker.\n\nData Security Repercussions Of The Russia-Ukraine Conflict\n\nAs Russia expands its assault on Ukraine, governments across the world are on high alert regarding Russia’s movements across the military, cybersecurity and information domains.\n\nSeveral technology and cybersecurity companies including Microsoft Corp. MSFT, SentinelOne Inc. S and Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. CRWD have come forward to help protect Ukrainian systems and offer free cybersecurity tools and services to organizations who believe they may be targeted by cyberattacks from Russian-state hackers.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued official warnings to help stakeholders, including critical U.S. infrastructure sectors such as food, agriculture, electric, water and wastewater systems, to guard against the ever-evolving ransomware threat environment. As part of CISA’s Shields Up program these alerts are geared toward system administrators and other technical staff to bolster their organization's security posture.\n\nThe White House Administration issued warnings at the end of March, based on intelligence gathered, advising companies to immediately harden defenses against potential Russian cyberattacks.\n\nProviding A Key To The Solution?\n\nCybersecurity companies such as BIO-key International Inc. BKYI, which is in the business of providing Identity and Access Management (IAM) and biometric identity solutions, called Identity-Bound Biometrics (IBB), have reported helping companies reduce cyber risk by providing front-line defenses.\n\nBIO-key says its IAM solutions and award-winning platform PortalGuard® provide simple solutions to secure the modern digital experience with options for single sign-on, self-service password reset and multi-factor authentication methods. Multi-factor authentication is noted to be able to prevent cyberattacks such as ransomware by up to 90% and is at the top of CISA’s list of recommendations for blocking Russian-based threats.\n\nBIO-key also states that its IBB technology uses a biometric form factor such as a fingerprint or palm scan to verify that a user is an authorized individual behind a data inquiry, transaction or access request. This process eliminates the risks associated with the use of a password, pin code, token or other factors that can be compromised or shared among users.\n\nBIO-key reports that it has a proven track record of successful IAM project delivery and strong customer relationships in critical industries including supporting government organizations who provide critical infrastructure for countries across the globe.\n\nThe company believes that its unique value proposition makes it a preferred choice for helping government agencies and enterprises stay safe and secure.\n\nTo learn more about BIO-key, visit https://www.bio-key.com/\n\nThis post contains sponsored advertising content.

Now, less than two days later, SpaceX and NASA are preparing another Crew Dragon for launch.\n\nMonday\'s landing returned a crew of four private astronauts, whose 17-day spaceflight was sponsored by the private company Axiom Space. Since that vehicle\'s return, the manager of NASA\'s Commercial Crew Program, Steve Stich, said space agency and SpaceX engineers have been "poring over the data" on Dragon\'s performance during its return through the atmosphere.\n\n"It was a very clean flight overall, with really no major issues," Stich said Tuesday morning during a press call with reporters. "The team has looked through a lot of the data, and they\'ve had a chance to review everything. They\'ve looked at the thermal protection system. They have looked at a lot of the GNC (guidance, navigation, and control) data from the flight. Obviously, the parachutes were very clean this flight. The mains all deployed and went to full open, almost in unison, with no indication of any laggard this time, which was great."\n\nNASA officials were confident enough in Dragon\'s performance to clear a new Crew Dragon crew capsule, Freedom, for launch at 3:52 am ET (07:52 UTC) on Wednesday morning from Kennedy Space Center. This Crew-4 flight will carry Commander Kjell Lindgren, Pilot Bob Hines, and Mission Specialist Jessica Watkins, all NASA astronauts, as well as European Space Agency Mission Specialist Samantha Cristoforetti to the station. Weather at both the launch site and for the downrange abort zones looks fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive days after Freedom docks with the space station, the four members of the Crew-3 mission that launched in November will begin their journey back to Earth. This five-day handover will ensure a continued presence of NASA astronauts on the space station.\n\nThe return of Crew-3 will mark the completion of SpaceX\'s sixth human spaceflight in less than two years. "That\'s truly remarkable, because all of this has been done through the pandemic," said Jessica Jensen, vice president of customer operations and integration at SpaceX, on Tuesday morning.\n\nSpaceX now has a fleet of four Crew Dragon vehicles: Endeavour, Resilience, Endurance, and Freedom. Company officials have said that, for now, SpaceX does not intend to build any more Crew Dragons. On Monday, the company\'s director of human spaceflight programs, Benji Reed, said he thinks SpaceX can presently support as many as six human spaceflights a year. This is a likely breakdown of those missions:\n\nTwo NASA flights to the International Space Station (until Boeing\'s Starliner vehicle becomes operational, and then this number would be one)\n\nTwo private astronaut missions to the International Space Station, backed by Axiom Space or other private companies\n\nTwo free-flying missions, such as the Inspiration4 and Polaris flights\n\nJensen said SpaceX is determined to continue flying humans into space safely despite the rapid turnaround. "As exciting as this is, and as busy as everyone has been talking about, I just want to reiterate that safety is still and always the top priority," she said.', 'image': 'https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HD4ZFtJM-760x380.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:15'}

Last fall, a Russian film crew flew up, followed by a Japanese fashion mogul and his assistant. In each case, an active-duty cosmonaut traveled with them.\n\nThe latest guests were accompanied by a former NASA astronaut now working for Axiom Space, the Houston company in charge of the flight, making it the first fully private trip to the space station.\n\nAfter hosting longer than expected, NASA was itching to make room for the next crew. SpaceX will attempt to launch three NASA astronauts and one Italian to the space station as soon as Wednesday. They’ll replace the three Americans and a German up there since November who will head back to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule.\n\nThe pace is blazingly fast by NASA standards. SpaceX’s Benji Reed said the company launched its first passengers — a pair of NASA test pilots — two years ago and just completed its first private flight to the space station using the same capsule.\n\nAxiom handled the logistics for the trip for its three paying customers: Connor from Dayton, Ohio; Canadian private equity CEO Mark Pathy; and Israeli investor Eytan Stibbe of Tel Aviv. Their chaperone was Michael Lopez-Alegria, an Axiom vice president who flew to space four times while a NASA astronaut.\n\nIt was an “amazing adventure that we’ve had, even longer and more exciting than we thought," Lopez-Alegria said after departing the space station.\n\nAxiom teamed up with SpaceX for the journey that began with an April 8 liftoff from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. It was SpaceX’s second private flight, coming just months after a billionaire’s orbital jaunt with contest winners.\n\nWhile in space, the visitors did experiments and peered back at Earth.\n\n“It’s been eye-opening in so many ways,” Pathy said, “that I think will have such a lasting impact on my life.”\n\nThe experience was especially personal for Stibbe. He served as a fighter pilot under Ilan Ramon, Israel’s first astronaut who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003.\n\nStibbe flew copies of the surviving pages of Ramon’s space diary, as well as artwork and music created by Ramon’s children. He celebrated Passover with matzah bread he took up and gefilte fish offered by the station’s Russians.\n\nAxiom’s second flight is set for next spring as the company looks ahead to having its own space station by 2030.\n\n“There were a lot of eyes on this mission just to see if it was practical,” Derek Hassmann, Axiom\'s operations director, said after the splashdown. “Everybody understood it was possible,” but wondered if amateurs could pull this off with abbreviated training, without disturbing the space station crew.\n\n“I think we proved we could do that," Hassmann said.\n\n———\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The price rose from just under USD 30,000 at the beginning of the year, fuelled by tweets by entrepreneur Elon Musk, among other things, to its previous high of almost USD 65,000 in mid-April, before falling just as quickly to below USD 30,000 in June falling behind. Bitqh is a website that provides thorough information on bitcoin trading.\n\nGovernments and central banks are critical to developing non-government cryptocurrencies, while commercial banks are beginning to expand their cryptocurrency-related services. Therefore, the European Central Bank (ECB) is working on plans for its digital currency, the electronic euro (e-euro). What are the main differences between the concepts? And: Which means of payment will savers and investors rely on in the future?\n\nValue as a medium of exchange\n\nCurrencies such as the euro are means of payment that state institutions or central banks are tasked with safeguarding their value. It is different from cryptocurrencies. And that market participants attribute to it. Supply and demand determine prices.\n\nThat means: External factors can influence the valuation of crypto assets. Blockchain computing power and high energy consumption are examples on the supply side. Increasing marginal costs make bitcoin more expensive. It would be comparable to the ever-increasing expense of gold mining in mines or oil exploration. Therefore, inflation protection is often mentioned.\n\nOn the demand side, it is evident that the price is also driven by speculation (and not just by using cryptocurrency as a means of payment). It is the only way to explain the extreme price fluctuations and the significant influence of the Tesla boss’s messages via the short message service Twitter.\n\nThe counter-model: the e-euro\n\nIn contrast, the ECB plans an option with the e-euro, a means of payment. The digital euro would thus be a direct claim against the central bank and identical in value to the “analogue” euro. It cannot, therefore, offer protection against inflation.\n\nJust as the central banks see their money monopoly threatened by private cryptocurrencies, the commercial banks fear that the question of issuing the new e-euro will make them lose their heads. In theory, the central bank could issue and accept the e-euro directly to users without intermediaries. However, the ECB does not want to go that far: market observers assume that the ECB board of directors around Christine Lagarde will pursue an indirect model. So instead, the commercial banks manage the e-euro and issue it with an upper limit per user. With this integrative solution, the ECB would avoid another conflict with an already under pressure industry.\n\nOutlook: Security and trust will be decisive\n\nThe question of using these currencies will boil down to the criteria of security and trust. Anyone with essential trust in the ECB as an institution will also rely on the e-euro. Consequently, the ECB would then have to issue the e-euro directly.\n\nHowever, if the e-euro differs only slightly from the available digital payment methods, there is hardly any reason for consumers to switch. The initiatives of the ECB and other central banks to introduce digital central bank money (CBDC) are, therefore, certainly an attempt to sustainably invalidate the arguments for non-state cryptocurrencies for the digital economy and usage-based payment models.\n\nThe European Central Bank intends to present its decision on the e-euro before the summer break. Different interests collide. All market participants would be affected by a change in the monetary system.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the corona pandemic pushed the stock exchanges deep into the red in spring 2020 and investors secured their money from uncertainty about the new virus, the prices of shares and the like recovered quickly and rose sharply – even if Omicron probably experienced a year-end rally torpedoed.\n\nMany new investors saw the 2020 corona crash as a cheap entry point into the financial markets—more Germans than they have flocked to the stock exchange in two decades. Share prices have again increased significantly since the beginning of the year. The book profits of investors are likely to be considerable at times. Anyone who got on board in January and didn’t let the uncertainties surrounding delivery bottlenecks and new corona worries unsettle them was able to generate a decent return.\n\nStay updated with all the insights.\n\nNavigate news, 1 email day.\n\nSubscribe to Qrius', 'image': 'https://qrius.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-photo-843700.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:03'}

Register today!\n\nContinuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) company, Harness, has raised $230 million in a series D round of funding, valuing the company at a hefty $3.7 billion.\n\nCI/CD is essentially a combination of “agile” practices that allow multiple developers to push out smaller changes to a shared code repository and test for product-readiness before manually shipping the code into production environments.\n\nUsed by companies such as eBay and Capital One, Harness offers “continuous-delivery-as-a-service,” which leans on machine learning and AI to automate many facets of the software delivery process, monitor quality, and enable rollbacks to swiftly reverse changes that cause problems. Harness was cofounded in 2016 by CEO Jyoti Bansal, who went on to sell his previous company AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion, and who more recently founded another company called Traceable.\n\nWith Harness, specifically, Bansal and company are betting on the growing push toward agile software development practices, and the simple fact that every company is becoming a software company. This means businesses of all sizes need to ship code faster than ever, increasing the need for tools to automate many of the steps involved, and ensure that bugs don’t inadvertently find their way into their live codebase.\n\n“Companies want, and need, to innovate faster — to go from ideas to features in the hands of their users or customers, faster than their competition,” Bansal told VentureBeat. “Happy, productive software developers are the key to unlocking real innovation velocity.”\n\nYear of growth\n\nIt has been a busy 15 months for Harness since its last round of financing. The San Francisco-based company has outwardly embraced open source, following its acquisition of open-source continuous integration company Drone.io.\n\nHarness recently expanded into chaos engineering when it acquired ChaosNative; made its continuous delivery platform source available; and bolstered its broader platform with a suite of new features, including feature flags.\n\nMoreover, Harness said that its annual revenue rate (ARR) has doubled over the past year, while its internal headcount has nearly tripled to 700. With another $230 million in the bank — which more than doubles its valuation from its series C round last January — Harness is well-resourced to continue its push into the software development sphere with more features and tools — but what this ultimately will be, remains to be seen.\n\n“We’ve expanded our platform to include the entire, end-to-end developer experience — operations, quality, reliability, cost management, security, and governance — solving bigger problems for bigger customers, and helping them drive business outcomes through better software delivery,” Bansal said. “Our customers drive our roadmap, and we will continue to listen to them and invest in the platform.”\n\nHarness’s series D round, which includes $175 million in equity and $55 million in debt, was led by Norwest Venture Partners, with participation from Alphabet’s venture capital arm GV; ServiceNow; Menlo Ventures; IVP; Capital One Ventures; Adage Capital Partners; Balyasny Asset Management; Gaingels; Harmonic Growth; Unusual Ventures, Citi Ventures; Battery Ventures; Alkeon Capital; Sorenson Capital; Thomvest Ventures; and Silicon Valley Bank.', 'image': 'https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jyoti_Bansal_2014-COLOR.jpg?w=1200&strip=all', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:35'}

But the right mouse pad can make all the difference in solo or online play. Gaming mouse pads that have soft, woven-fabric surfaces are popular because they\'re affordable, comfortable to use, and easy to take with you for mobile gaming. Hard-surface mousepads are preferred by FPS players for their speed, though they are best for desktop-only gaming since they aren\'t as flexible as their cloth counterparts.\n\nExtended mousepads are great for keeping your keyboard in place while providing more room for mouse movements, while mini versions are best suited for mobile gaming or smaller desks. You can even get RGB-enabled mousepads to sync with your other peripherals and components to show off your personal style or match your favorite game\'s aesthetics. I\'ve gathered a list of the best gaming mouse pads available and broke down their features to help you find the one that best fits your budget and play style.\n\nAlso: Best gaming mouse: Click, click, BOOM\n\nCorsair MM800 RGB Polaris Best gaming mouse pad Corsair Size: 14 x 10 inches | Surface material: Woven fabric or micro-texture plastic | Thickness: 5mm | Base: Non-slip rubber | RGB: Yes The Corsair MM800 RGB Polaris is an almost perfect mouse pad that is tailor-made for gamers. You can get it with either a woven-fabric or micro-textured hard surface for speed, precision, and control, and the non-slip base keeps everything right where it should be. The mouse pad measures about 14 x 10 inches, giving you plenty of space to move your mouse, so you won\'t have to worry about messing up critical shots in online matches or missing tricky jumps in platformers. It features customizable RGB lighting and effects that work with Corsair\'s iCUE software so you can show off your personal style or sync effects and colors to the rest of your Corsair RGB components and peripherals. It even has a USB passthrough for connecting your mouse or other wired components to free up ports on your tower. Pros: Great surface area\n\nFabric or plastic surface\n\nUSB passthrough Cons: May be too big for some desks\n\n5mm thickness may be uncomfortable for some users\n\nOMEN by HP Outpost Best for wireless mice HP Size: 13.5 x 13.5 inches | Surface material: Reversible fabric/plastic | Thickness: 10mm | Base: N/A | RGB: Yes If you have a Qi-enabled wireless mouse, you need the OMEN by HP Outpost mouse pad. It features a wireless charging pad that delivers up to 5W of power to keep your mouse powered up between raids and even to charge your phone or other Qi-enabled wireless peripherals in as little as 2.5 hours. The mouse pad itself features a reversible design so you can choose between soft-woven fabric and textured plastic to suit your playstyle. It also features customizable RGB lighting to sync with your other RGB components or show off your personal style. It even has a USB passthrough for connecting wired peripherals like headsets, keyboards, or microphones without needing to take up a port on your PC tower. Pros: Reversible pad\n\nQi charging\n\nUSB passthrough Cons: OMEN Command Center app can be clunky\n\nNo anti-slip feet\n\nAlso: Best gaming PC\n\nRazer Acari Best hard surface mouse pad Razer Size: 16.5 x 12.5 inches | Surface material: Textured plastic | Thickness: 2mm | Base: Non-slip rubber | RGB: No For gamers who play fast and frenetic shooters or action platformers, the Razer Acari is an excellent choice for a mouse pad. The textured plastic surface provides enhanced tracking accuracy for both optic and laser mouse sensors than other Razer mousepads, and it is treated with an oleophobic coating so that oils from your hands don\'t slow down your mouse. Its larger size also gives you plenty of real estate to make quick or broad swipes with your mouse when you need to quickly take aim or change direction while chasing down opponents. The mouse pad measures just shy of 2mm thin, allowing your desk to feel almost completely flat for improved comfort. Pros: Perfect for shooters and action platformers\n\nOil and water-resistant\n\nGood size Cons: Thinness may not be to everyone\'s liking\n\nNot great for gaming on-the-go\n\nASUS ROG Scabbard II Best extended mouse pad ASUS Size: 35.4 x 15.7 inches | Surface material: Woven fabric | Thickness: 3mm | Base: Non-slip rubber | RGB: No An extended mouse pad is great not only for using a mouse but also for keeping your keyboard and other peripherals in place. And the Asus ROG Scabbard II is a top-notch extended mouse pad. Asus teamed up with the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists to create a specialized, woven-fabric surface for the Scabbard II which resists water, oil, and dust as well as providing a military-grade nano-coating for consistent tracking response. The Scabbard II measures about 34 x 16 inches, making it big enough for your mouse, keyboard, arcade stick, and any other peripherals you need to play your favorite games. The edges feature specialized stitching to prevent fraying and layer separation so your mouse pad can stand up to years of use. It\'s also only about 3mm thin, so you won\'t have to worry about a bulky mouse pad hurting your wrist during longer play sessions. Pros: Oil, water, and dust-resistant\n\nMilitary-grade coating\n\nAnti-fray stitching Cons: Only one design scheme\n\nCan be damaged by hot liquids like coffee and tea\n\nAlso: Best gaming laptop\n\nSteelSeries QCK Mini Best small mouse pad SteelSeries Size: 9.8 x 8.2 inches | Surface material: Woven fabric | Thickness: 2mm | Base: Non-slip rubber | RGB: No Not everyone has the luxury of a large desk for gaming, and if you prefer to play your favorite games on a laptop, you don\'t need a huge mouse pad. Enter: the SteelSeries QCK Mini. It measures about 10 x 8 inches, making it perfect for smaller desks and travel; and the soft-woven fabric paired with the flexible non-slip rubber base make it easy to roll up and place in a backpack or laptop bag for gaming on-the-go. It\'s also an exceptionally affordable mouse pad, retailing for just $7 so even the tightest of budgets have room for a quality mouse pad. Pros: Good for small desks and travel\n\nGreat price\n\nBasic, but still good quality Cons: No anti-fray stitching\n\nNot water-resistant\n\nWhat is the best gaming mouse pad? The Corsair MM800 RGB Polaris is the best gaming mouse because of its high quality materials, and tailor-made design for elite gaming.\n\nHow did we choose these gaming mouse pads? Aside from price, I chose a variety of sizes and surface types to curate a list of gaming mouse pads to suit a wide range of game genres and play styles. I also chose a few RGB-enabled models for gamers who like customizable lighting and syncing components for a personalized setup.\n\nWhich gaming mouse pad is right for you? Once you\'ve narrowed down a budget for a new mouse pad, you should measure your desk to ensure that the kind of pad you want is going to fit and work with your current setup. Extended mouse pads are great for keeping multiple peripherals in place, but aren\'t suited for smaller desks or mobile gaming. Hard-surface mouse pads are best suited for shooters and rhythm games that require fast, twitchy movements, while woven-fabric pads are better for lower DPI settings and slower-moving games like action RPGs.\n\nDo I need a mouse pad for PC gaming? No, you don\'t necessarily have to buy a mouse pad to get the most out of your mouse when you play games, but they do offer some benefits. A mouse pad provides a consistent surface for your optical or laser sensor to track as well as protects your mouse and desk from everyday wear and tear.\n\nHow often do you clean your mouse pad? You should clean up spills immediately. Not only will this prevent staining, it also prevents sticky build-up that can damage your mouse and make gaming uncomfortable. You should also invest in a lint roller to quickly clean up crumbs, dust, and pet hair that can gum up your mouse. Hard-surface mouse pads should be wiped down with a soft, damp cloth or disinfecting wipe once a week to prevent oil and dirt build-up, where fabric-topped mouse pads should be hand-washed in warm, soapy water only if they are very dirty. Just make sure you let it air dry and don\'t throw it in your dryer to prevent warping and fraying.\n\nWhat makes a good gaming mouse pad? A "good" mouse pad is a very subjective thing, but the best one for you is one that fits on your desk and gives you plenty of room to move your mouse. It also will have a surface that works best with your mouse sensor, preferred DPI settings, and provides comfort for your wrist and forearm. Woven-top mouse pads are better for lower DPI settings and games that require more control over your mouse, where hard-topped mats are better for speed.', 'image': 'https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/8cd7a474fa69e6e4fa0eb02ec385122ba027c4ba/2022/03/03/a791d3e4-988d-46c6-b995-c2e28ad8268f/gaming-mouse-pad-action-shot.jpg?width=770&height=578&fit=crop&auto=webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:16'}

The Honkid aluminum mouse pad looks like it was designed specifically for use with Macs, sporting a brushed silver aluminum surface, CNC polished edges, and a faux leather backing.

Pros: Sleek design\n\nPU leather back doubles as second surface\n\nAluminum surface Cons: May not work as well with older Magic Mouse models\n\nTextured surface may produce annoying noise as you move your mouse\n\nWhat is the best mouse pad? The Logitech Studio series is the best mouse pad due to its size, surface material, base, and price.\n\nHow did we choose these mouse pads? Aside from price, we tried to choose a variety of mouse pads at different prices and sizes. We also tried to find eco-friendly options for customers looking to make their work space a bit more green as well as hard-surface mouse pads for anyone who prefers those over the soft-woven kind.\n\nWhich mouse pad is right for you? You want to make sure the mouse pad you\'re looking to buy is going to fit onto your desk. An extra large or extended length mouse pad is great for larger desks and keeping your keyboard in place, while "mini" versions are better for mobile professionals or anyone who works on a tiny desk.\n\nHow often should you clean your mouse pad? You should clean any spills or splashes immediately. Not only will this prevent staining, but it also will keep your mouse pad from becoming sticky or attracting dirt that can ruin your mouse sensor. You can get a cheap lint roller to clean up crumbs and dust, and if your mouse pad is really dirty, you can hand wash it in warm soapy water. Just leave it to air dry instead of throwing it in your dryer.\n\nWhat are the best materials for a mouse pad? Soft-woven cloth surfaces are popular for mouse pads. Not only are they cheaper to produce, they tend to last longer than their hard-topped counterparts -- which can crack and warp over time. Metal mouse pads are available, which is great if you\'re looking for one that is going to last for years and is easy to clean. Though they will be a bit more expensive and, depending on their size, won\'t be as easy to take with you if you need to work on-the-go.\n\nHow should you choose a mouse pad? First, you should measure the space on your desk where you want to place the mouse pad. That way, you know exactly how large of a mouse pad you can buy and won\'t get any surprises when your new one arrives. You should also consider the surface material: hard-topped mouse pads use either plastic or metal, which are easy to clean but may not work well with all mouse sensors. Soft-woven mouse pads work well with just about any mouse, but they can be difficult to clean.', 'image': 'https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/be7a86cbace5a74f7d7aa5b78df9aeae5db1a0dd/2022/03/02/c6428674-235b-4dce-a48a-9e5ec67351a8/logitech-studio-series-mouse-pad.jpg?width=770&height=578&fit=crop&auto=webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:55'}

This makes Kraken the first US exchange platform to receive their full financial license from the ADGM, allowing them to operate a regulated virtual assistant exchange program in the financial free zone. Kraken met all approval requirements to operate as a multilateral trading facility and has officially established their Middle East headquarters in Abu Dhabi. According to an interview with CNBC\'s Dan Murphy, Curtis Ting, Kraken\'s managing director of EMEA commented, "We are delighted to have received full approval, and to soon launch regulated AED markets that will sit adjacent to Kraken’s industry-leading ecosystem of crypto products.

Kraken will become the first global virtual assets exchange group in the UAE to offer clients the unique ability to invest, trade, withdraw, and deposit virtual assets directly in dirhams. This will give Kraken\'s more than 8 million global users access to local currency in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, supporting their goal to facilitate access to global markets and global liquidity.\n\nThe Middle East attracts top exchanges\n\nA Chainalysis data study showed the UAE making up 7% of global trading volumes, ranking them third by volume in the region. As one of the fastest growing cryptocurrency markets in the world, the Middle East has caught the eye of several other exchanges looking to adopt a more "progressive" and friendly approach towards cryptocurrency business.\n\nFor example, Binance, one of the world\'s largest exchanges by trading volume, has started creating a presence in the Middle East. Earlier this year, it was approved by the UAE to begin operations and will be recruiting for positions in Dubai. Bybit was given approval to open a new Dubai headquarters in March of 2022 and FTX secured a virtual assets provider license, planning to operate in the country as well. Some other exchanges planning to expand to the Middle East include Crypto.com and BitOasis.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nKraken has officially become the first global virtual trading assets group to obtain its full financial license, opening doors to new investment opportunities and global liquidity for clients. With the Middle East becoming known for their more progressive outlook on cryptocurrency and their pro-regulation status, many big name exchanges are expanding there.\n\nLooking for an exchange to purchase crypto on?

From the rise of virtual worlds and immersive experiences to the explosive growth of social media, the internet has become a ubiquitous medium for communication and commerce. With the rise of blockchain, the internet is about to go through a major transformation.\n\nThis isn’t the first transformation of the internet. Since its public emergence nearly 30 years ago, the internet has gone through two major evolutions and is about to go through a third. These transformations not only have changed how we use the internet and what we use it for, but they have impacted the world at large, changing how we live and work and interact with others.\n\nWeb 1.0: The static internet\n\nThe first iteration of the public internet was the age of the website. Every company needed a website, and that website primarily contained static data and information that the owner of the website thought was important. The corporate website had information about the company—mostly marketing collateral. News and reference websites also had a stockpile of information. But all of these sites pushed information to the consumer—a one-way communications path. This was similar to how traditional media of the day (newspaper, magazines, radio, television) communicated information to the public.\n\nWhether the company was an existing news agency such as NBC or CNN, or was a corporate brand such as McDonald’s, every company soon had a website that conveyed information to the public. Figure 1 illustrates this internet. A website was an entity that a company created and owned. It had mostly static data, and the data was controlled and managed by the company. The information flowed in one direction, outward to the users of the website.\n\nIDG Figure 1. Web 1.0—the static internet.\n\nIn this model, data personalization was extremely limited, given the one-way nature of the information. Users could select and filter the information they wanted to consume, but they typically had very little ability to influence what the information communicated contained. Users had virtually no ability to influence other users. Information-sharing among users was typically limited to your local friends or bulletin board groups. These represented very focused and limited audiences.\n\nWeb 2.0: The web application\n\nThe second iteration of the public internet, the internet you’re using right now, is the age of the web application. Here, companies focus on providing a forum for individual users to share information with one another. Web 2.0 ushered in the trend of creating personal blogs, and later expanded into today’s social media landscape.\n\nCompanies such as Twitter and Facebook led the way to the democratization of data. They created applications that allow anyone to post virtually anything on any topic, and share it with a potentially huge audience. In our current iteration of the internet, illustrated in Figure 2, web applications and social networks, owned by companies such as Facebook, provide a forum for users to enter data into the application and share it privately with “friends” or publicly with anyone who might be interested. Today’s web applications allow people to communicate across the world with people they never met.\n\nIDG Figure 2. Web 2.0—web applications and user-contributed data.\n\nWhen the smartphone became ubiquitous, the use of the internet grew substantially. Now everyone could stay connected to the internet all the time. They could talk to anyone they wanted, whenever they wanted, wherever they were. The internet exploded.\n\nWhile users found they could communicate with people around the world, the companies who owned these applications found they could collect huge quantities of information about users and their likes and dislikes. This data became a valuable source of information and a major source of revenue for the internet giants. Companies like Facebook grew to be multibillion-dollar megacorporations, and the founders of these companies became some of the wealthiest people in the world.\n\nThen these companies discovered something else they could do—curation. Rather than randomly presenting information from one user to other users, they could use information they gathered about people’s likes and dislikes to cater information sharing to people’s interests. The “social algorithm” was born, and web application companies wielded huge power in influencing what information the people of the world received.\n\nThis control over information has made these companies enormously powerful—many believe too powerful.\n\nWeb 3.0: Authoritative data\n\nNow we are on the precipice of the third iteration of the public internet.\n\nIn this third generation, data is no longer stored and maintained by the web applications. Instead, data and information is stored in the fabric of the internet itself. In Web 3.0, data becomes available for any application that needs access and is authorized to use it. The data is no longer owned by an application, or controlled by a web platform company such as Facebook. In fact, web applications play a much less significant role in the management of the information. No single application can play the role of information curator, so there is no uber-powerful social media company to influence what information people are allowed to see.\n\nFigure 3 shows this internet. End users directly manage and control their data and information, and that data is used and managed outside of the control of a single company. The web applications are consumers of the information, but none of them own or manage the information. So the web applications are now of secondary importance to the data itself. Data and information instead is stored in a distributed blockchain that is not managed by any one single company. All of the information in the blockchain is distributed across all internet companies equally, unable to be controlled by any central organization (company or government).\n\nIDG Figure 3. Web 3.0—distributed, authoritative data.\n\nThe goal is to enable shared, uncensored, uncurated, authoritative information that is independent of web applications and the undue influence they put on the information. The information is owned and managed by the real owner of the data—the user—rather than by the web applications and their creators.\n\nThe result will be a more authoritative and trusted internet, because data will be sourced, referenceable, and uncensored.\n\nWeb 3.0 should create a more distributed power structure on the internet than was ever possible with the web platform companies of Web 2.0.\n\nThe value of blockchain\n\nThis revolution leading to the third generation of the internet is enabled by a single piece of technology—blockchain. A blockchain is central to this distributed, data-first, authoritative internet. What is it about blockchain technology that makes it central to this revolution? Blockchain has several features that will enable this transformation:\n\nA blockchain is distributed ownership. There is no single source of ownership for the data in a blockchain. Anyone can contribute to a blockchain, and anyone can read from it. Anyone can participate in the distribution of a blockchain.\n\nData stored in a blockchain is immutable, irrevocable, and cryptographically signed, so provably authentic and authoritative (or provably inauthentic and unauthoratative). Everyone knows who the owner and originator of all data is, and all data can be confirmed as to its source and authenticity. This increases trust in the reliability of the data.\n\nNo single company can curate, moderate, prioritize, or filter the data in a blockchain. As there is no single owner of the data, no one can manipulate how the data is consumed by users. This means there are no data power brokers, such as social media companies, that control and manage the information that is shared.\n\nIn short, blockchain encourages trust in data and its source by making all transactions transparent and data verifiable.\n\nBlockchain is similar to the IP transportation infrastructure of the internet—there is no single owner of the communications backbone of the internet. There are companies, such as AT&T, Verizon, Deutsche Telekom, and NTT Communications, that contribute to the backbone. But there is no single owner that can isolate, filter, or block internet traffic completely. Even powerful countries that want to block parts of the internet from their citizens, such as China and Russia, find the job to be a constant struggle. All it takes is a new, unfiltered provider to create a new communications path and all the filtering is worthless.\n\nBlockchain will accomplish for internet data what the internet backbone has accomplished for disseminating information. It will create a trusted, unfilterable, uncensorable repository of data and information that is accessible worldwide. It is this characteristic that will drive the creation of the third generation of the internet.\n\nAnd this is why the blockchain is the future of the internet.\n\nWhat blockchain means for enterprises\n\nThe most obvious piece of advice is to learn and understand as much as you can about blockchain. Please don’t confuse blockchain with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Bitcoin uses a blockchain, but blockchain is not Bitcoin. The value of blockchain goes far beyond the initial implementation used by cryptocurrencies.\n\nNext, realize that blockchain is not just a technology, but a fundamentally new way to think about data that will create a new iteration of the internet. It is as fundamental to data as the internet backbone is to information transmission.\n\nAs you start thinking about your future application architectures, keep blockchain in mind. Blockchain will be as important to the next generation of internet applications as the public cloud, microservice architectures, and devops are to the current generation. Make sure you consider the influence of blockchain in all of your application architecture plans for current and future applications.', 'image': 'https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/fintech_finance_blockchain_cryptocurrency_virtual_money_thinkstock_871491470-100749762-large.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85,70', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:15'}

The internet is now home to billions of people from all around the world, and every time they load a website, drop a “like” on a post or video, create a new account, drop an angry tweet, or do pretty much anything — they generate data.\n\nTo them, this means nothing, but for certain companies, this data is everything, and their very existence depends on collecting it, processing it, extracting useful information and statistics, and then selling that to other companies for targeted advertisement and increased sales.\n\nHowever, the problem is that all of this data that is so important for companies, and that even allowed megacorporations like Google and Facebook to emerge and dominate, is taken without users’ agreement. In fact, internet users — whose data is crucial for the survival of so many major firms — get absolutely nothing in return. This is something that Measurable Data Token aims to change by empowering users, and ensuring that the companies will have to compensate them if they want their data.\n\nWhat Problems Does Measurable Data Token (MDT) Solve?\n\nMDT is a project that aims to empower users and correct the current data-collecting methods where any data available is simply taken and used. It does this with a number of solutions that all create a reliable system where data sellers and buyers can exchange information in a safe and secure way.\n\nCreating a new data economy\n\nExamples of places where users are rewarded for providing data is very low on the modern internet. There have been websites over the years that rewarded users for completing surveys, helping the companies select products and designs by choosing between two different things on offer, and alike, but those were rare and they did not really make any sort of change.\n\nThe situation is different with blockchain technology, as the blockchain is very security and privacy-oriented. As such, it allows users to share data only when they want to do it, and with the entities that they choose to do it with. Furthermore, MDT also helps them remain anonymous as they don’t contribute data directly, but rather, they can deposit it in a big data pool that is then provided to the companies, all the while allowing users to maintain their own privacy.\n\nBut, all in all, the project’s goal is to create a platform where data sellers can offer their information to data buyers and be compensated for it.\n\nFinancial data oracle\n\nMDT also has a feature called Measurable Finance (MeFi), which is a blockchain oracle for financial data. It was specially made for the decentralized finance industry, and it contributes off-chain external financial data feeds to public chains. As such, it can empower the DeFi ecosystem with reliable data brought to the chain.\n\nA new approach to emails\n\nAnother product that can contribute to MDT’s ecosystem and fight for data security is called MailTime, which is an app that simplifies the process of sending emails. You might think — emails are already simple enough for everyone to use them, what more can be done?\n\nWell, the project believes that “emailing” can become as simple as messaging, essentially turning your official email inbox into a chat. Not only that, but the app is compatible with the largest email services, so you can use it to access email accounts such as Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, Outlook, or even corporate email.\n\nMeasurable.ai\n\nFinally, the project also offers a solution for data finers, called Measurable-ai, which offers access to transactional data. This is high-definition data that includes anonymized and aggregated datasets updated on a weekly basis. The project ensures that the data is 100% compliant, and it is estimated that this service will be extremely useful for emerging markets, such as South-East Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and alike.\n\nBenefits of Measurable Data Token (MDT)\n\nWhether you are an internet user looking to share their data for profit or a data consumer who needs it to run a business, there are benefits for you that Measurable Data Token has to offer, including:\n\nBuy and sell data\n\nMeasurable Data Token makes it very simple to sell or buy data. Users who wish to sell can simply contribute their data and earn rewards from it, while companies that wish to buy it can gain access to trustworthy, checked information that can help improve their business. Everybody benefits, but it is a better deal for individuals whose data is being collected and used.\n\nEarn rewards\n\nMDT has developed an app called RewardMe, which is a brand new reward app that helps people earn rewards automatically on the purchases they make. Basically, all it takes is for the user to set up the app and opt-in, and the data that they provide will be collected, anonymized, aggregated, and exchanged as big data. Meanwhile, the user gets a reward for their contribution.\n\nThe platform creates smart contracts through the blockchain to ensure that the profits will find their way back to the user.\n\nSecurity, traceability, and actionable insights\n\nOn the other hand, if you are a business, MDT will provide you with real-time data, in a secure way with data transactions being secure, anonymously stored, and traceable. Businesses can even set up their own data panel to answer their specific questions on the SKU level.\n\nHow Does Measurable Data Token (MDT) Work?\n\nMeasurable Data Token is a project that rewards users for offering data that is to be anonymized, aggregated, and traded to companies that depend on it as big data. That means that the companies will receive general information, but not private details of any individual user. So, they might know the statistics of which people from a certain country are interested in a specific product, but they won’t know them by name or what their address is, and alike.\n\nThe project has developed a number of tools for collecting data, processing it in a way where it is safe to share with third parties, and rewarding the users for their contribution. Meanwhile, it offers the companies a secure and reliable source of information that will affect their business plans, marketing strategies, and alike, but also prevents them from targeting individual users, thus leveling the playing field for everyone.\n\nHow to Buy Measurable Data Token (MDT)\n\nCurrently, Measurable Data Token (MDT) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nBinance – Best for Australia, Canada, Singapore, UK and most of the world. USA residents are prohibited from buying Measurable Data Token (MDT). Use Discount Code: EE59L0QP for 10% cashback off all trading fees.\n\nCoinbase – A publicly traded exchange listed on the NASDAQ. Coinbase accepts residents from 100+ countries including Australia, Canada, Singapore, UK & the United States (excluding Hawaii).\n\nGate.io – This exchange was established in 2013, and is one of the more popular & reputable exchanges. Gate.io currently accepts most international jurisdictions including Australia & the UK. USA & Canada residents are prohibited.\n\nMeasurable Data Token (MDT) — A project that lets you control and monetize your data\n\nMeasurable Data Token is not the first project that aimed to tackle the unfair data collecting, but it does seem to be among the best ones, with a carefully thought-out approach, plenty of tools for companies and regular users alike, and a growing reputation as one of the best ways to monetize user data around. It might set an example for future projects of this kind to follow, and we expect this project to find its well-deserved place in the future Web3.', 'image': 'https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/KqGSM2A.h-iG~1d34f/w:auto/h:auto/q:mauto/https://www.securities.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Measurable-Data-Token.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:16:44'}

Levinson said he believes millions of dollars in crypto-coins were stolen in this attack, including $87,000 from his own wallet.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Intuit and Rocket Science Group – a subsidiary that operates Mailchimp – of poor security practices, allowing this alleged heist to take place.\n\n"The hackers were able to access the Trezor email list (and likely other insensitive information) through Mailchimp and/or Intuit employee accounts," Levinson wrote in his 22-page lawsuit. "Indeed, defendants confirmed that hackers used an internal employee tool to steal data from more than 100 of their clients — with the data being used to mount phishing attacks on the users of cryptocurrency services."\n\nIt\'s said said Intuit "willfully, recklessly, or negligently" failed to put in place measures that would ensure people\'s data was protected and keep such a breach from happening, and then failed to disclose the breach in a timely manner.\n\nIntuit bought Mailchimp last fall for about $12 billion.\n\nGetting hooked\n\nThe lawsuit states Trezor users received phishing emails on April 2 that appeared to be legitimate messages from the company claiming that their data had been compromised and their cryptocurrency was at risk of being stolen. These messages were sent to email addresses stolen from Mailchimp.\n\nMarks were told by these bogus emails to go to what turned out to be a malicious website – suite.trẹzor.com, note the special ẹ character – to download a new version of the Trezor desktop software suite that turned out to be wallet-draining malware. According to the lawsuit, this was also made possible because an Intuit staff apparently fell victim to a phishing attack in which they inadvertently handed over their internal credentials to one or more fraudsters.\n\n"Defendants fell victim to one of the oldest cybertricks in the book: according to reports, one of defendants\' employees fell victim to a phishing email and clicked on a malicious link," the plaintiff claimed. "Accordingly, the unknown hackers were able to pilfer Trezor platform users\' cryptocurrency from the compromised accounts, resulting in millions of dollars of losses."\n\nThe lawsuit claims the crooks were able to view about 300 Mailchimp customer accounts, and exfiltrate data, including subscriber email addresses, from 102 of them. One of the customer accounts was Trezor.\n\nIn a statement to The Register earlier this month, Mailchimp CISO Siobhan Smyth said the company\'s security engineers first became aware of the security breach on March 26 when a miscreant accessed a tool used by customer-facing teams for customer support and account administration. Smyth said the targeted campaign "was propagated by an external actor who conducted a successful social engineering attack on Mailchimp employees, resulting in employee credentials being compromised."\n\nLevinson raised the March 26 date in his lawsuit, saying it was "a week before the phishing emails were sent" yet Intuit didn\'t raise the alarm until Trezor did so when it spotted the phishing campaign.\n\n"This lack of action was particularly concerning, as Defendants acknowledged that the hackers targeted customers in the cryptocurrency and finance sectors and that the hackers gained access to API keys for an undisclosed number of customers, allowing the attackers to send phishing emails," the lawsuit stated.\n\nLevinson wants Intuit to pay for at least three years of credit monitoring for the victims as well as actual and punitive damages and legal fees. ®', 'image': 'https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/14/pickpocket_shutterstock.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:01'}

They can be exploited in concert with other vulnerabilities that on their own are often considered less severe, with the latter giving what’s called local access and the former escalating the root access. From there, adversaries with physical access or limited system rights can deploy backdoors or execute code of their choice.\n\nNimbuspwn, as Microsoft has named the EoP threat, is two vulnerabilities that reside in the networkd-dispatcher, a component in many Linux distributions that dispatch network status changes and can run various scripts to respond to a new status. When a machine boots, networkd-dispatcher runs as root.\n\nThe flaws, tracked as CVE-2022-29799 and CVE-2022-29800, combine threats including directory traversal, symlink race, and time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. After reviewing the Networkd -dispatcher source code, Microsoft researcher Jonathan Bar Or noticed that a component known as “_run_hooks_for_state” implements the following logic:\n\nDiscovers the list of available scripts list by invoking the “get_script_list” method, which calls a separate “scripts_in_path” method that’s intended to return all the files stored in the “/etc/networkd-dispatcher/.d” directory.\n\nSorts the script list\n\nRuns each script with the process subprocess.Popen and supplies custom environment variables\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRun_hooks_for_state leaves Linux systems open to the directory-traversal vulnerability, designated as CVE-2022-29799, because none of the functions it uses adequately sanitize the states used to build the proper script path from malicious input. Hackers can exploit the weakness to break out of the “/etc/networkd-dispatcher” base directory.\n\nRun-hooks_for_state contains a separate flaw, CVE-2022-29800, which leaves systems vulnerable to the TOCTOU race condition since there’s a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run.\n\nAdversaries can exploit this latter vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with malicious ones of the adversaries' choice. To ensure Linux executes the hacker-supplied malicious script rather than the legitimate one, the hacker plants multiple scripts until one finally succeeds.\n\nA hacker with minimal access to a vulnerable desktop can chain together exploits for these vulnerabilities that give full root access. The exploit flow looks like this:\n\nPrepare a directory ”/tmp/nimbuspwn” and plant a symlink ”/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d“ to point to “/sbin”. The “/sbin” directory was chosen specifically because it has many executables owned by root that do not block if run without additional arguments. This will abuse the symlink race issue we mentioned earlier. For every executable filename under “/sbin” owned by root, plant the same filename under “/tmp/nimbuspwn”. For example, if “/sbin/vgs” is executable and owned by root, plant an executable file “/tmp/nimbuspwn/vgs” with the desired payload. This will help the attacker win the race condition imposed by the TOCTOU vulnerability. Send a signal with the OperationalState “../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc”. This abuses the directory traversal vulnerability and escapes the script directory. The networkd-dispatcher signal handler kicks in and builds the script list from the directory “/etc/networkd-dispatcher/../../../tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d”, which is really the symlink (“/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d”), which points to “/sbin”. Therefore, it creates a list composed of many executables owned by root. Quickly change the symlink “/tmp/nimbuspwn/poc.d” to point to “/tmp/nimbuspwn”. This abuses the TOCTOU race condition vulnerability—the script path changes without networkd-dispatcher being aware. The dispatcher starts running files that were initially under “/sbin” but in truth under the “/tmp/nimbuspwn” directory. Since the dispatcher “believes” those files are owned by root, it executes them blindly with subprocess.Popen as root. Therefore, our attacker has successfully exploited the vulnerability.\n\nHere’s a visualization:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo gain persistent root access, the researcher used the exploit flow to create a backdoor. The process for this is:\n\nCopies /bin/sh to /tmp/sh. Turns the new /tmp/sh it into a Set-UID (SUID) binary Runs /tmp/sh -p. The “-p” flag is necessary since modern shells drop privileges by design.\n\nThe proof-of-concept exploit works only when it can use the “org.freedesktop.network1” bus name. The researcher found several environments where this happens, including Linux Mint, in which the systemd-networkd by default doesn’t own the org.freedodesktop.network1 bus name at boot.\n\nThe researcher also found several processes that run as the systemd-network user, which is permitted to use the bus name required to run arbitrary code from world-writable locations. The vulnerable processes include several gpgv plugins, which are launched when apt-get installs or upgrades, and the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon, which allows running arbitrary code under some scenarios.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in the networkd-dispatcher, although it wasn’t immediately clear when or in what version, and attempts to reach the developer weren’t immediately successful. People using vulnerable versions of Linux should patch their systems as soon as possible.", 'image': 'https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/desktop-machine-760x380.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:17:17'}

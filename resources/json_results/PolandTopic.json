        "text": "Officials in Poland and Bulgaria say Russia is suspending their countries' natural gas deliveries starting on Wednesday.\n\nThe governments of the two European countries said Tuesday that Russian energy giant Gazprom informed them it was halting gas supplies.\n\nThe suspensions would be the first since Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that \"unfriendly\" foreign buyers would have to pay the state-owned Gazprom in rubles instead of other currencies.\n\nEurope imports large amounts of Russian natural gas to heat homes, generate electricity and fuel industry. The imports have continued despite the war in Ukraine.\n\nAround 60% of imports are paid in euros, and the rest in dollars. Putin's demand was apparently intended to help bolster the Russian currency amid the war in Ukraine.\n\nEuropean leaders said they would not comply, arguing the requirement for them to purchase rubles and then pay Gazprom violated the terms of contracts and their sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe \"Russian proposal for a two-step payment procedure is in violation with the current contract and bears considerable risks for Bulgaria, including to make payments without receiving any gas deliveries from Russia,\" the Bulgarian government said.\n\nBulgaria said it was working with state gas companies to find alternative sources to replace the supplies it gets from Russia via Bulgaria gets Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline.\n\nThe government said no restrictions on domestic gas consumption would be imposed for now even though the Balkan country of 6.5 million meets over 90% of its gas needs with Russian imports.\n\nPoland's state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop Wednesday.\n\nPoland not only has refused to pay for natural gas in rubles, but the country has been a strong supporter of neighboring Ukraine during the Russian invasion. It is a transit point for weapons the United States and other Western nations have provided Ukraine.\n\nThe Polish government confirmed this week that it was sending tanks to Ukraine's army. On Tuesday, it announced a sanctions list targeting 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom.\n\nThe Yamal pipeline carries natural gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, through Belarus. Poland has been receiving some 9 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually.\n\nPGNiG said that Russia's demand to be paid in rubles represented a breach of the Yamal contract.\n\nFlow charts published on the website of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas showed drastic drops of gas flows at entry points in Kondratki, a town in eastern Poland, and Vysokaye, which is in Belarus.\n\nThe Russian news agency Tass cited Gazprom as saying that Poland must pay for its gas supplies under a new procedure.\n\nPoland appeared to be the European customer to have its gas shipments halted by Russia.\n\nPolish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources. She said the country has been effectively independent when it comes to Russian gas for some time.\n\n\"There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes,\" Moskwa tweeted.\n\nThe minister repeated that message at a news conference, saying: \"Appropriate diversification strategies that we have introduced allow us to feel on the safe side in this situation,\" she said.\n\nPoland has been working since the 1990s to wean itself off of Russian energy and was already on track to end its reliance on Russian gas this year. It recently moved to stop imports of Russian coal.\n\nThe government in Warsaw has urged other European countries to lessen their dependence on Russian energy sources.",

The remaining Ukrainian forces in the city are holding out in a sprawling steel factory.

How can it be otherwise?\" Lavrov said. \"NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war,\" he added.\n\nIn another interview late Monday, Lavrov vowed peace talks with Ukraine would continue even as he warned of a \"real\" danger of the conflict in Ukraine escalating into a third world war.\n\n\"The danger is serious, it is real, you can't underestimate it,\" Lavrov told the Interfax news agency.\n\nThe foreign minister also told Russian state television that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of \"artificially\" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n\"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,\" Lavrov said.\n\nWhen asked if the current situation in Ukraine was comparable to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Lavrov said that \"back then there were actually only a few rules, written rules.\"\n\nHowever, Lavrov said that during that time, there were \"clear rules of conduct\" and a channel of communication between the leaders of the US and Soviet Union that doesn't exist today.\n\nThe foreign minister also criticized Ukraine's approach to negotiations following Russia's invasion of the country on February 24. Lavrov accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of \"pretending\" to negotiate.\n\nHe told Russian news agencies the content of peace talks would depend on the military situation and added, \"Good will has its limits. But if it isn't reciprocal, that doesn't help the negotiation process.\"\n\n\"We are continuing to engage in negotiations with the team delegated by Zelenskyy, and these contacts will go on,\" Lavrov said.\n\nUK defense minister promises armored vehicles with missile launchers\n\nUK Defense Minister Ben Wallace said the British government believes Russia has lost approximately 15,000 soldiers since Russian forces invaded Ukraine February 24. By contrast, Ukraine has claimed 22,000 Russian troops were killed since the invasion.\n\nRussia has acknowledged only 1,351 military deaths.\n\nAdditionally, Wallace said the UK believes Russia lost 60 jets and helicopters, 2,000 armored vehicles and 530 tanks, saying they were either destroyed or captured, some by Ukrainian tractors.\n\nUkraine has stated Russian losses of materiel at 181 fighter jets and 154 helicopters, 2,258 military vehicles and 884 tanks.\n\nWallace added Russia deployed 120 tactical battalion groups during the invasion of Ukraine, amounting to 65% of Russia's total infantry units. Wallace said at least 25% of Russia's ground forces are no longer combat ready.\n\nThe UK defense secretary said his country would soon send \"a small number\" of Stormer armored vehicles equipped with missile launchers.\n\nWatch video 03:55 Security expert: 'Sending arms is neither illegal nor unusual'\n\nEuropean Commission President addresses Russia on India visit\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in New Delhi that Russian aggression in Ukraine is a direct threat to European security.\n\nSpeaking at a geopolitical conference, von der Leyen said that Russia was: \"Targeting and killing innocent civilians. Redrawing borders by force. Subjugating the will of a free people. This goes against core principles enshrined in the U.N. Charter.\"\n\nShe added that Russia's \"unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine\" would be a \"strategic failure.\" She said the EU was \"doing all we can to help Ukraine fight for its freedom.\"\n\nGermany wants to secure the grain supply from Ukraine by rail\n\nThe German government wants to use rail transport to arrange alternative means of exporting grain from Ukraine.\n\n\"I am committed to ensuring that the 20 million tons of grain can be transported to avert a global food catastrophe,\" Michael Theurer, a Bundestag member with a role at the Transport Ministry, told the German business daily Handelsblatt.\n\nAccording to Theurer, talks were being held with the Ukrainian railways and other European railways \u2014 with Deutsche Bahn also set to play a role. Owing to the blockade of Ukrainian ports, it is not currently possible to export Ukrainian grain by sea.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine are among the most prolific exporters of wheat on the planet.\n\nOn April 23, Ukraine and Poland announced that they would create a joint logistics company to increase the volume of rail transportation of Ukrainian goods to the EU and world markets via Europe.\n\nRussia says Trans-Dniester hit with explosions\n\nRussian state-run media outlets are reporting explosions near a government building in the Trans-Dniester region of Moldova, where Russia backs its proxy forces who call themselves separatists.\n\nTrans-Dniester, also referred to as Transnistria in English, is a narrow strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River, sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova. The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the break up of the former Soviet Union.\n\nEarlier, Putin accused the West of \"terror\" while urging prosecutors to be tough after Russia accused \"neo-Nazis\" from Ukraine of attempting to assassinate numerous Russian state media personalities and bosses including presenter Vladimir Solovyev and state media head Margarita Simonyan.\n\nSweden and Finland agree to submit NATO applications\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti reports Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinisto is scheduled to arrive in Stockholm in the middle of that week.\n\nBerlin says Russia's expulsion of diplomats 'not justified'\n\nGermany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has condemned Russia's announcement that it will expel 40 German diplomatic staff.\n\nThe move by Moscow was said to by a symmetrical response to Germany's expulsion of the same number of staff from Russian diplomatic missions earlier this month.\n\nHowever, Baerbock said the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been spies, rather than diplomats.\n\n\"We expected today's step, but it is in no way justified,\" Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.\n\nBaerbock said that the 40 Russian diplomats expelled by Berlin \"did not serve diplomacy for a single day\" while those who were expelled by Russia had \"not done anything wrong.\"\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nRussia declares 40 German diplomats 'persona non grata'\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry says it has declared 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia \"persona non grata.\"\n\nIn a statement, the ministry said it had summoned Germany's ambassador in Moscow and handed him a note. The ministry said it was \"a symmetrical response\" to the German government's decision to expel 40 Russian diplomats from Germany on April 4.\n\nMoscow's letter of protest said statements made at the time by Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock were unacceptable.\n\nBaerbock had spoken of \"a significant number of members of the Russian embassy, undesirables who have worked every day here in Germany against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society.\"\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said it also objected to \"insinuations\" Baerbock had made about events unfolding in Ukraine.\n\nAn assessment by the German news agency DPA said the number corresponded to about one-third of the German diplomatic corps in Russia.\n\nThe RIA news agency also reported that Russia's foreign ministry has said that unfriendly actions against Russians will not go unanswered. It cited the ministry as saying Moscow could seize assets held in Russia as a response.\n\nGreenpeace activists chained their boat to Russian tanker in Norway\n\nGreenpeace activists in Norway have chained their boat to a Russian oil tanker in protest oil imports from Russia.\n\nThe aim was to prevent the shipping of thousands of tons of oil to Norwegian ports, Greenpeace Norway said on its website.\n\nThe four activists, who held up banners with \"Stop fuelling the war\" and \"Oil fuels war\" from three small boats and kayaks, called on the Norwegian government to halt the import of Russian fossil fuels.\n\n\"I'm shocked that Norway is operating as a free port for Russian oil, when we know it is financing Russian President Vladimir Putin's war,\" Frode Pleym, Greenpeace's head in Norway, said.\n\nPleym is among the activists who chained their boat to the Russian tanker's anchor chain off the Oslofjord terminal.\n\nNorwegian police later said they had arrested 20 Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion activists who blocked the Russian tanker.\n\nGreenpeace members, who had their boat chained to a Russian tanker, held the banners \"Stop fuelling the war\" and \"Oil fuels war\"\n\nEstonian PM urges Germany to act now, not later\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has told DW that her country expects Germany to show strong leadership and deter Russian aggression.\n\nThe comments come with the German government facing criticism over its reluctance to ban Russian oil and send heavy weapons such as tanks to Ukraine.\n\n\"Our neighbors' problems today are our problems tomorrow,\" said Kallas. \"If we don't help our neighbors when their house is on fire, the fire will also catch your house.\"\n\nWatch video 02:33 Estonian PM Kaja Kallas: 'Our neighbor's problems today are our problems tomorrow'\n\nKallas welcomed Germany's commitment to NATO's Article 5 on collective defense. However, she said tough decisions now could reduce the likelihood of an attack against the alliance further down the line.\n\n\"Germany has said Article 5 is ironclad and Germany will come to help if necessary, but then it is also important for everybody, including Germany, to make those decisions so that we make NATO stronger \u2014 and there will be no need to come to any help at all.\"\n\n\"Of course, gas or oil could be expensive, but freedom is really priceless,\" Kallas said, adding: \"Strong sanctions, hitting hard, would be something that would maybe end this war.\"\n\nNo agreement with Russia on Mariupol corridor \u2014 Ukrainian deputy PM\n\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that Kyiv had not reached any agreement with Moscow on establishing a humanitarian corridor out of the southeastern city of Mariupol.\n\nRussia said it would open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol.\n\n\"It is important to understand that a humanitarian corridor opens by the agreement of both sides,\" Vereshchuk said on Telegram. \"A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor.\"\n\nHead of Ukrainian Railways: We keep running operations\n\nIn an interview with DW, Oleksandr Kamyshin, the chairman of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said that five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were significantly damaged on Monday after the numerous rocket strikes.\n\n\"Today in the morning, the Russians shelled five stations.

But we keep running operations,\" Kamyshin said.\n\nWatch video 04:43 Ukraine's rail chief: 'We suffer much, but we keep running operations'\n\nAccording to Kamyshin, the railway maintains the \"lifeline of the country,\" because the air space above Ukraine cannot be used because of the war. \"We don't have airplanes. We have only cars and trains now,\" he said.\n\nThe still-operational rail links in the country have also come into political focus in recent weeks, with various foreign leaders using the trains to visit Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine.\n\n\"All Western leaders who arrived to Ukraine, arrived by train. [\u2026] We call it Iron Diplomacy, and we will keep bringing more people to Kyiv. For us, it's important to give the opportunity to those leaders who want to show their support of Ukraine by visiting Kyiv, to travel to Kyiv safe, and travel back safe,\" Kamyshin said.\n\nWatch video 02:41 Courageous rail workers keep Ukraine running amid war\n\nBiden names new US ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden has named Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine, the White House said in a statement.\n\nBridget Brink currently represents the United States in Slovakia.\n\nBrink's nomination must be confirmed by the US Senate.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that US diplomats would begin to return to Ukraine starting next week.\n\nWatch video 02:08 US pledges more arms funding for Ukraine\n\nNo southern Ukraine secession referendum plans \u2014 Russian Foreign Ministry\n\nRussia's foreign ministry has denied claims that Moscow is planning a referendum on the secession of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson.\n\n\"I have not heard anything about that,\" deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko told journalists.\n\nRudenko also said that a face-to-face meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers was not planned at present. Moscow has accused Kyiv of dragging out negotiations and claims to have handed over proposals to Ukraine last week, which Kyiv has denied.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday accused Moscow of planning to \"falsify\" a referendum in parts of Ukraine's south that are under Russian control after Russia's Central Military District (CFD) command said that Moscow was planning to seize the region.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Demonstrations against Russian referendum plan in Kherson\n\n'Right now I'm talking to you from a bunker' says DW correspondent\n\nDW correspondent Emmanuelle Chaze said that half of the $700 million in military assistance announced by the US will go directly to Kyiv, and half will go to NATO allies that have been supporting Ukraine.\n\nWatch video 03:21 Airstrikes near Lviv: DW's Jan-Philipp Scholz reports\n\nSpeaking from the western city of Liviv, Chaze added that $165 million worth of ammunition will be delivered to Ukraine.\n\nChaze said that the situation in Mariupol is \"dire,\" adding that Ukrainian soldiers and hundreds of civilians are still trapped in the Azovstal steel plant in the city. She added that there would soon be water shortages in the area.\n\n\"Right now, I'm talking to you from a bunker because most of the country is on air strike alert,\" Chaze reported.\n\n\"The offensive is continuing.

The ceasefire is set to begin at 2 p.m. Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Monday.\n\nThe ministry said any civilians trapped at the facility could leave in whichever direction they chose.\n\nOn April 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he cancelled plans to storm the Azovstal plant in Mariupol. He said he wanted the plant to be securely blockaded instead.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian fighters at the Azovstal plant reported heavy shelling and Russian attacks in recent days.\n\nAzovstal is the last remaining pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the key port of Mariupol.\n\nGermany's Steinmeier meets Ukrainian Holocaust survivors\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Ukrainian Holocaust survivors in Berlin and said that he hoped that refugees in Germany would feel safe from further attacks.\n\nSteinmeier met the survivors during a visit to a care facility in Berlin's eastern neighborhood of Marzahn.\n\nThe six Holocaust survivors told Steinmeier stories of their escape from Ukrainian cities, which in some cases lasted several days. The four women and two men were brought to Germany with the help of Jewish organizations.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the president's office, around 70 Holocaust survivors from Ukraine who are in need of serious care have so far been admitted in 11 German cities.\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Holocaust survivors in Berlin who fled Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia 'greeted' Ukraine on Easter with missile strikes, Zelenskyy said\n\nIn a morning video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia \"greeted\" Ukraine with missiles strikes over the weekend, when Orthodox Easter was celebrated. The majority of population in both Russia and Ukraine are Orthodox Christians.\n\n\"Why was this blow needed at Easter? There is no military threat from which this could protect Russia. This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the biggest Orthodox holiday,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also spoke about yesterday's visit by top US officials. \"Assistance to Ukraine was the number one issue in talks with representatives of the United States of America, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"We share the same understanding with the United States: when democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world. When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world,\" said the Ukrainian president.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskyy also mentioned the morning air raids in the Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv and Odesa regions. However, he did not provide any information on the rocket attacks reported at train stations in western Ukraine.\n\nUkraine reports deadly rocket attacks in central Vinnytsia region\n\nTwo towns in Ukraine's central Vinnytsia region came under fire on Monday, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, according to local officials.\n\nThe cities of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn were struck by \"rocket fire,\" local governor Serhiy Borzov said on Facebook.

The missiles flew to western Ukraine from the southeast, Kozytskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe added that the missiles were likely fired from Russian strategic aircraft. He had no information yet about possible victims.\n\nKyiv needs long-range fires and tanks \u2014 US Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed and that Kyiv now needs long-range fires for both artillery and missiles, as well as tanks.\n\nAustin said that he and Blinken had discussed \"security assistance\" and \"training\" with Ukrainian officials. He said that the meeting was to talk about things that would \"enable us to win the current fight and also build for tomorrow.\"\n\n\"We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,\" Austin said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke to reporters following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nAustin is scheduled to go to the Ramstein US Air Base in western Germanyon Tuesday to speak with allies on how best to support Ukraine.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense said it is difficult for the US to track what happens to weapons transferred to Ukraine as there are no US forces on the ground, but added that he spoke to Kyiv to make sure weapons were tracked as best as possible.\n\nRussia 'failing' in its war aims \u2014 Blinken\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press conference following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Russia has been \"failing\" when it came to its war aims in Ukraine, while Kyiv is \"succeeding.\"\n\n\"Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine,\" Blinken said. \"That has failed.\"\n\nBlinken said that Russia's military was underperforming and its economy was \"in shambles\" due to sanctions and a mass \"exodus\" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n\"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin's on the scene,\" Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees \"final success.\"\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said \"things are beginning to get back to normal\" in Kyiv, but noted that \"that's in stark contrast to what's going on\" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas \u2014 UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain's defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, \"Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough\" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine's defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means \"Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed.\"\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia's defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. Britain's defense ministry believes this \"reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia's losses from the domestic population.\"\n\nWatch video 01:57 Ukraine war: Russia's renewed ambitions in the east\n\nRussia increased military spending to $65.9 billion in 2021\n\nWorld military expenditure surpassed the $2 trillion mark (\u20ac1.8 trillion) for the first time in 2021, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe report released on Monday shows Russia increased its military expenditure to $65.9 billion in 2021 to reach 4.1% of its GDP.\n\nIt was the third consecutive year of growth and Russia's military spending. Moscow was the fifth largest spender in the world, behind the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nUkraine's military spending has risen by 72% since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. It spent $5.9 billion, or 3.2% of the country's GDP, in 2021.\n\nTotal spending in Europe in 2021 amounted to $418 billion, 3% higher than in 2020 and 19% higher than in 2012. Many European countries have contributed substantial military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, and third-largest spender Germany boosted its military aid budget to \u20ac2 billion a little over a week ago.\n\nThe United States saw a drop in expenditure in 2021 due to a drop in American spending on research and development. The US is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, having provided an additional $800 million in mid-April and another $322 million this Sunday.\n\nWatch video 02:24 US approves more military aid to Ukraine\n\nBlinken and Austin announce aid, diplomatic surge\n\nThe United States will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military financing and has approved a $165 million sale of ammunition to the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe announcement came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt was the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war.\n\nThe US officials also pledged further assistance worth $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries, with the $322 million earmarked specifically for Kyiv.\n\nThe new money brings the total amount of US military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said.\n\nThe two returned overland to Poland after their meeting. While Blinken was returning to Washington, Austin would head to Ramstein in Germany, for a meeting Tuesday of NATO defense ministers and other donor countries.\n\nWatch video 03:37 Zelenskyy hopes US Foreign and Defense Ministers bring promises of weapons: DW's Rebecca Ritter\n\nFire at Russian oil depot north of Ukrainian border\n\nA large fire was reported at an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk. The emergency services ministry told Russian news agencies it was a single large fire.\n\nIt was not immediately not clear how the fire started. Bryansk is located about 380 kilometers (236 miles) southwest of Moscow.\n\nThe city is the administrative center of the Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials on Thursday had said Ukrainian helicopters hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the Bryansk region.\n\nThere was no immediate indication the fire on Monday at the oil storage facility was related to the war in Ukraine.\n\nEU considering 'smart sanctions' against Russian oil\n\nThe European Union is preparing \"smart sanctions\" against Russian oil imports, the UK newspaper The Times reported.\n\nQuoting the European Commission's executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis, the paper reported that the precise details of the oil sanctions had not yet been agreed but could include a gradual phasing-out of Russian oil or imposing tariffs on imports beyond a certain price cap.\n\n\"We are working on a sixth sanctions package, and one of the issues we are considering is some form of an oil embargo. When we are imposing sanctions, we need to do so in a way that maximizes pressure on Russia while minimizing collateral damage on ourselves,\" Dombrovskis said.\n\nEurope spends around $450 million (\u20ac417 million) per day on Russian crude oil and refined products.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand show support for Ukraine at ANZAC Day commemorations\n\nThe leaders of Australia and New Zealand used their annual speeches on Anzac Day to show support for Ukraine.\n\nAnzac Day marks the anniversary of Australian and New Zealand soldiers landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in 1915 during World War I but is now used to commemorate troops from all conflicts.\n\n\"The invasion of Ukraine is a senseless act of war, one that is taking the lives of innocent people. It is a threat to the international laws that a nation like ours relies on \u2014 but it is also a threat to our sense of humanity. And that makes it a threat to all of us,\" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said\n\nNew Zealand was physically distanced from the conflict but \"inextricably linked\" to what it represented, Ardern added.\n\nAcross the Tasman sea, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the people of Ukraine, who are fighting a Russian invasion.\n\n\"On this particular day, as we honor those who fought for our liberty and freedom, we stand with the people of Ukraine who do the same thing at this very moment,\" Morrison said.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nSummary of Sunday's events in Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv. A senior Ukrainian official confirmed the meeting. Zelenskyy was expected to push Washington for more powerful weapons.\n\nRussia's forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol. Ukraine's armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing \"offensive operations\" at the Azovstal steel plant.\n\nThe UN refugee agency said 5,186,744 Ukrainians have fled since the start of Russia's invasion, an increase of 23,058 on Saturday's figures.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has said it is \"extremely concerned\" after several of its Ukrainian members were believed to have been arrested in pro-Russian separatist territories in the country's east. In a tweet, the organization said it was using all available channels to facilitate their release.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defense said Russia was planning a \"staged referendum in the southern city of Kherson aimed at justifying its occupation.\" In 2014, Russia held a sham referendum in Crimea to retrospectively justify its annexation of the territory.\n\ndh, si, lo/sri,rs (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

However, she will not be stationed in the country just yet, but will instead be making \u201cday trips\u201d from Poland to Lvov in western Ukraine until Washington reopens its embassy in Kiev.\n\nSunday\u2019s visit by Blinken and Austin was kept secret for \u201csecurity reasons\u201d until the pair had already left the country on Monday. The meeting also yielded a promise to send Ukraine hundreds of millions of dollars more in weaponry, including \u201cnonstandard ammunition\u201d and air defense system upgrades aimed at bringing the eastern European nation to NATO standards. The US has shipped over $3 billion of \"security assistance\" to Ukraine since the start of the Biden administration.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly condemned the arms supplies to Kiev sent by the US and other NATO countries, saying they only destabilize the situation on the ground and hamper the prospects for peace. It also insists that Western convoys become legitimate targets for the Russian forces once they cross into Ukrainian territory.\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.",

        "text": "This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo \u2013 to whom quoted text may be attributed \u2013 at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.\n\nIn response to the growing Ukrainian refugee crisis, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and humanitarian partners are appealing for increased financial support to help refugees and the neighbouring countries generously hosting them.\n\nLaunching an updated Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRRP) for the Ukraine situation yesterday, UNHCR and partners are seeking US$1.85 billion to support a projected 8.3 million refugees in neighbouring countries, namely Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, as well as other countries in the region, including Belarus, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.\n\nIt is launched against the backdrop of continued fighting, destruction and displacement inside Ukraine. So far, the war has uprooted more than 12.7 million people in the past two months alone \u2013 of whom more than 5 million have fled as refugees across the borders and 7.7 million remain displaced inside the country. Almost 13 million more people are also estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to security risks.\n\nThe human impact and the suffering already caused by this war are staggering. Families have been torn apart, houses and infrastructure have been destroyed, while the trauma of war will have a lasting impact on many of those forced to flee their homes, including women and children who represent some 90 per cent of those forced to flee.\n\nSince the onset of the war, countries in the region have continued to keep their borders open and to welcome refugees. The mobilization of national authorities, host communities, grassroots organizations and tens of thousands of volunteers across neighbouring countries and beyond has been remarkable and shows what can be achieved with a \u201cwhole-of-society\u201d approach, and in the spirit of the Global Compact on Refugees.\n\nUnder the leadership of various host country governments, the RRP brings together 142 organizations including UN agencies, the IFRC and national Red Cross societies, national and international NGOs, faith-based institutions, civil society and academia.\n\nIt focuses on key sectors including protection, food security, health and nutrition, education, basic needs, water, sanitation and hygiene, livelihoods and resilience, energy and environment and logistics. Transitional cash assistance, which has already benefited tens of thousands of refugees in neighbouring countries, is a key priority in providing dignified assistance to refugees.\n\nThis plan aims to ensure that all refugees fleeing Ukraine have access to safety and international protection. It aims to ensure timely and life-saving humanitarian assistance to refugees fleeing Ukraine and third-country nationals, of whom a sizeable number would need international protection. The plan also focuses on solutions through the promotion of social and economic opportunities.\n\nNeighbouring host countries have existing mechanisms and capacities to respond. However, the scale of refugee arrivals and the breadth of their needs requires further support for national social protection systems and services.\n\nNational authorities and regional institutions have moved quickly to ensure temporary protection throughout Europe and beyond in the spirit of solidarity and responsibility sharing. Robust and flexible funding will be crucial to sustaining this solidarity and reaffirming support for the continued protection and inclusion of refugees.\n\nUntil we see an end to this war, humanitarian needs will continue to grow and displacement will not cease.\n\nFor more information on this topic, please contact:\n\nIn Geneva: Shabia Mantoo, mantoo@unhcr.org +41 79 337 76 50\n\nIn Warsaw: Rafa\u0142 Kostrzynski, kostrzy@unhcr.org +48 788 224 010\n\nIn Budapest: Zoran Stevanovic, stevanoz@unhcr.org +36 305 309 633\n\nIn Chisinau: Moldova: Kisut Gebreegziabher, gegziabk@unhcr.org +37 367 722 468\n\nIn Bucharest: Gabriela Leu, leu@unhcr.org +40 722 212 097",

Here are the highlights of events in Ukraine over the past 24 hours:\n\nFive victims of attacks on railway stations\n\nAt least five people have been killed and 18 injured in Russian missile strikes at five railway stations in central Ukraine's Vinnytsia region, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office said.\n\nThe US wants a \"weakened\" Russia\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hopes the war in Ukraine will make it difficult for the Russian military. \"We want to see Russia weakened to the point that it cannot do the things it did during the invasion of Ukraine,\" he said after a visit to Kyiv with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Ukraine can win the war if it has the \"right equipment\", he added.\n\nAustin and Blinken pledged 0 million in additional military aid during their visit.\n\nRussia warns of real danger from World War III\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has warned that there is a \"real\" danger of an outbreak of World War III as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. \"The danger is serious, it's real, you can't underestimate it,\" he told Interfax.\n\nPeace talks to continue\n\nPeace talks with Ukraine will continue, Lavrov added. He criticized Kyiv's approach to the talks and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of \"pretending\" to negotiate. \"Goodwill has its limits. But if it is not reciprocal, it does not help the negotiation process,\" he said.\n\nUS ambassadors and consuls will return to Kyiv\n\nBlinken confirmed that US diplomats withdrawn from Ukraine at the start of the Russian invasion would gradually return to Kyiv. US President Joe Biden has nominated Foreign Service Officer Bridget Brink as the next US ambassador.\n\nSeveral European countries have also reopened their embassies in Kyiv after Russia withdrew its troops from the region.\n\nThere is no deal for Mariupol\n\nThe Russian military says Kyiv has prevented the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, where Ukrainian forces have barricaded themselves in the besieged port city, despite announcing a unilateral ceasefire. According to Ukraine, however, Moscow has not agreed to its request to evacuate wounded soldiers and civilians.\n\nPutin congratulated Macron\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron on his victory over far-right candidate Marin Le Pen, who is considered closer to Moscow.\n\nICC joins investigation into crimes in Ukraine\n\nThe Attorney General of the International Criminal Court will join the EU investigation team to investigate possible international crimes committed in Ukraine. This is the first time that its representatives have participated in a joint international investigation.\n\nExpelled German diplomats\n\nMoscow expelled 40 German diplomats after Berlin declared 40 Russian diplomats persona non grata earlier this month.\n\nBritish missiles against Russia\n\nThe Minister of Defense of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace assured that London will send to Ukraine armored vehicles that can fire missiles at Russian warplanes.\n\nRussia claims to have shot down Ukrainian drones\n\nThe governor of Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, said Russian forces had shot down two Ukrainian drones near the border between the two countries, in the Rylsk region of Kursk. Two people were injured in a village in Russia's Belgorod region as a result of Ukrainian strikes, the village mayor said.\n\n5.2 million refugees\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled their country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago. More than 45,000 have left in the last 24 hours, the UN said.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\n\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 - Novinite.bg\n\n/BGNES",

        "text": "ANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 A Turkish court on Monday sentenced prominent Turkish civil rights activist and philanthropist Osman Kavala to life in prison without parole, finding him guilty of attempting to overthrow the government with mass protests in 2013. Western governments and rights groups strongly criticized the ruling, with one calling it \u201ca travesty of justice of spectacular proportions.\u201d\n\nThe court in Istanbul also sentenced seven other defendants, including 71-year-old architect Mucella Yapici, to 18 years in prison each for \u201caiding\u201d the attempt. It ordered that the activists, who were not in custody, be immediately arrested, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\n\nThe verdict, which is likely to harm Turkey's ties with Western nations, comes as Europe\u2019s top human rights body, the Council of Europe, launched infringement procedures against Turkey for refusing to abide by a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which in 2019 called for Kavala\u2019s release on grounds that his rights had been violated.\n\nKavala, 64, has been jailed in Silivri prison, on the outskirts of Istanbul, since he was detained Oct. 18, 2017, accused of financing the protests. He and other defendants denied all the accusations and are expected to appeal the verdicts.\n\nHuman rights groups say Kavala was prosecuted with flimsy evidence and that the case is politically motivated. Kavala is the founder of a nonprofit organization, Anadolu Kultur, which focuses on cultural and artistic projects promoting peace and dialogue.\n\nSupporters of Kavala and the seven other defendants immediately protested the verdicts Monday, shouting slogans in support of the 2013 protests that morphed from a dispute over building a mall in an Istanbul park into wider demonstrations against the government of then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the verdict \u201cblatantly contradicts the constitutional standards and international obligations that Turkey commits itself to as a member of the Council of Europe and EU accession candidate.\u201d\n\n\"We expect Osman Kavala to be released immediately -- the European Court of Human Rights has bindingly obliged Turkey to do so,\u201c Baerbock said.\n\nThe rights group PEN America called the verdict a \u201cdark moment for Turkey\u201d while Nils Muiznieks, Amnesty International\u2019s director for Europe, said it amounted to a \u201ctravesty of justice of spectacular proportions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision defies all logic. The prosecuting authorities have repeatedly failed to provide any evidence that substantiates the baseless charges of attempting to overthrow the government,\u201d Muiznieks said in a statement. \"We continue to call for Osman Kavala\u2019s and his co-defendants\u2019 immediate release as they appeal these draconian verdicts.\u201d\n\nOzgur Ozel, an opposition legislator whose party frequently questions the independence of Turkey's courts, accused the judiciary of allegedly meeting the wishes of Erdogan, who is now president.\n\n\u201cJustice did not prevail here today \u2014 the will of the person who rules this country was carried out,\u201d he told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\nOzel also denounced the trial as an attempt by Erdogan to \u201cdemonize the protests that were extremely peaceful and were staged out of environmental concerns.\"\n\nAsked for his final words in court on Monday, Kavala said: \u201cThe aggravated life sentence demanded against me is an assassination that cannot be explained through legal reasons,\u201d according to the Media and Law Studies Association group which has been monitoring the trial.\n\nIn his defense statements Friday, Kavala rejected the accusations once again, insisting that he had merely taken pastries and face masks to the protesters. He said allegations that he directed the protests are \u201cnot plausible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that I spent 4.5 years of my life in prison is an irreparable loss for me. My only consolation is the possibility that my experience will contribute to a better understanding of the grave problems of the judiciary,\u201d Kavala told the court by videoconference from Silivri.\n\nKavala was initially acquitted in February 2020 of charges that connected him with the 2013 Gezi Park protests. As supporters awaited his release, Kavala was rearrested on new charges linking him to Turkey's 2016 coup attempt. The acquittal was later overturned and the case was merged with that relating to the coup attempt, which the Turkish government blames on the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies any links to the attempted coup.\n\nThe court on Monday acquitted Kavala of charges linked to the coup attempt, saying there was insufficient evidence, Anadolu reported.\n\nIn October, Kavala\u2019s continued detention sparked a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and 10 Western countries, including the United States, France and Germany, after they called for his release on the fourth anniversary of his imprisonment.\n\nErdogan has accused Kavala, of being the \u201cTurkish branch\u201d of billionaire U.S. philanthropist George Soros, whom the Turkish leader alleges has been behind insurrections in many countries. He has threatened to expel Western envoys for meddling in Turkey\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights\u2019 2019 decision said Kavala\u2019s imprisonment aimed to silence him and other human rights defenders and wasn\u2019t supported by evidence of an offense.\n\nThe lengthy infringement process by the Council of Europe, a 47-member bloc that upholds human rights, could lead to the suspension of Turkey\u2019s voting rights or membership in the organization.\n\nErdogan has dismissed the infringement process, saying Turkey would not \u201crecognize those who do not recognize our courts.\u201d Turkey had argued that Kavala\u2019s detention was linked to the 2016 attempted coup and not the previous charges that were reviewed by the European court.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

The issue stirred anger on both sides and threatened to damage trade between the two countries and undermine security cooperation.\n\nThe seven-member delegation arrived in Japan on April 24 for a five-day visit amid speculation that Kishida might attend Yoon\u2019s inauguration ceremony.\n\nThe last time a Japanese prime minister attended a South Korean presidential inauguration was in 2008.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.",

Yoon has expressed his intention to improve the two countries' ties, which have plunged to their lowest levels in years over disputes stemming from Japan's actions during its 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nTheir latest disputes were triggered by South Korean court rulings ordering Japanese companies to pay compensation for their abusive treatment of Korean forced laborers during World War II.\n\nDelegation head Chung Jin-suk told reporters after their meeting with Kishida that the two sides agreed to develop future-oriented relations for mutual benefit.\n\nKishida told reporters he will carefully assess the discussions with the delegation and the position of South Korea's new administration.\n\nJapan continues to insist that all wartime compensation issues between the countries were settled under a 1965 treaty and has accused South Korea of breaching international law. The row also led to trade disputes and threatened their security cooperation with the United States amid concerns about China's growing military strength and influence and North Korea's nuclear and missile development.\n\n\u201cIn order to restore Japan-South Korea relations to a healthy relationship based on Japan\u2019s consistent position, \u00cf would like to communicate closely with the new administration under President-elect Yoon,\u201d Kishida said. \u201cKeeping a promise should be the foundation of the relationship between the countries.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

It\u2019s not in bullets,\u201d Morrison told 2GB on April 26 in reference to the emerging field of cyber warfare, which has seen governments invest billions in counteracting increasingly sophisticated hacking activities.\n\n\u201cA lot of the focus has been on the nuclear-powered submarines,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the AUKUS agreement is way bigger ensuring that we have a comprehensive defence in modern warfare.\u201d\n\nThe headline initiative from AUKUS is Australia\u2019s potential acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines from the United States and United Kingdom, a highly classified technology that was shared only once to the British in 1958.\n\nIn this handout image provided by the U.S. Navy, the nuclear-powered fast attack submarine USS Hartford is moored off the U.S, Naval Academy in 1999 in Annapolis, Maryland. (Don S. Montgomery/U.S. Navy via Getty Images)\n\nYet, AUKUS has ushered in close collaboration between the allies in other advanced fields including quantum technology, undersea capabilities (drones), hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, and advanced cyber.\n\n\u201cWe prepare for these things to ensure we can keep stability and peace within our region. That\u2019s why we did the AUKUS agreement \u2026 That\u2019s why we drove the step up of the QUAD,\u201d Morrison said, referring to the security dialogue between Australia, Japan, United States, and India.\n\nThe prime minister said the efforts were designed to \u201ccounterbalance\u201d the expansionist activities of the CCP in the South China Sea and more recently the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe federal opposition Labor Party has launched an ongoing political campaign criticising the Morrison government for not preventing the Beijing-Solomon Islands security deal from happening\u2014a stance experts say is unrealistic.\n\nThe deal, in essence, would allow the CCP\u2014with the consent of the Solomons\u2014to dispatch police, troops, weapons, and even naval ships to \u201cprotect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in the Solomon Islands.\u201d\n\nIf fully realised, it would extend the reach of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army into the heart of the South Pacific just 1,700 kilometres (1,050 miles) from Australia\u2019s northern city of Cairns.\n\nMap of Australia\u2019s immediate neighbours in the western Pacific Ocean. (College of Asia and the Pacific/ANU/CartoGIS Services [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Penny Wong, Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, called it the \u201cworst foreign policy blunder,\u201d claiming the government\u2019s lack of engagement in the region opened the door for Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe government should have acted sooner. We live in a world where the strategic circumstances we face are riskier and more uncertain than in any time since the end of World War II,\u201d she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on April 20.\n\nMorrison however said he was one of the few Australian leaders to visit Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands in recent times, while also noting the opening of six diplomatic missions in the South Pacific.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned for all of the countries in the region,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 20 Pacific Island foreign nations \u2026 there are 20 areas which we\u2019re looking to ensure we counter that (CCP) influence.\u201d\n\nMorrison warned last week that Australia\u2019s northern neighbour, Papua New Guinea, was facing \u201cpressure\u201d from Beijing to consent to a similar security agreement to the one with the Solomons.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world to have an embassy in every single one of those Pacific island nations,\u201d he added. \u201cSo it\u2019s an area which is tightly contested, and we\u2019ve always been heavily forward leaning.

As the seasons there are the opposite of those in the northern hemisphere, the Solomon Islands could not be a more ideal naval base for distance training.\n\nWhether it is the Shandong or Liaoning aircraft carrier, they would no longer need to loiter in the Taiwan Strait, but could sail through the Bashi Channel or the Miyako Strait and head out into the Pacific Ocean. This move to boost the scale and strength of its military drills proves that China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army has adjusted its direction and resolve.\n\nWith the Russian Ministry of Defense having said that its Moskva guided-missile cruiser, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, sank on April 14, there is no end in sight to the war in Ukraine.\n\nAs it focuses on staying above the fray, China\u2019s ploy with the Solomon Islands is about bolstering its defense plans in the South Pacific. It is also a harbinger of Beijing\u2019s grand strategy and long game: The formation of a military alliance to take on the democracies of the West.\n\nAs an important stakeholder in the emerging dynamics of the Pacific region, Taiwan needs to be on its guard and make its next move carefully.\n\nShih Ya-hsuan is an associate professor at National Kaohsiung Normal University\u2019s Department of Geography.\n\nTranslated by Rita Wang",

        "text": "While the world focuses on Ukraine, the United States has abandoned the Middle East. Or, at least that\u2019s the story told from a steady stream of commentary bemoaning supposed U.S. neglect of its Middle East partners.\n\nFiras Maksad of the Middle East Institute, for example, dubbed the rift a \u201ccrisis\u201d in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in March calling on Biden to renew the U.S.\u2019s \u201ccommitment to regional defense by publicly affirming a strategic alliance\u201d with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, or both countries will continue to cozy up to Beijing and Moscow.\n\nOn CNN Maksad argued the United States was shirking its role as \u201cunderwriter of regional security,\u201d which, \u201csends alarm bells ringing both in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi and has them thinking about how to diversify away from the United States even further.\u201d\n\nMaksad\u2019s MEI colleagues, Bilal Saab and Karen Young, kept up the drumbeat in early April with a Foreign Policy article arguing for a new U.S. \u201cstrategic defense framework with the Gulf Arab states.\u201d The article followed an MEI policy memo accusing the United States of being supportive of Iran\u2019s expansionism which, amongst other issues, purportedly pushed Saudi Arabia and the UAE closer to China and Russia.\n\nNoticeably absent from these documents and media appearances clamoring for more U.S. military entanglements with Saudi Arabia and the UAE is any acknowledgement that MEI\u2019s biggest funders are the UAE and Saudi Arabia. In fact, in 2017, leaked emails revealed a $20 million \u201csecret\u201d grant from the UAE to MEI.\n\nMaksad also has personal ties to Saudi and Emirati money as Responsible Statecraft has previouslypointed out. Maksad is the Managing Director of Global Policy Associates which, prior to RS\u2019s reporting, listed Teneo as one of the firms\u2019 clients. Teneo, incidentally, is registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to represent multiple Saudi and Emirati interests.\n\nThe Middle East Institute did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMEI isn\u2019t alone \u2014 Saudi Arabia and the UAE have funded a number of think tanks in Washington, D.C. In fact, the UAE is one of the top foreign funders of think tanks in the United States. While none of these think tanks acts like a \u201clobbying firm\u201d \u2014 as Saab himself explained to the UAE\u2019s Ambassador to the U.S., Yousef Otaiba, in a leaked email \u2014 these think tanks often spread pro-Saudi and UAE messaging and silence critiques of these Gulf dictatorships. All while masquerading as objective without disclosing their conflicts of interest.\n\nAs Eli Clifton and I argue in a Quincy Institute report highlighting the perils of think tanks\u2019 donor secrecy, it\u2019s not enough for think tanks to just provide a list of donors on their website \u2014 as MEI does \u2014 they must also \u201cpublicize conflict-of-interest policies and proactively identify the appearance of conflicts of interest between institutional funders, or staff conducting outside political work, and a think tank\u2019s institutional research products.\u201d Claims of \u201cintellectual independence\u201d ring hollow when used to defend work products that serve the interests of top funders.\n\nMedia outlets also have an obligation to acknowledge these potential conflicts of interest. By failing to disclose these funding ties, Foreign Policy, The Wall Street Journal, and CNN are omitting critical information that could put these experts\u2019 comments into better perspective. If, for example, consumers of these analyses knew that MEI\u2019s top funder was the UAE, they wouldn\u2019t be surprised when none of them mentions the multiple times top UAE officials have been accused of illegally meddling in U.S. politics and elections as a possible cause of tensions between the UAE and the United States\n\nAt a time when the public\u2019s trust in government and media is near record lows, it\u2019s incumbent upon think tanks and media outlets to be as transparent as possible with the consumers of their work.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article has been updated for clarity.",

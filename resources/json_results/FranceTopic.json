Here are the highlights of events in Ukraine over the past 24 hours:\n\nFive victims of attacks on railway stations\n\nAt least five people have been killed and 18 injured in Russian missile strikes at five railway stations in central Ukraine's Vinnytsia region, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office said.\n\nThe US wants a \"weakened\" Russia\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hopes the war in Ukraine will make it difficult for the Russian military. \"We want to see Russia weakened to the point that it cannot do the things it did during the invasion of Ukraine,\" he said after a visit to Kyiv with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Ukraine can win the war if it has the \"right equipment\", he added.\n\nAustin and Blinken pledged 0 million in additional military aid during their visit.\n\nRussia warns of real danger from World War III\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has warned that there is a \"real\" danger of an outbreak of World War III as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. \"The danger is serious, it's real, you can't underestimate it,\" he told Interfax.\n\nPeace talks to continue\n\nPeace talks with Ukraine will continue, Lavrov added. He criticized Kyiv's approach to the talks and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of \"pretending\" to negotiate. \"Goodwill has its limits. But if it is not reciprocal, it does not help the negotiation process,\" he said.\n\nUS ambassadors and consuls will return to Kyiv\n\nBlinken confirmed that US diplomats withdrawn from Ukraine at the start of the Russian invasion would gradually return to Kyiv. US President Joe Biden has nominated Foreign Service Officer Bridget Brink as the next US ambassador.\n\nSeveral European countries have also reopened their embassies in Kyiv after Russia withdrew its troops from the region.\n\nThere is no deal for Mariupol\n\nThe Russian military says Kyiv has prevented the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, where Ukrainian forces have barricaded themselves in the besieged port city, despite announcing a unilateral ceasefire. According to Ukraine, however, Moscow has not agreed to its request to evacuate wounded soldiers and civilians.\n\nPutin congratulated Macron\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron on his victory over far-right candidate Marin Le Pen, who is considered closer to Moscow.\n\nICC joins investigation into crimes in Ukraine\n\nThe Attorney General of the International Criminal Court will join the EU investigation team to investigate possible international crimes committed in Ukraine. This is the first time that its representatives have participated in a joint international investigation.\n\nExpelled German diplomats\n\nMoscow expelled 40 German diplomats after Berlin declared 40 Russian diplomats persona non grata earlier this month.\n\nBritish missiles against Russia\n\nThe Minister of Defense of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace assured that London will send to Ukraine armored vehicles that can fire missiles at Russian warplanes.\n\nRussia claims to have shot down Ukrainian drones\n\nThe governor of Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, said Russian forces had shot down two Ukrainian drones near the border between the two countries, in the Rylsk region of Kursk. Two people were injured in a village in Russia's Belgorod region as a result of Ukrainian strikes, the village mayor said.\n\n5.2 million refugees\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled their country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago. More than 45,000 have left in the last 24 hours, the UN said.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\n\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 - Novinite.bg\n\n/BGNES",

        "text": "Receive the Transport Brief in your inbox by subscribing here.\n\nAs denizens of the Brussels bubble make their way back from the Easter break, the chatter around the EU capital has turned to fossil fuel sanctions.\n\nSpeculation is rife that within days, there will be an announcement of fresh sanctions targeting Russian oil, one of the Kremlin\u2019s biggest money spinners.\n\nWhat exactly will be announced is not clear. There are rumours that Brussels will impose an outright import ban. Others believe the sanctions will be lighter, consisting of new tariffs and a set phase-out date.\n\nThis lack of clarity stems largely from the political gap on the issue among member states. When it comes to an outright ban, Germany is still unconvinced (though its views seem to be evolving), while Hungary remains dead set against any embargo.\n\nThis contrasts with other EU countries who have shown significant willingness to cut off Russian oil, notably France. An emboldened President Emmanuel Macron, buoyed by his re-election on Sunday, is likely to push EU partners to embrace the concept with a renewed vigour.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to say what Brussels will ultimately announce, any sanctions on oil will almost certainly trigger further price shocks, which will be felt at the petrol pump and on the overall cost of living.\n\nLeaders have an unpalatable choice: stop funding Russia\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine through oil imports and accept the economic hit or jettison the EU\u2019s principles in the name of relative stability.\n\nIf a ban is announced, elevated fuel prices will compound the pain of the last months and are likely to foment further civil unrest (witness the mass protests against spiralling living costs that have engulfed Spain).\n\nTo soften the blow, governments may choose to keep petrol and diesel prices steady by doubling down on subsidies and price caps.\n\nThis is far from ideal. Not only is it essentially a subsidy for Putin until the ban is fully implemented, but it also prevents demand from dropping, thereby keeping prices high in real terms.\n\nIt additionally complicates government plans for carbon taxes and the expansion of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to road transport. Simultaneously subsidising oil to lower prices while taxing oil to push prices up makes little sense, whatever the original rationale behind both decisions.\n\nAnother option is to dust off the 1970s playbook and target the demand side.\n\nThose of a certain age may recall the oil shortage of the 1970s. In response to the crisis, then-US president Jimmy Carter encouraged Americans in a series of speeches to use less energy. Carter himself refused to turn on air conditioning in the White House and sold the presidential yacht as a symbolic act.\n\nHis message of energy restraint was not popular, and Carter was ejected from the White House after one term.\n\nIn 2022, European governments will likely hope they can convince citizens to change their habits by focusing on the positives of living a less energy-dependent lifestyle \u2013 lower costs, cleaner air, and better health.\n\nEnvironmentalists have been pushing such policies for years: higher levels of cycling, cheaper and more expansive public transport, a shift to car sharing, and lower speed limits.\n\nBut the reality is that telling citizens to drive less and use less energy is as likely to be unpopular today as it was some 50 years ago.\n\nWhatever the path taken, Europe\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels \u2013 particularly from an unstable neighbour \u2013 must come to an end, both for geopolitical and climate reasons.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion has merely hastened Europe\u2019s energy reckoning.\n\nToday\u2019s edition is powered by Global Mobility Call.\n\n\u201cSafe and Clean Road Transport. Always. Everywhere.\u201d\n\nGlobal Mobility Call is the world\u2019s most important event for sustainable mobility, contributing to post-pandemic economic and social recovery, and energy resilience. Leaders involved in sustainable mobility policies and business initiatives will meet in Madrid on 14-16 June 2022.\n\nRegister Here >>\n\nEU Battery Regulation to be agreed by summer\n\nThe EU\u2019s mammoth battery regulation, which covers everything from the extraction of raw materials to collection and recycling targets, is currently being debated by the European Parliament and Council.\n\nThe legislation seeks to make European batteries the greenest in the world by setting carbon emissions limits on production, obliging manufacturers to use recycled content, and imposing checks to prevent labour abuses in the battery supply chain.\n\nThe outcome of the inter-institutional wrangling will have a major impact on the electric car industry. All batteries produced for the vehicles will need to adhere to the requirements of the legislation.\n\nEURACTIV understands that France, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council until July, is keen to progress the file as quickly as possible.\n\nSeveral further trialogues are already scheduled, with the aim of having an agreement brokered before the summer break.\n\nTaxi operators turn to hydrogen to cut emissions\n\nMuch of the debate on the future of private road transport has come down to internal combustion engine cars vs electric vehicles.\n\nBut there is another option, which is proving popular among taxi fleet operators \u2013 hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nCities across Europe have seen a boost in the number of hydrogen-powered taxis, thanks in part to favourable legislation.\n\nThe Clean Hydrogen Partnership, a joint venture between the EU and industry, aims to roll out 180 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in Paris, London, and Copenhagen.\n\n\u201cHydrogen is the ideal fuel for taxis because of the long-range, intensive use and short recharging time,\u201d said Clean Hydrogen Partnership CEO Bart Biebuyck.\n\nHydrogen-fuel cell vehicles have a similar range to internal combustion engine cars and can be refuelled in around five minutes.\n\nThe EU is supporting the Clean Hydrogen Partnership with \u20ac1 billion to accelerate the development of clean hydrogen applications.\n\nRead EURACTIV journalist Nelly Moussu\u2019s full report below.\n\nEurope\u2019s market for hydrogen-powered taxis is becoming increasingly competitive, with French company Hype, which has developed them in Paris since 2015, being among the frontrunners.\n\nThe European Union is preparing \u201csmart sanctions\u201d against Russian oil imports, The Times reported on Monday (25 April), citing the European Commission\u2019s executive vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\nThe inclusion of natural gas in the European Commission\u2019s proposal on low-carbon shipping fuels is incompatible with the recommendations of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), writes Faig Abbasov of Transport & Environment.\n\nThe EU\u2019s promotion of biofuels as a renewable energy source is undermining the bloc\u2019s climate goals, a new study by Princeton University academics and CIRAD, a French agricultural research body, has found. Industry has accused the report of ignoring the benefits of energy crops to further an anti-biofuels narrative.\n\nUkraine has received fighter planes and aircraft parts to bolster its air force in the face of Russia\u2019s invasion, the Pentagon said Tuesday (19 April), declining to specify the number of aircraft or their origin.",

He was transferred to Lille in 2008 by Benedict XVI.\n\nAmong the challenges facing the 70-year-old archbishop will be to heal the divisions exposed in the Paris archdiocese during Aupetit\u2019s tenure from 2017 to 2021.\n\nHe will also oversee the restoration of the interior of Notre-Dame Cathedral following a devastating fire in 2019. The cathedral is expected to reopen for worship on April 16, 2024, five years after the blaze.\n\nIn his first message to his new flock, dated April 25, Ulrich said: \u201cIt is a joy for us to wait for the day of its reopening so that we can still proclaim the living Christ there, while obviously not neglecting the many reasons that attract people to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am aware of the complexity of the challenges that will be presented to us in the years to come, and this should not worry us, but it requires our cooperation: a profoundly synodal attitude, \u2018it is precisely this path of synodality which God expects of the Church of the third millennium,\u2019 according to Pope Francis.\u201d\n\nAupetit submitted his resignation to Pope Francis in November 2021 after the magazine Le Point published a report portraying the archbishop as a divisive and authoritarian figure.\n\nThe report also raised concerns about Aupetit\u2019s contacts with a woman dating back to 2012, when he was vicar general of the archdiocese. The archbishop said he was not in a relationship with the woman.\n\nPope Francis accepted Aupetit\u2019s resignation on Dec. 2, 2021, but later expressed doubt about the validity of the criticisms of the archbishop.\n\nDuring an in-flight press conference a few days later, the pope told journalists that he had accepted Aupetit\u2019s resignation \u201con the altar of hypocrisy\u201d because the archbishop had \u201clost his reputation so publicly.\u201d\n\nAupetit announced in February that he would continue to serve as a member of the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Bishops, after receiving encouragement from Pope Francis.\n\nThe Paris archdiocese, which dates back to the 3rd century, serves an estimated 1.3 million Catholics out of a total population of around 2.2 million people.\n\nThe archdiocese said on April 26 that Ulrich will be installed as the 142nd archbishop of Paris at 6:30 p.m. local time on May 23 at the Church of Saint-Sulpice.\n\n(Photo by Mory Hugo via Wikimedia/CNA)",

Real Madrid are a whopping 6/1 at SBK for an Etihad win while the draw pays 39/10 with the same firm.\n\nHead to head\n\nThese teams have faced off six times in Europe and there's nothing between them with two wins apiece and two draws. They last met in the round of 16 two years ago, with Guardiola's side winning 2-1 at the Etihad (below) after beating Real Madrid by the same score in Spain.\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nKevin De Bruyne usually steps up in the big games for Manchester City and it was his goal that saw off Atletico Madrid in the last round. The Belgian playmaker is 40/17 with SBK for anytime scorer but I'm more drawn to an assist at 6/4 with Paddy Power.\n\nIt's hard to look past Benzema for a Real Madrid goal after his heroics against both PSG and Chelsea. The France striker is 47/20 at Unibet for anytime scorer which looks a bit overpriced.\n\nAnything else catch the eye?\n\nOn the evidence of the two games against Chelsea this should be a thriller and I fancy both teams to score at 10/11 with Bet365, given lowly Watford managed to breach City's defence at the weekend.\n\nSkyBet are also offering a boosted 11/2 on each team having two or more shots on target in each half and that could be worth a punt as I'm expecting an open game.\n\nThe card markets are always worth a look in high-stake games and I like the 5/4 on offer at BetVictor on Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro falling foul of the referee.\n\nThis UEFA Champions League match between Manchester City and Real Madrid will be played on Apr 26, 2022 and kick off at 20:00.

        "text": "Vanhanen now says he is not expecting any initiatives on troop movements to come from \u00c5land.\n\nSpeaker of Parliament Matti Vanhanen (Cen) said on Monday that he has not heard serious discussion about a desire to station military troops on the autonomous and demilitarised island region of \u00c5land, a Swedish-speaking maritime province of Finland.\n\nNewspaper Etel\u00e4-Suomen Sanomat (ESS) reported on Sunday that Vanhanen said he hopes \u00c5land will take an initiative to deploy Finnish troops in the province, making the comments at a Centre Party-organised public event in Lahti that day.\n\nESS reported that Vanhanen suggested that a proposal to change \u00c5land's special status could come in June, when it is set to celebrate a century of self-government.\n\nOn Monday he told Yle that he does not expect such an initiative, adding that it was up to the \u00c5land government to decide whether they want to discuss the issue.\n\nVanhanen said that his statements were not accurately reflected.\n\n\"I took part in an event in Lahti yesterday and a member of the public asked a question about troops on \u00c5land. Answering that question, I emphasised that \u00c5land's demilitarised status is based on international agreements. In that context, I stated that it would be easier \u2014 from a defence standpoint \u2014 to have troops stationed on \u00c5land, but that no such proposal is forthcoming. It is up to the people of \u00c5land to decide whether they want to start a process to change that status,\" he said, according to Svenska Yle.\n\nThe Swedish-language public broadcasting news outlet also reported on Monday that \u00c5land MP Mats L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m told \u00c5land Radio that Vanhanen's comments on Sunday were misinterpreted.\n\n\"I spoke with Matti Vanhanen myself after the comment was published and he said it was a misinterpretation,\" L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m said, according to Svenska Yle.\n\nThe MP pointed out that the country's security policy was dominating the political debate in Finland.\n\n\"It's natural, given what is happening in the world and given that Finland is seriously pursuing discussion on changing its foreign policy line by joining Nato. Therefore, everyone gets very excited about statements that are made,\" L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m said, adding that such discussion can get blown out of proportion \"because everyone is waiting and wants to hear them.\"\n\nVanhanen reiterated to Yle that, in practice, having a military base in the province would make it easier to defend it, but that it was up to the people of \u00c5land to decide if they wanted to change their status.\n\nThe province was demilitarised after the Crimean War in 1856. The Treaty of Paris concluded that year stipulates that there can be no military force on the island, however the Finnish Border Guard operates stations there.\n\nWhen asked whether \u00c5land's security situation should be strengthened during this sensitive time in terms of international affairs, Vanhanen said he trusts the Finnish Defence Forces.\n\n\"[Our] agreements make it possible, if the need arises, for Finland to take care of \u00c5land's defence if the need arises. It is the responsibility of the Defence Forces to properly assess required preparedness,\" Vanhanen told Yle.\n\nVanhanen also noted that \u00c5land's special status would not prevent Finland from joining Nato.\n\n\u00c5land's Premier Veronica Th\u00f6rnroos said on Monday that there are no discussions in \u00c5land about changing the status of the islands, but in an interview with Yle she did stress that Finland has the responsibility to defend the province.\n\nTh\u00f6rnroos was visiting Helsinki on Monday, and met Vanhanen as part of her trip. She said Vanhanen made clear that he had no intention of suggesting a change to \u00c5land's demilitarised status.\n\nSign up for our weekly email hereto get a selection of the week's top stories in your inbox every Thursday.",

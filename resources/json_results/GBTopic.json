There are various causes of hepatitis, including viral infections and alcohol consumption,\u201d said Dr Stephanie Ooi, a GP at the MyHealthcare Clinic in London.\n\n\u201cSome cases of hepatitis will resolve with no ongoing issues; however, there are certain cases that can be longer lasting, and cause more serious damage to the liver, and affect liver function.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NHS, hepatitis E \u2013 caused by the hepatitis E virus \u2013 is the most common cause of short-term (acute) hepatitis in the UK.\n\n\u2013 What are the symptoms?\n\nSymptoms may include feeling sick, a high temperature and tiredness (Alamy/PA)\n\nAccording to the NHS, short-term (acute) hepatitis often has no noticeable symptoms, so you may not realise you have it.\n\nIf you do experience symptoms, Dr Ooi said: \u201cYou may notice a high temperature, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), fever, generally feeling unwell, dark-coloured urine and pale-coloured stool. In addition you may have tummy pain, have a reduced appetite and itchy skin.\u201d\n\nThe NHS lists muscle and joint pain and feeling unusually tired all the time as further symptoms.\n\n\u2013 What should parents and carers do?\n\n\u201cThe number of cases of hepatitis in children is increasing, which is understandably causing some concern amongst parents,\u201d said Dr Ooi. \u201cThe best thing to do is to see your GP if you notice any of the above symptoms, and are worried about hepatitis.\n\n\u201cSome of the symptoms can present in other conditions, so it does not necessarily mean your child has hepatitis \u2013 but jaundice in particular needs to be urgently highlighted to a doctor.\u201d\n\nSince the start of the year, 111 children have required hospital treatment for hepatitis (Peter Byrne/PA) (PA Wire)\n\nDr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said: \u201cNormal hygiene measures such as thorough handwashing (including supervising children) and good thorough respiratory hygiene, help to reduce the spread of many common infections, including adenovirus.\n\n\u201cChildren experiencing symptoms of a gastrointestinal infection, including vomiting and diarrhoea, should stay at home and not return to school or nursery until 48 hours after the symptoms have stopped.\u201d\n\n\u2013 What are the treatment options?\n\nDr Ooi said: \u201cThe treatment will depend on what is causing the hepatitis, so this will vary. Your child will be assessed and monitored and have any further tests that need to be done.\n\n\u201cTreatment will also be based on symptoms, i.e. giving adequate pain relief if they are in pain or feeling uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nIn very serious cases, sufferers might need a liver transplant.",

You deserve to have a cheaper, faster service. Boris Johnson\n\n\u201cI am not going to rule anything out. I don\u2019t mind whether it is in the public or the private sector,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat I want is for it to deliver value for money and help people\u2019s costs. If you want to go on holiday with your family it can cost hundreds of pounds to get new passports.\n\n\u201cYou deserve to have a cheaper, faster service.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson was also said to have put the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and other \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d bodies on notice in comments to Cabinet ministers, according to the source who attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\n\nThe Prime Minister is understood to be \u201chorrified\u201d at the backlog in dealing with passport applications and will summon the agency\u2019s leadership for urgent talks at No 10 on Thursday.\n\nHe is said to be concerned that families wanting to go on summer holidays are under pressure to pay up to \u00a3100 extra per passport for fast-track applications because of delays.\n\nThe source cautioned that privatisation would not be the starting point, but warned that Downing Street could look to businesses to take over if passport bosses could not meet the 10-week target for standard applications costing \u00a375.50.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Johnson acknowledged that he had criticised \u201cpost-Covid, work-from-home, manana culture\u201d at some of the bodies for not adapting after the easing of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nAs well as the Passport Office, MPs have been raising concerns over significant delays in turning around applications for licences at the DVLA.\n\n\u201cI think that we have a general issue in some of our approach to public services. We all got used to working from home, Zoom calls,\u201d Mr Johnson said.\n\n\u201cI am the custodian of the public purse I have to ask myself whether it is as productive as all that.\u201d\n\nDowning Street chief of staff Steve Barclay is expected to meet with Passport Office officials later this week.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman would not comment on Cabinet leaks, but told reporters: \u201cThe Prime Minister is adamant this is a serious issue facing families and it\u2019s one that needs to be gripped.\u201d\n\nIn response to the criticism, a spokesperson for HM Passport Office said: \u201cSince April 2021, we have been advising people to allow up to 10 weeks when applying for their British passport as more than five million people delayed applying due to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe urge people who need a new passport to apply for one as soon as possible, with the vast majority of all passport applications being dealt with well within 10 weeks.\n\n\u201cTo deal with this demand, we have increased staff numbers by 500 since April 2021. This has helped us to handle more applications than ever before, with more than one million passport applications processed in March 2022.\u201d\n\nHeathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said it was \u201cvital\u201d that people could go on holiday this summer in case the UK reintroduced coronavirus travel restrictions.\n\nMr Holland-Kaye told the PA news agency: \u201cNormally the Passport Office is very slick in processing passports. It\u2019s really disappointing to hear (about delays).\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not resolved, it is going to mean that people can\u2019t get away.\n\n\u201cAfter two years of lockdown, we need to make sure people can have a good holiday because many of them have vouchers that they\u2019ve been saving up, they\u2019ve got trips of a lifetime that they\u2019ve put on hold, and we don\u2019t know when things might get closed down again.\n\n\u201cMaking the most of the summer is vital.\u201d\n\nThe PCS union condemned the Prime Minister\u2019s suggestion that HM Passport Office could be privatised.\n\nGeneral secretary Mark Serwotka said: \u201cIt is absurd for Boris Johnson to threaten to privatise HMPO, when it is clear that the current problems are mainly down to the casualisation of the workforce.\u201d\n\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that families are having to cancel hard-earned holidays costing thousands of pounds because of chaos and delays at the Passport Office.\n\n\u201cHome Office ministers were warned many months ago that they needed to prepare for an increase in demand after Covid, but they have completely failed to do so and families are paying the price.\u201d",

They are not the issues that students are bringing up to me \u2013 they\u2019re bringing up sexual harassment, they\u2019re bringing up antisemitism,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Donelan said for universities that have not yet signed up to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, it \u201cmakes you question whether they are getting their priorities right\u201d, adding that universities should focus on tackling harassment and antisemitism rather than looking at trigger warnings on content.\n\n\u201cI think their priorities, fundamentally, should be the welfare, the wellbeing and the education of students.\u201d\n\nShe said there is \u201can undeniable link between quality and free speech\u201d, noting that 86% of Nobel Prize winners come from countries with the highest rating for academic freedom while just 1% are from countries with the lowest rating.\n\nMs Donelan said: \u201cVice-chancellors need to ensure that they\u2019re not on the wrong side of history on this. We want them to proactively be supporting their members of staff \u2013 they may face criticism but certainly shouldn\u2019t face harassment when they put forward their views and their academic research.\u201d\n\nWho would you rather employ - an inquisitive, critical, open-minded graduate, or a self-contained cookie-cutter graduate who is afraid to be challenged or confront new ideas? Universities Minister Michelle Donelan\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms Donelan told a meeting at the Policy Exchange think tank in London that supporting free speech is \u201cno longer enough\u201d and it is \u201csomething that has to be actively defended\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhere would we be now if the views of 100 or even 200 years ago had never been challenged? As a woman, I doubt I would be a Member of Parliament, let alone the Minister for Higher and Further Education,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut, sadly, where once we found critical debate and arguments which were run on their merit, today we have seen an upsurge in physical threats and complete intolerance of opposing ideas.\u201d\n\nShe said professors have been \u201charangued and hounded just for doing their jobs\u201d and \u201cprominent, well-respected guests no-platformed\u201d.\n\nAcademics are \u201cself-censoring themselves\u201d in this climate, she added.\n\nMs Donelan said graduates will lose out from this over the long term.\n\n\u201cWho would you rather employ \u2013 an inquisitive, critical, open-minded graduate, or a self-contained cookie-cutter graduate who is afraid to be challenged or confront new ideas?\u201d\n\nMs Donelan said she found it \u201ccompletely deplorable\u201d that, last year, \u201cbalaclava-clad protesters forced a female academic, Kathleen Stock, to stay off campus under threats of physical violence\u201d, referring to the professor who quit the University of Sussex due to her views on gender identity.\n\nThis was not an \u201cisolated event\u201d, the minister added, as just a few weeks later an \u201cintolerant mob\u201d threatened the Israeli ambassador outside an event held at the London School of Economics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about peaceful protest here, the right of which of course is sacrosanct. We are talking about threats, intimidation and harassment.\u201d\n\nMs Donelan said Policy Exchange polling had shown that 32% of academics identifying as right-wing had refrained from airing their views in teaching or research, while around 15% identifying as politically centrist or left-wing also reported self-censoring.\n\nVice-chancellors, academics and students should not \u201callow the history books to record your name as part of the small cabal of the intolerant\u201d, she said.\n\nVCs need to \u201cgo into bat\u201d for their staff and \u201cput their money where their mouth is\u201d on the issue rather than bowing to the \u201cintolerant few\u201d.\n\nThe Government\u2019s Free Speech Bill has been carried over to the next session of Parliament.\n\nMs Donelan said she expects the House of Lords will have \u201ca lot to say on this subject\u201d but that the Bill is less about what happens in Parliament than \u201ca culture change that will reverberate through the sector\u201d.",

(Christopher Furlong /pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nUK\u2019s Johnson Hails Macron Victory, Stresses Common Stance on Ukraine\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his reelection and said he looks forward to working with the French president on issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nFinal results of the runoff election on April 24 showed Macron beat his right-wing opponent Marine Le Pen with 58.54 percent of the vote, a higher margin of victory than many earlier surveys had predicted but well below the 66.1 percent he scored against the same opponent in their first runoff in 2017.\n\nJohnson said on Twitter: \u201cCongratulations to Emmanuel Macron on your re-election as president of France. France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n\u201cI look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.\u201d\n\nTalking to reporters on April 25, Johnson said it is \u201cvery important\u201d to have a French president \u201cwho can be relied upon\u201d on international issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right for friendly governments to comment on elections in neighbouring countries but what I can certainly say is that it is very, very important that Emmanuel and I have been able to work closely together on Ukraine over the last few weeks and months,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of NATO, has been absolutely vital for the stance we\u2019ve taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I\u2019m very, very reassured by that.\u201d\n\nFrench President and La Republique en Marche party candidate for reelection Emmanuel Macron celebrates after his victory in France\u2019s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars in Paris, on April 24, 2022. (Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nLondon and Paris have endured a tense relationship in recent years. The French government has complained about the UK\u2019s reluctance to issue fishing licences to French fishermen, claiming it was a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly expressed frustration over France\u2019s alleged failure to prevent illegal immigrants from boarding small boats and crossing the English Channel into Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson, who led the Brexit campaign and took the UK out of the EU, has more common ground with Le Pen than Macron on the issue of EU membership.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, though she insisted during the election campaign she had no \u201csecret agenda\u201d this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nMarine Le Pen, presidential candidate, delivers her concession speech after early result projections show France\u2019s incumbent President Emmanuel Macron heading to win a second five-year term as president, in Paris, on April 24, 2022. (Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images)\n\nDespite the fractious post-Brexit relations between the UK and French governments, the war in Ukraine has recently refocused minds on the issue of European security.\n\nBritain has positioned itself as one of Kyiv\u2019s closest allies both in the run-up to and during the Russian invasion, and has called on other European powers, including France, to do more.\n\nCabinet minister and Conservative Party Chairman Oliver Dowden told Sky News on Sunday, \u201cI think we\u2019ve had very positive noises from France and Germany but I would like to see further action from them.\u201d\n\nThough the UK government is still unsatisfied with Macron\u2019s level of support for Ukraine, his rival Le Pen could not necessarily be counted on to make the same \u201cpositive noises.\u201d\n\nDuring the election campaign, Le Pen defended her previous expressions of esteem for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying she had only been defending French interests in her warm contacts with the Kremlin leader.\n\nShe insisted on maintaining good relations with Putin, saying, \u201cAs soon as the Russian\u2013Ukrainian war is over and has been settled by a peace treaty, I will call for the implementation of a strategic rapprochement between NATO and Russia.\u201d\n\nShe also said, if elected president, she would take France out of NATO\u2019s integrated command structure to restore French sovereignty on matters of international security.\n\nPA Media and Reuters contributed to this report.",

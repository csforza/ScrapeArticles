        "text": "China\u2019s strategy in the Solomons\n\nBy Shih Ya-hsuan \u65bd\u96c5\u8ed2\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday last week, China confirmed it had sealed a security pact with the Solomon Islands.\n\n\u201cChina and Solomon Islands have officially signed a framework agreement on bilateral security cooperation,\u201d Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin (\u6c6a\u6587\u5f6c) told a news conference.\n\nBased on a leaked document on social media, the Solomon Islands \u201cmay request China to send police, armed police, military personnel and other law enforcement and armed forces,\u201d and that Beijing could send ships for stopovers and to replenish supplies.\n\nAs the pact could give China a military foothold in the South Pacific, countries in the Pacific region have voiced concerns.\n\nOn Wednesday last week, the People\u2019s Liberation Army Daily ran an article titled \u201cTroops need to prepare for war,\u201d in which it said: \u201cMen need to prepare ... in terms of capability and even mindset.\u201d\n\nIf China wishes to transform from a green-water navy to a blue-water navy \u2014 meaning a maritime force capable of operating globally \u2014 then it needs a destination for it to send troops, and a legitimate reason to do so.\n\nLocated 5,000km from China\u2019s Fujian Province, the Solomon Islands is in the southern hemisphere. As the seasons there are the opposite of those in the northern hemisphere, the Solomon Islands could not be a more ideal naval base for distance training.\n\nWhether it is the Shandong or Liaoning aircraft carrier, they would no longer need to loiter in the Taiwan Strait, but could sail through the Bashi Channel or the Miyako Strait and head out into the Pacific Ocean. This move to boost the scale and strength of its military drills proves that China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army has adjusted its direction and resolve.\n\nWith the Russian Ministry of Defense having said that its Moskva guided-missile cruiser, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, sank on April 14, there is no end in sight to the war in Ukraine.\n\nAs it focuses on staying above the fray, China\u2019s ploy with the Solomon Islands is about bolstering its defense plans in the South Pacific. It is also a harbinger of Beijing\u2019s grand strategy and long game: The formation of a military alliance to take on the democracies of the West.\n\nAs an important stakeholder in the emerging dynamics of the Pacific region, Taiwan needs to be on its guard and make its next move carefully.\n\nShih Ya-hsuan is an associate professor at National Kaohsiung Normal University\u2019s Department of Geography.\n\nTranslated by Rita Wang",

The issue stirred anger on both sides and threatened to damage trade between the two countries and undermine security cooperation.\n\nThe seven-member delegation arrived in Japan on April 24 for a five-day visit amid speculation that Kishida might attend Yoon\u2019s inauguration ceremony.\n\nThe last time a Japanese prime minister attended a South Korean presidential inauguration was in 2008.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.",

Photo: Heo Ran, Reuters\n\nInflation topped 4 percent last month for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nThe central bank said it expects prices to stay above its target of 2 percent this year, while estimating that the economy would grow less than previously forecast.\n\nEconomists expect the Bank of Korea to raise interest rates further amid rising inflation, having already hiked twice this year.\n\n\u201cPolicy normalization is likely to stay on track,\u201d said Yoon Yeo-sam, an analyst at Meritz Securities Co in Seoul. \u201cThe worry is the second half with inflation spilling into wages and putting pressure on businesses. The [COVID-19] lockdowns in China and Europe\u2019s geopolitical risks are additional concerns.\u201d\n\nEconomists had expected consumption would take a hit in the first quarter due to virus cases among South Korea\u2019s 50 million people reaching all-time highs.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in\u2019s administration responded with its first extra budget of the year to minimize the economic hit, while reworking the quarantine strategy around the concept of living with the virus rather than toughening restrictions.\n\nThe policies might be paying off.\n\nBank of Korea board member Joo Sang-yong said earlier this month that consumption appeared to be picking up from the middle of last month.\n\nMeanwhile, the rise in virus cases has slowed in the past few weeks.\n\nThe momentum appears set to last into this quarter, with social distancing eased and exports holding up, Yoon said.\n\nStill, higher commodity prices are set to weigh on demand at home and abroad, while a slowdown in China\u2019s economy might crimp orders for South Korea\u2019s exports.\n\nThe GDP data showed that investment in facilities and construction led the deceleration in economic growth, with the former declining by 4 percent.\n\nAbout two-thirds of construction materials recorded price increases of more than 10 percent from the prior year in early this year, according to a central bank study published last month.\n\nOverall prices increased 28.5 percent in the fourth quarter last year, underscoring the impact of higher commodity costs.\n\nThe GDP report also showed private consumption fell 0.5 percent, while government spending was unchanged.\n\nOverseas shipments were also resilient, increasing 4.1 percent.

Its military spending was 1.4 per cent lower compared than 2020\u2019s due to inflation.\n\nJapan: Japan\u2019s spend increased to $54.1 billion in 2021 after the government added $7 billion to military spending. This led to an increase in spending of 7.3 per cent, the highest since 1972.\n\nAustralia: The country increased its military spending by 4 per cent to reach $31.8 billion.\n\nIran: Iran\u2019s military budget increased for the first time in four years to $24.6 billion. Funding for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps grew 14 per cent as compared to 2020 and amounted to 34 per cent of the country\u2019s total military expenditure.\n\nQatar: The country was the fifth largest spender in the Middle East with military spend of $11.6 billion, an increase of 434 per cent from 2010, which is when it last released its military spending data.\n\nUkraine: The country\u2019s military spending rose 72 per cent as it sharpened its defences against Russia following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. While it fell in 2021, Ukraine\u2019s spend of $5.9 billion accounted for 3.2 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nNigeria: On the back of numerous security challenges, Nigeria increased its military spending by 56 per cent in 2021 to reach $4.5 billion.\n\nAlso read: Rajnath Singh urges US firms to carry out R&D, manufacturing of defence equipment\n\nAlso read: Rajnath hands over DRDO's Counter Drone System docs to firms including Adani Defence, L&T",

        "text": "Author: Rahul Nath Choudhury, ICWA\n\nIn 2022, India has renewed its interest in free trade agreements (FTAs) with several economies, including the United Kingdom and Australia. India and Australia had already signed an interim FTA last week and expected to enter into a full FTA by end of this year. India\u2019s approach to resuming negotiations has a sense of urgency and a few rounds of discussion have already taken place. The United Kingdom has traditionally been a large trading partner for India while Australia is emerging as a promising destination.\n\nThis is a dramatic shift from India\u2019s earlier approach to FTAs. After assuming power in 2014, the Modi government started reviewing India\u2019s existing trade pacts. There was a widespread belief in the government that FTAs created significant economic losses by allowing subsidised foreign products and other unfair production advantages for foreign firms.\n\nAustralian trade matters to India because of its growing energy demands. India aspires to become a leader in energy-consuming industries such as information technology and electric vehicles. An FTA with Australia would allow India to meet its energy needs and export skilled professionals in IT, engineering and other services.\n\nAustralia also holds a crucial strategic position for India. An Australian FTA would offer the largest market to Indian businesses in the Pacific region. Initiatives such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative have brought the two countries closer than before. An FTA is an opportunity to further strengthen bilateral relations.\n\nIn the UK\u2013India FTA, India wants to secure larger market access for its agricultural produce and increase exports in services such as IT, nursing, education and health care. India seeks reduced tariffs in labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather and jewellery, which have always found a large market in the United Kingdom. India also wants to secure a larger number of employment visas for its professionals in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe difference between the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the current negotiations lies in their foundations. Since RCEP is a plurilateral agreement, India had to negotiate with many diverse countries and held much less negotiating power compared to bilateral pacts.\n\nIndia already has a trade arrangement with ASEAN, which makes up most of RCEP\u2019s participants, but its experience has not been very encouraging. China\u2019s membership in RCEP was another concern since India fears Chinese businesses will destroy its domestic industry.\n\nWhat prompted India\u2019s appetite for new trade agreements? India\u2019s trade deficit reveals a widening gap between export and import figures as it grew from US$118.37 billion in 2014\u201315 to US$161.34 billion in 2019\u201320. India aims to become a US$5 trillion economy by 2025 and it cannot achieve this without strong support from the external sector. India aims to boost exports through FTAs to large markets that are performing below their potential, such as Australia.\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic shook the global economy as lockdowns shattered manufacturing plants and global supply chains. Companies started to weigh options to relocate their manufacturing facilities and economies realised the importance of integration. India was no exception.\n\nIndia\u2019s FTA negotiations are also encouraged by the aim to reduce economic dependence on China. Australia is currently experiencing a trade dispute with China, which has restricted a number of Australian imports and threatened to expand the list. Similarly, the United Kingdom has felt the pinch of Brexit and also needs to diversify its export destinations.\n\nIndia\u2019s renewed interest in FTAs should also be seen from a strategic perspective. India resumed negotiations with economies with which it has robust trade relations or a trade surplus. India\u2019s strategic and diplomatic relations with these nations have significantly deepened during the last few years, especially as they all perceive China as a threat to global trade and domestic industry.\n\nGeopolitics as well as economics will play a vital role in defining India\u2019s future trade partnerships. India and Australia are both part of the QUAD and conduct joint naval exercises in the Indian Ocean region. Australia is among select countries with which India has a 2+2 dialogue. Similarly, India is a key partner of the UK in defence and security and undertakes joint operation in many regions.\n\nLearning from past FTA experiences, India wants a much more comprehensive agreement with carefully negotiated terms that secure maximum benefits.\n\nThe Bharatiya Kisan Union, the largest association of Indian farmers, has already threatened to launch a protest against the proposed FTA with Australia. Such protests were one of the major domestic obstacles that prevented India from entering RCEP. Indian automobile manufacturers and wine sellers also plan to vehemently oppose the FTAs with Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nSwadeshi Jagran Manch, the economic wing of the Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has similar intentions. The RSS previously cautioned the government against the negative impact of FTAs and urged it to refrain from any trade deal. An FTA with Australia will face protests from the agricultural sector while the manufacturing sector will lead protests against the UK\u2013India FTA.\n\nThe current domestic and global economic situation puts India in a favourable position to sign FTAs. Given that India\u2019s appetite for trade liberalisation is supported by domestic industries and a strong government in power, policymakers are in a hurry to close the deal.\n\nRahul Nath Choudhury is a Research Fellow at the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA), New Delhi.

        "text": "Palm oil incident adds uncertainty over Korea\u2019s GDP\n\nCooking oil products are displayed at a large discount chain in Seoul on Monday. (Yonhap)\n\nSEJONG -- A possible glitch in imports of palm oil is expected to further fan inflationary pressure in South Korea and constrain household consumption, which could hamper the growth of the gross domestic product.\n\n\n\nPalm oil is used for producing Korean instant noodles and snacks.\n\n\n\nIts largest producer Indonesia said it would issue a ban on exports of palm oil later this week. The Indonesian government made it clear that the decision was aimed at maintaining a stable domestic supply.\n\n\n\nAs products from Indonesia have accounted for more than half of Korea\u2019s collective palm oil imports, there is a possibility that local prices of ramen, snacks, cosmetics and some others will eventually spiral despite the reserves held by industries, according to market insiders and the Korea Customs Service.\n\n\n\nThe situation could be another negative factor for the nation\u2019s overall economy. More and more international organizations and research institutes have recently predicted that Korea\u2019s GDP growth would stay in a 2 percent range this year in the wake of a spike in global raw materials prices from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nStatistics Korea data showed that the nation\u2019s consumer prices climbed 3.6 percent in January on-year, 3.7 percent in February and 4.1 percent in March.\n\n\n\nGiven that consumer price growth on a yearly basis stayed at 0.4 percent in 2019, 0.5 percent in 2020 and 2.5 percent in 2021, monthly figures for 2022 have become a downside risk for the economy.\n\n\n\nAlongside high consumer prices, the spike in raw materials prices is posing a heavy cost burden for local exporters of processed products, which is another negative factor for GDP.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Korea Customs Service, import prices of palm oil had already rapidly increased due to a surge in global demand amid normalization of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nIn March, the nation imported palm oil worth $90.38 million, under which the unit price per metric ton reached an all-time high of $1,453. This marked a 40.6 percent increase from March 2021, and a 95.1 percent increase compared to March 2020.\n\n\n\nThe sharp growth in palm oil prices was in line with steady growth in the prices of grain products such as wheat, corn and soybean oil, market insiders said.\n\n\n\nBy the news of Indonesia\u2019s scheduled export ban, trading prices of palm oil at the Kuala Lumpur Exchange shot up to 6,799 ringgits ($1,560) per ton on Monday, up 7 percent from a session earlier. Malaysia is another large exporter of palm oil.\n\n\n\nAs of March, Indonesia accounted for 56.7 percent of Korea\u2019s palm oil imports, with Malaysia at 43.2 percent.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs alternatives, prices of soybean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil could feasibly climb. The situation could deal a severe blow to producers of ramen and snacks,\u201d a food industry insider told The Korea Herald.\n\n\n\nHe said the issue is how long Indonesia\u2019s export ban will continue, noting that local food companies are holding palm oil reserves sufficient for three or four months.\n\n\n\nBy Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)",

        "text": "China\u2019s second quarter economic growth is expected to be slower than the first quarter as a growing number of Chinese cities and districts are locked down amid Covid-19 outbreaks, now including areas of the capital Beijing.\n\nPeople in the Chaoyang district, a central business district in Beijing, were ordered on Monday (April 25) to avoid going out as dozens of people infected with Covid-19 have been discovered in recent days.\n\nDistricts that are home to 16.4 million people are still under lockdown in Shanghai, a city of 28 million. China\u2019s largest commercial center recorded 19,455 infections on Sunday, compared with 21,058 cases on Saturday. More than 200 new cases were identified outside quarantined facilities each day.\n\nShanghai announced on Monday that 51 people, with an average age of 84, died from Covid on Sunday, up from 39 deaths on Saturday.\n\nWith Shanghai and many other Chinese cities locked down, it will be difficult for China to achieve its full-year GDP target of 5.5% for 2022, economists said. The policy support unveiled by the central government and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) should help to cushion the impact, but is unlikely to give the economy a sustainable boost, they said.\n\nShanghai has been locked down since March 28 after thousands of Covid-19 cases, mostly asymptomatic, were reported. On April 19, the Shanghai government decided to relax lockdown measures in three districts to grant 4 million people more freedom of mobility.\n\nAt present, 11.9 million people in 16,650 closed-off management areas cannot leave their homes or workplaces in Shanghai, while 4.5 million people in 13,304 restrictive control areas are not allowed to leave their areas. The remaining 7.9 million people in 28,075 prevention areas can walk on the streets but they must avoid public gatherings.\n\nA healthcare worker wears full protection gear in Shanghai on March 13, 2022. Photo: Xinhua\n\nWith widespread reports of food shortages, price gouging and mismanaged quarantine centers in Shanghai, Beijing residents have rushed to panic-buy groceries after the capital city\u2019s government announced 14 closed-off management areas and 14 restrictive control areas in Chaoyang district on Sunday.\n\nThe government said everyone in the district must have a PCR test on a daily basis from Monday before they travel to work. All sports and cultural activities in Chaoyang were canceled from Saturday.\n\nYang Peipei, deputy chief of the Chaoyang district government, said some companies in the service sector would be ordered to shut down temporarily. Yang said each of the employees in these affected companies would be compensated 100 yuan (US$15.2) per day for up to 21 days, while each affected company could claim up to 100,000 yuan from an insurance scheme jointly launched by the government and the People\u2019s Insurance Company of China.\n\nYang said residents in Beijing should not be overly concerned about food supplies as key supermarkets had boosted their inventories, while the government had already set up a reserve. She said people who spread rumors and raised food prices would be punished.\n\nHowever, some media reported that vegetables were already sold out in supermarkets in Chaoyang district, as well as in nearby Tongzhou district. People also failed to find fresh food on e-commerce platforms, the reports said.\n\nOn Saturday, Zhengzhou in Henan province announced a lockdown of the entire city for seven days to launch a mandatory testing scheme. Taiwan\u2019s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd said the Zhengzhou-based factory of its unit Foxconn, which assembles iPhones for Apple Inc, would maintain normal production despite the Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone\u2019s lockdown.\n\nThe local government in Yantai in eastern China\u2019s Shandong province said Monday it recorded 36 Covid cases on Sunday. It said it had identified the BA.2.3 Omicron variant, which is highly infectious, after an analysis of 16 Covid samples in the city. Local officials said the coronavirus could have been spread by asymptomatic patients in the city for some time.\n\nHow many Chinese people are now under lockdown, and the impact the lack of mobility will have on the economy, is a matter of analytical debate.\n\nAbout 373 million people in 45 Chinese cities were under some kind of lockdown, the Japanese bank Nomura said in a research report on April 15. At least 30 million people in 22 Chinese cities were still being locked down, Caixin.com reported on April 18, citing a different definition of lockdowns.\n\nNobody knows how long the lockdown in Shanghai will last. Photo: WikiCommons\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s GDP for the first quarter of this year came in much stronger than expected while activity slowed in March, reflecting the initial impact of the Covid-19-related restrictions,\u201d Sophie Altermatt, an economist at Julius Baer, said in a research note. \u201cThe negative impact on economic activity will likely be more notable in April.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the major outbreaks can be contained and local restrictions eased in the next few weeks, activity might gradually normalize in May,\u201d Altermatt wrote, adding that Julius Baer has downgraded its second-quarter GDP growth forecast to 4.1% year-on-year, but maintained its full-year growth target at 4.7%.\n\nShe said it was unlikely that the policy support recently unveiled by the central government and the PBoC could give a significant boost to the Chinese economy, while more risks would emerge if the Covid-19 outbreaks and restrictions lingered longer.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent geopolitical uncertainty and the Omicron outbreak which has triggered strict mobility restrictions, China\u2019s GDP growth in the first quarter of 2022 reached 4.8% year-on-year,\u201d said Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis.\n\n\u201cHowever, this growth rate masked a very large difference between the positive first two months and March.\u201d\n\nGarc\u00eda-Herrero said the most significant impact of the recent Covid shock was on consumption. She said retail sales collapsed in March with a 3.5% year-on-year decline, compared with 6.7% growth in the first two months of 2022.\n\nShe also said China\u2019s investment decelerated in March from the first two months of this year, while exports also slowed.\n\n\u201cWhen focusing on the tougher environment for March and the lack of a very large stimulus so far, we find it not easy for the Chinese economy to achieve the 5.5% growth target announced during the two sessions in Beijing,\u201d Garc\u00eda-Herrero said.\n\nLocal authorities deliver rapid test kits to a resident in Shanghai on April 3, 2022. Photo: Xinhua\n\n\u201cThe duration of the current Omicron wave will be key to estimate how much the Covid shock will impact the economy in 2022.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Shanghai Composite Index, the benchmark of the A-share markets in Shanghai, fell 5.1% to close at 2,928, below the psychologically important 3,000 level, on Monday.\n\nThe CSI 300 Index, which tracks 300 stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, also closed down 4.9% to 3,814, the lowest level in two years.\n\nAnalysts said the markets dropped after the PBoC on Monday allowed the onshore yuan to depreciate to its weakest level in 17 months on concerns about rising capital outflows from China. They said investors were also worried by the prolonged lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing\u2019s Chaoyang district.\n\nRead: Big Tech tagged for Shanghai lockdown food price gouging\n\nFollow Jeff Pao on Twitter: @jeffpao3",

        "text": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory has come not because he is a popular politician able to bridge both sides of the divide, but despite a weary population grappling with mounting inflation, rising unemployment and massive immigration. All issues that Marine Le Pen succeeded in bringing to the forefront of the bruising presidential campaign.\n\nMoreover, the hard-Left candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, who lost in the first round two weeks ago, refused to ask the 7.7 million people who voted for him to back Macron.\n\nMeaning, Macron\u2019s victory doesn\u2019t mean France necessarily wanted him to be President, but that they wanted Marine Le Pen even less.\n\nSo, what does India think about an election playing out 8,553 km away? In the good-old days, when the Indian passport wasn\u2019t encased in steel, you could drive from Delhi to Paris via Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Slovenia, Austria and Belgium. Today, a Schengen visa, via France, comes with several tough conditionalities, mostly aimed at plugging loopholes that intrepid illegal migrants may make use of to jump ship.\n\nThis fear, that illegals from developing nations may overwhelm majority Catholic France, has become the new normal. Marine Le Pen has brought these concerns centre-stage and Macron hasn\u2019t been able to allay them.\n\nStill, the answer to who rules France is important not just for France, or the European Union, in which it is embedded, or the UN Security Council of which it is a permanent member \u2013 but also for India.\n\nAlso read: Emmanuel Macron\u2019s win is an opportunity for France and the EU\n\nAn Indo-Pacific power\n\nWhy a reader of ThePrint should care who sits in the Elys\u00e9e is simple: France has occasionally inculcated the odd habit of doing something really different and almost getting away with it. Like the ideas of liberty, egalitarianism and fraternity the French Revolution espoused 223 years ago, which the Indian Constitution embraced with such fervour in 1950. (Of course, France temporarily forgot those ideals when it pursued the colonisation of Algeria some decades ago with exemplary vigour and passion; to its credit, it has tried to wear the warts from those shameful decades on its sleeve.)\n\nNot that France has fully relinquished her colonies. There are still a few littered across the globe \u2013 from Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the northern coast of Canada to islands in the Caribbean to French Guiana in South America to territories in the South Pacific, like New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia, which together account for one-third of the Pacific Islands\u2019 combined exclusive economic zone.\n\nThis, along with tiny territories like Reunion, Mayotte, Tromelin and Iles Eparses in the South Indian Ocean allow France the grandiose self-perception of being called an \u201cIndo-Pacific power.\u201d\n\nStill, back in 1998 when India went nuclear, France was the only major power not to have scolded Delhi. The US imposed tough sanctions, as did the UK; even Russia, India\u2019s old friend, was quite irritated it had not been told in advance about India\u2019s intentions. But France understood.\n\nFrance is also the only other country, besides Britain, to have been invited as chief guest to India\u2019s Republic Day celebrations, as many as five times (1976, 1980, 1998, 2008 and 2016). Soon after India got a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers\u2019 Group in 2008 to conduct nuclear trade, France became the only other country, besides Russia, to sign an agreement to sell nuclear reactors to India. The French have sold Scorpene submarines and Mirage fighter jets and more recently, Rafale jets \u2013 no doubt, the defence deals have sweetened the way for a better diplomatic relationship.\n\nLeaders from both sides have used the highest praise for the other. During his visit to Delhi in January 2016, then-president Francois Hollande said he was determined to \u201cconsolidate the strategic partnership\u201d with India; Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded by saying, \u201cIndia and France are made for each other.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Modi\u2019s India is in a foreign policy sweet spot by playing all sides \u2014 US, China, EU, Russia\n\nIndia\u2019s \u2018new Russia\u2019\n\nBy 2019, when Modi returned as PM for the second time, the relationship was in even greater form.\n\nDuring his trip to Paris in August 2019, weeks after the government revoked Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and put half the political class in the former state under house arrest, President Macron made no comment about the violation of human rights in the state.\n\nIn fact, at the UNSC closed-door meeting called by China in the wake of the 5 August abrogation\u2014spurred on by Pakistan\u2014France supported India\u2019s stand on Kashmir.\n\nEarlier, too, the French had backed the UNSC resolution sanctioning Pakistani terrorist Masood Azhar (one of three terrorists released in exchange for the passengers of IC-814 in Kandahar in 1999) as well as stronger FATF sanctions against Pakistan.\n\nSoon enough, many in Delhi and Paris began to call France \u201cIndia\u2019s new Russia.\u201d\n\nCertainly, Macron has been an interesting president these past five years, not least because he has spent several hours conducting shuttle diplomacy with Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine\u2013 but at the presidential debate, accused Le Pen of being a Putin spokesman because she allegedly took a loan for her 2017 campaign via a Russian bank.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine in its second month \u2013 although US politicians Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin were in Kyiv over this weekend \u2013 the newly elected Macron is expected to put himself at the forefront of a united European Union front against Moscow. Certainly, the coming weeks will be interesting not just for the new French president, but for the rest of the international community too.\n\nJyoti Malhotra is a senior consulting editor at ThePrint.

General Assembly took a first step to put the five permanent members of the Security Council under a global spotlight Tuesday when they use their veto power, a move highlighted by Russia\u2019s veto and threat of future vetoes that has paralyzed any action by the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body on the Ukraine war.\n\nThe resolution, which was adopted by consensus by the 193-member assembly with the bang of its president\u2019s gavel and a burst of applause, does not eliminate or limit the veto power of the permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.\n\nBut for the first time it will require the General Assembly \u201cto hold a debate on the situation\u201d that sparks a veto in the Security Council within 10 working days, and to give precedence on the list of speakers to the permanent member who cast the veto.\n\nThe assembly isn\u2019t required to take or consider any action, but the discussion could put veto-wielders on the spot and let a raft of other countries be heard.\n\nLiechtenstein\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Christian Wenaweser, who spearheaded the resolution, has said it aims \u201cto promote the voice of all of us who are not veto-holders, and who are not on the Security Council, on matters of international peace and security because they affect all of us.\u201d\n\nPresenting the resolution to the assembly on Tuesday morning, Wenaweser alluded to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and the Security Council\u2019s failure to take action saying: \u201cThere has never been a stronger need for effective multilateralism than today, and there has never been a stronger need for innovation in order to secure the central role and voice of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nThe resolution had about 80 co-sponsors including the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe reform of the Security Council, which is charged under the U.N. Charter with ensuring international peace and security, has been discussed and debated for more than 40 years, and was front and center in comments by countries before and after the resolution\u2019s adoption on Tuesday.\n\nThere is widespread support for revamping the U.N.\u2019s most powerful organ to reflect current global realities rather than the international power structure after World War II in 1945 when the United Nations was created. But all previous attempts, starting in 1979, have failed because rivalries between countries and regions have blocked agreement on the size, composition and powers of an expanded council.\n\nThe veto power of the five permanent members is one component on the reform agenda.\n\nBy now, more than 200 different Security Council proposals have been vetoed, some by multiple countries, according to U.N. records. The subjects have ranged from the Korean War and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to climate change, reporting on weapons stockpiles, and governance of a part of the Indian Ocean nation Comoros.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and its successor Russia have cast the most vetoes by far, followed by the United States. Far fewer have been cast by Britain, China and France.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The increase was an extremely modest two yen \u2013 a mere \u20ac0.015 ($0.016) \u2013 but the symbolism was far more powerful. Yaokin, which has been making the crunchy corn-based snack since 1979 and had never before raised the price, announced in January that prices would have to go up in April due to a combination of rising costs associated with corn imported from the US and soaring fuel costs.\n\nConsumers were shocked to see Umaibo \u2013 which translates as \"delicious stick\" \u2013 climb by a massive 20 per cent to 12 yen (\u20ac0.087). It turned out to be just the first of many in a nation that previously considered itself effectively immune from inflation. But a prolonged COVID crisis and the war in Ukraine have severely damaged the current economic oulook in the country.\n\nBombshell price hikes\n\nNot long after Yaokin's bombshell announcement, Japan's three largest milk producers stated that they would have to raise cheese prices, and The Nisshin OilliO Group and J-Oil Mills Inc. said the cost of cooking oil would rise in April. Confectionery firm Fujiya Co has hiked the price of its entire range of chocolate products by as much as 10 per cent, citing rising costs for logistics and ingredients.\n\nIt's a similar story in other sectors of the economy, with Nippon Paper Crecia lifting the price of tissue and toilet paper, Kao Corp asking more for some of its diaper products and Bridgestone Corp charging more for its tires. The cost of travelling is also rising, with East Japan Railway Co. increasing the price of bullet train tickets and both domestic carriers, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, lifting prices for many domestic flights from mid-April. And while many of the price increases are relatively small, they have still sent shock waves through a population that cannot comprehend price volatility in everyday staples.\n\nJapanese consumers are worried because the nation has not experienced meaningful inflation since the oil shocks of the 1970s saw energy prices soar by 20 per cent in the space of a year. Those old enough to remember their parents discussing the alarming concept of stagflation are looking with concern at savings, while younger people are looking into their wallets. \"I work at a delicatessen that has a lot of imported foods, and prices have clearly gone up in a short space of time,\" said Yae Oono from Kawasaki city, south of Tokyo. \"It looks like all prices are increasing, but I noticed it most on chilled products, like yogurts.\"\n\nOono said she has also noticed the increase in her own weekly visits to the supermarket. \"I don't think rice has changed so much yet, but bread and cheese are more expensive than before and we are not eating out as much as we used to,\" she told DW. \"Also, I am trying to use my bicycle or the bus more than my car now as the price of gasoline is definitely higher than a few months ago. It's worrying. I wonder how long it will last,\" she added. The outlook is not positive, say experts, particularly as the conflict in Ukraine continues, and supply chains come under renewed pressure while the global economy contracts.\n\nBank of Japan's bad news\n\nIn mid-April, the Bank of Japan announced that the domestic corporate goods price index had reached its highest point since 1982, with the central bank attributing the 9.5 per cent year-on-year increase to surging prices for crude oil and grain triggered by the nascent recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. That increase was exacerbated by the Ukraine conflict and the sudden sharp fall in the value of the yen serving to lift the price of imports.\n\nAmong the most severely affected sectors were imports of energy, with oil and coal prices up by more than 27 per cent. And the problem of rising prices is exacerbated by another factor, said Martin Schulz, chief policy economist for Fujitsu's Global Market Intelligence Unit. \"Inflation is worrisome, but some of the focus is now being turned back on stagnating real incomes,\" he told DW. \"As long as there was price stability in Japan \u2013 or even the deflation that we have seen for many years here \u2013 people did not worry too much. But now we have the double bomb of inflation and incomes stuck at the level they were at 20 years ago and people can only see the downside. Questions are being asked of the Bank of Japan's policies, but it is sticking to its line of expansionary policies with interest rates close to zero, just 0.25 per cent,\" Schulz pointed out.\n\nInvestors out of Japan\n\nThe result is that investors are getting their money out of Japan, the central bank is producing more money to feed into the economy, and the yen is weakening against other global currencies. \"The Bank of Japan is doing exactly the opposite of what is needed to stabilize the yen,\" said Schulz. \"The bank has an important two-day meeting from April 28, at which they will discuss their next policy moves. But they have already indicated that they plan to stick with their current policies.\"\n\nThe bank has for many years set an inflation target of two per cent, but that figure is likely to be surpassed in the coming months, Schulz said, although it will be \"transitory\" and will eventually drop back again. For a nation not used to such price increases or wages that aren't rising in line with the changes, the coming months are likely to cause concern and, for some, more debt or household bankruptcy.",

It is a tragedy that the state government is not able to take action against such people. The government does not belong to the RSS or the VHP.\u201d He added that the \u201cgovernment\u2019s inaction will send wrong signals to the people.\u201d\n\nVishwanath had earlier criticised right-wing organisations against for their calls to bar Muslim traders from participating in temple festivals. He had opposed the demand by groups including the VHP, Hindu Jagarana Vedike, Bajrang Dal and the Sree Rama Sene.\n\nThe BJP government has justified the curbs citing a rule introduced in 2002, during the Congress tenure, that bars non-Hindus from running shops on temple premises.\n\n\u201cThis is all madness. No God or religion preaches these kinds of things. Religions are inclusive and not exclusive. The state government must intervene. I don\u2019t know why the government is mum over this issue,\u201d Vishwanath had said, adding that the move was \u201cundemocratic\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow many Indians are there in England? How many Indians are there around the world? How many Indians are working in Muslim countries? If these countries decide to act against us, where will all this end\u2026 Muslims in India chose to live in India when the Partition of India and Pakistan occurred. They did not go with Jinnah. We must ponder on this, they remained here to be Indians. They are Indians, not people of some other nationality,\u201d he had said.\n\nVishwanath is a former Congress minister and ex-state president of JD(S). The veteran OBC leader switched to the BJP in 2019 to help the party and its leader B S Yediyurappa come to power in Karnataka. He was denied a Cabinet berth after failing to get elected to the state legislature but was nominated to the legislative council.\n\nThe MLC is also a novelist who writes in Kannada. He left the Congress after falling out with fellow OBC leader and former chief minister Siddaramaiah when the party was in power from 2013 to 2018.",

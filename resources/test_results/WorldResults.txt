It is believed that if you are suddenly confronted with a request and are unable to meet it, you and the other party could both be shamed. As U.S. anthropologist Ruth Benedict explained in her 1946 book “The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,” there is a “culture of shame” in Japan.\n\nIn actuality, Zelenskyy’s speech did not contain any requests that would be difficult for the Japanese government to implement. Kishida immediately followed Zelenskyy’s speech with an announcement of additional humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. One Cabinet member expressed relief, stating, “I thought we would be embarrassed if they made demands that Japan could not comply with, such as providing weapons.” A senior Foreign Ministry official also said, “I am glad that Ukraine did not make a request for aid in arms.” This is indeed the reality in Japanese politics.\n\nDuring a press conference at the Japan National Press Club on April 1, Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Korsunsky explained why Ukraine threw a softball when it came to Japan. The words in the speech were “very carefully chosen,” he said. He added that Ukraine of course knows about Article 9. Zelenskyy’s speech had given consideration to the Japanese political situation indeed, embodying the world’s expectations of Japan today and highlighting its limitations.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Japan’s security policy is constrained. Article 9 of the Constitution — the one Garcia said gave him hope for the future development of ties between Japan and the Philippines — prescribes the “renunciation of war,” the prohibition of “war potential,” and the denial of “the right of belligerency of the state.” The current Constitution does not give legal grounds for the type of military assistance requested by Ukraine of Western countries. Following the crisis in Ukraine, the Japanese government hastily revised the operational guidelines of the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and provided bulletproof vests to Ukraine — but full-scale arms transfers are still not legally permissible. The reality is that “this is the limit of what Japan can do at this point,” according to Japanese government officials and politicians.\n\nIn lieu of full-scale military assistance, the Japanese government has joined other G7 nations in imposing economic sanctions on Russia. Japan has also provided humanitarian assistance, including dispatching Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi to Poland to bring 20 evacuees from Ukraine to Japan on a government plane. This should be commended.\n\nYet the question remains whether Japan should stay as it is. In post-World War II Japan, the argument in support of maintaining Article 9 of the Constitution as a means to protect the country has been made, mainly by liberals. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought home to many in Japan the reality that, even with the establishment of the current international order supported by international laws, a country can unilaterally attempt to challenge the status quo by using its military force.\n\nThe Far East has many red lines. China is a neighbor that exerts military pressure on others in the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea and the South China Sea through its military power. North Korea has been extending the range of its ballistic missiles with the aim of acquiring the capability to break through the Japanese and U.S. missile defense systems. Japan arguably faces its most severe security environment since World War II.\n\nThe state of national defense should be a focus of the House of Councillors elections coming in July. We must debate how to strengthen deterrence amid growing security concerns. In this era of massive change, it is important to return to the Constitution to tackle fundamental issues. Public debate must be deepened from a broad perspective because the world will never go back to the way it was before the Ukraine war.\n\nBy Yuko Mukai\n\nAsia News Network: The Nation (Thailand), The Korea Herald, The Straits Times (Singapore), China Daily, Jakarta Post, The Star and Sin Chew Daily (Malaysia), The Statesman (India), Philippine Daily Inquirer, Yomiuri Shimbun and The Japan News, Gogo Mongolia, Dawn (Pakistan), The Island (Sri Lanka), Kuensel (Bhutan), Kathmandu Post (Nepal), Daily Star (Bangladesh), Eleven Media (Myanmar), the Phnom Penh Post and Rasmei Kampuchea (Cambodia), The Borneo Bulletin (Brunei), Vietnam News, and Vientiane Times (Laos).', 'image': 'https://media.nationthailand.com/uploads/images/md/2022/04/NjCR9LDn62a2PtadS2Nk.webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:17'}

Photo: @Ukraine via Twitter\n\nTOKYO — The Ukrainian government has apologized for tweeting a video featuring a picture of Japan’s wartime emperor, Hirohito, alongside Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, renewing a debate on the Japanese monarch’s responsibility for the country’s World War II atrocities.\n\nUkraine’s official account deleted the video on Sunday and said it had “no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan” following a protest by the Japanese government. A senior Japanese official on Monday called the now-deleted video, which was posted on April 1, “inappropriate and extremely regrettable.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe video was meant to be a social media campaign condemning fascism and the Russian invasion of its neighbor, for which Japan has sanctioned Moscow.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has deleted the original tweet and posted a new version of the video without any Japanese figure, but the removal has ignited a debate about whether it was wrong to compare fascist leaders to Japan’s wartime emperor, who was head of state during Japan’s imperial expansion and militarization.\n\nEmperor Shōwa, widely known as Hirohito, ruled Japan from 1926 until his death in 1989, including the period from the invasion of China in 1937 to the end of WWII in 1945 when Japanese soldiers killed 3–10 million people. But some historians and officials argue that he was a mere figurehead and lacked real power, thus void of responsibility for the country’s actions.\n\nMasahisa Sato, the head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s foreign policy panel, tweeted that he urged the Japanese foreign ministry to protest the video posted on Ukraine’s official account. “Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affair needs to get it together and do a better job” in preventing such videos, he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian embassy in Japan also distanced themselves from the original Ukrainian tweet, saying that the creators of the video lacked “historical awareness.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut others have disagreed and said it’s historically accurate to group the emperor with Hitler and Mussolini.\n\n“[The] Japanese feel uncomfortable with him being likened to Hitler and Mussolini, two dictators, as they find the then prime minister, Tojo Hideki, more similar image-wise” to the German and Italian leaders, Akira Yamada, a professor at Meiji University who studies Japanese modern history and its imperial system, told VICE World News.\n\n“But he was the head of state, so from an international and legal standpoint, it isn’t wrong to place him side by side,” he said.\n\nYamada argued that it is wrong, as many loyalists do, to absolve Hirohito of Japan’s wartime atrocities by claiming he didn’t know the full extent of Japanese militarism.\n\n“He was the only one in Japan who had complete power over the army and navy—he was well aware of what was happening, but believed it couldn’t be helped because they were in the midst of war,” he said.\n\nDuring WWII, Japan invaded China as part of its plans for imperial expansion and search for natural resources. At the beginning of this invasion, Japan also carried out mass killing and ravaging of Chinese civilians—now known as the Rape of Nanking—over a six-week period. By the time the war ended, China had suffered 15 million deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Japan’s occupied territories, which include South Korea and the Philippines, the Imperial Japanese Army also forced women and girls into sexual slavery and euphemistically called them “comfort women.”\n\nUnlike other Japanese officials, Hirohito was exempted from prosecution of war crimes following Japan’s defeat. Later documents would also show how he had wanted in 1952 to express regret and remorse for Japan’s actions during WWII, but was stopped by the prime minister at the time.\n\nThe Japanese narrative around Hirohito’s culpability—or the lack thereof—was shaped also by the U.S.-led forces that occupied Japan following the war, which sought to preserve Japan’s national identity, said Yusuke Suzumura, an associate professor of political history at Meijo University.\n\n“After the war, the Allied forces kept Japan’s imperial system because they understood how devastating it’d be for the Japanese people if he were gone,” he told VICE World News.\n\n“So many people in Japan learn that the former emperor was a figurehead, though he signed the papers allowing Japan to go to war,” he said.\n\nYamada at Meiji University also said that both Japanese and U.S. officials avoided blaming Hirohito for wartime atrocities because it would dishearten Japanese citizens. “Throughout the war, the Japanese people were taught that they had to sacrifice their lives for the emperor, so then to claim that he was wrong or he committed wrongdoings would mean all their sacrifices would be wasted,” he said.\n\nAfter the official Ukrainian Twitter account deleted the video, the Japanese government accepted Ukraine’s apology and reassured the nation of its continued support in its war with Russia.\n\nJapan has been staunchly supporting Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an attack in late February. It has imposed sanctions on Russia and sent non-lethal weapons to Ukraine, in a break from its usual pacifist stance.\n\nIt’s also offered nonpermanent refugee status to over 680 Ukrainians as of Saturday, despite taking a traditionally sparing approach to asylum seekers. In 2020, it granted refugee status to merely 47 people.', 'image': 'https://video-images.vice.com/articles/626685d387bbc4009b06101e/lede/1650886100938-screen-shot-2022-04-25-at-82521-pm.png?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MC45NTkyMDEzODg4ODg4ODg4eGg7Y2VudGVyLGNlbnRlciZyZXNpemU9MTIwMDoqJnJlc2l6ZT0xMjAwOio', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:41'}

It’s not in bullets,” Morrison told 2GB on April 26 in reference to the emerging field of cyber warfare, which has seen governments invest billions in counteracting increasingly sophisticated hacking activities.\n\n“A lot of the focus has been on the nuclear-powered submarines,” he said. “But the AUKUS agreement is way bigger ensuring that we have a comprehensive defence in modern warfare.”\n\nThe headline initiative from AUKUS is Australia’s potential acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines from the United States and United Kingdom, a highly classified technology that was shared only once to the British in 1958.\n\nIn this handout image provided by the U.S. Navy, the nuclear-powered fast attack submarine USS Hartford is moored off the U.S, Naval Academy in 1999 in Annapolis, Maryland. (Don S. Montgomery/U.S. Navy via Getty Images)\n\nYet, AUKUS has ushered in close collaboration between the allies in other advanced fields including quantum technology, undersea capabilities (drones), hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, and advanced cyber.\n\n“We prepare for these things to ensure we can keep stability and peace within our region. That’s why we did the AUKUS agreement … That’s why we drove the step up of the QUAD,” Morrison said, referring to the security dialogue between Australia, Japan, United States, and India.\n\nThe prime minister said the efforts were designed to “counterbalance” the expansionist activities of the CCP in the South China Sea and more recently the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe federal opposition Labor Party has launched an ongoing political campaign criticising the Morrison government for not preventing the Beijing-Solomon Islands security deal from happening—a stance experts say is unrealistic.\n\nThe deal, in essence, would allow the CCP—with the consent of the Solomons—to dispatch police, troops, weapons, and even naval ships to “protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in the Solomon Islands.”\n\nIf fully realised, it would extend the reach of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army into the heart of the South Pacific just 1,700 kilometres (1,050 miles) from Australia’s northern city of Cairns.\n\nMap of Australia’s immediate neighbours in the western Pacific Ocean. (College of Asia and the Pacific/ANU/CartoGIS Services [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Penny Wong, Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman, called it the “worst foreign policy blunder,” claiming the government’s lack of engagement in the region opened the door for Beijing.\n\n“The government should have acted sooner. We live in a world where the strategic circumstances we face are riskier and more uncertain than in any time since the end of World War II,” she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on April 20.\n\nMorrison however said he was one of the few Australian leaders to visit Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands in recent times, while also noting the opening of six diplomatic missions in the South Pacific.\n\n“We are concerned for all of the countries in the region,” he said. “There are 20 Pacific Island foreign nations … there are 20 areas which we’re looking to ensure we counter that (CCP) influence.”\n\nMorrison warned last week that Australia’s northern neighbour, Papua New Guinea, was facing “pressure” from Beijing to consent to a similar security agreement to the one with the Solomons.\n\n“We’re the only country in the world to have an embassy in every single one of those Pacific island nations,” he added. “So it’s an area which is tightly contested, and we’ve always been heavily forward leaning. But we’re dealing with the Chinese government that doesn’t play by the same rules.”', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/26/20220426001651824138-original-min-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:55'}

I think that’s the sobering reality of where we are. It’s a sobering reality of the intelligence that we receive,” he told Nine.\n\nThis followed Morrison’s declaration at the weekend, in the context of the Chinese-Solomons agreement, that “working together with our partners in New Zealand and of course the United States, I share the same red line that the United States has when it comes to these issues”.\n\n“We won’t be having Chinese military naval bases in our region on our doorstep.”\n\nLabor’s deputy leader Richard Marles said Australia’s current strategic circumstances “are as complex as any point since the end of the Second World War.\n\n“And we certainly need to prepare. But we have not seen the preparation under this government. And words are one thing, action is another.\n\n“This is a government which beats its chest, but when it comes to actually delivering and doing what needs to be done, this is a government which repeatedly fails.”\n\nThe government has said there have been clear statements from the Solomons prime minister that there would not be a Chinese military base built there. But based on Chinese conduct previously, the Australian government is skeptical about such assurances.\n\nBoth Morrison and Marles were in Darwin for Anzac Day.\n\nLabor’s seven-point Pacific plan will include a boost to development aid, support on climate infrastructure, improvements to Pacific labor arrangements both to help address economic challenges in the Pacific and ease Australia’s agricultural worker shortages, and a restoration of bipartisan parliamentary engagement.\n\nAustralia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he has pushed back hard against Chinese economic pressures.

If net zero is alive and kicking, why are European countries desperate for our coal right now?\n\n"I think right now, in the time of where we\'re facing Chinese aggression in our region, we\'ve got to focus on real things to protect this country."\n\nSenator Canavan said he couldn\'t care less for how his comments would be interpreted by Mr Morrison or the Liberals, or what his point of view could do in terms of destabilising the Coalition election pitch on climate.\n\n"This issue had gone away, it had been side-lined a little bit because you had the Coalition and Labor agreeing to [net zero by] 2050. I doubt the Prime Minister is happy with you," host Ally Langdon said.\n\n"I\'m not focused on the Prime Minister or ... anyone else in Canberra," Senator Canavan replied.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg immediately went into damage control, moving to debunk Senator Canavan\'s claims and play down potential division between the Liberals and Nationals.\n\n"Net zero by the Coalition is clear and non-negotiable," Mr Frydenberg told Today.\n\n"This is not breaking news from Matt Canavan. This is old news.\n\n"He\'s held that position for some time, but it\'s not the position of his party, it\'s not the position of my party, and it\'s not the position of the Coalition."\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison insisted net zero by 2050 was the government\'s "absolute policy". (9News)\n\nThe Queensland Senator\'s comments, including that he "didn\'t believe" the net-zero commitments by his own government or any others around the world, ran directly counter to Mr Morrison\'s assurances yesterday.\n\nThe Prime Minister insisted Mr Boyce, the Nationals candidate for Flynn, which is in and around regional Queensland city of Gladstone, was talking about "how we get there".\n\n"He wasn\'t talking about the commitment himself and he\'s clarified that today," Mr Morrison said on Tuesday.\n\n"Our commitment to net zero by 2050 is a commitment of the Australian government that I made in Glasgow.\n\n"It is the government\'s absolute policy."\n\nREAD MORE: Diners evacuated after Sydney restaurant catches fire\n\nHe said Labor\'s plans to get the country to net zero by 2050 would affect a range of key industries such as oil, gas, cement and rail freight "penalised and taxed".\n\n"Our approach is to incentivise the change," he said.\n\n"Our approach (is) with the hydrogen hubs carbon capture, use and storage, $22 billion of investment under the plan that Angus Taylor has put together to get us to net zero by 2050, through technology, not burdensome taxes on the Australian people."\n\nMr Morrison was able to take the goal to the COP26 global climate summit after a week of hard-fought negotiations with the Nationals .\n\nThe agreement followed years of ugly political fights over climate action that played a key role in bringing down several prime ministers and party leaders.\n\n"Australia adopts a target of net zero emissions by 2050. This is an economy-wide target, covering all sectors and gases included in Australia\'s national inventory," Australia told the United Nations at the time .\n\nWhen politicians facing the public gets ugly View Gallery\n\nBut the Nationals leader was less definitive than his Coalition partner when asked about Mr Boyce\'s comments on Tuesday, backing in his candidate.\n\n"We\'ve said we\'ve set a target, we\'re going to try and meet ... but I think where Colin\'s coming from, it\'s completely understandable," Mr Joyce told AAP.\n\n"Coal remains one of our nation\'s strongest exports.\n\n"If you start getting rid of one of our major exports, then our key economic strength is affected."\n\nLabor Senator Murray Watt said the Morrison government\'s net-zero policy was a "farce" and questioned what the latest developments would mean for Liberals under pressure from climate-motivated independents in inner-city seats.\n\n"Over the last 24 hours, we\'ve seen the split between the Liberal and the National Party on this issue widen in the middle of an election campaign, with Nationals saying that this policy is not binding and any number of Liberals saying that it is binding," he told the ABC.\n\n"But now we\'ve got a member of the National Party and the government saying that the policy is entirely dead.\n\n"That is a huge development and Scott Morrison has got to actually say to people whether this policy is real or not."\n\nLabor has committed to net zero by 2050 and a 43 per cent drop in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 if elected, more ambitious than the Coalition\'s 35 per cent target.\n\nGermany\'s government says it is still committed to ending coal-fired power "ideally" by 2030 but is delaying the closure of some plants and building some liquefied natural gas terminals to replace reliance on the massive Nordstream pipeline from Russia.\n\nItaly\'s Prime Minister Mario Draghi in February said it might be necessary to reopen coal plants.', 'image': 'https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/DJzmlFnzDxCp-enmBktaXDeupoY=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Ff57a4c37-5a0e-4da8-9ab9-0acedcd643bd', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:59:09'}

(AAP Image/Mick Tsikas)\n\nWho Are Australia’s Liberals?\n\nCommentary\n\nThe 1987 election was the first I took an interest in. Seeing two politicians of conviction, Bob Hawke and John Howard, lay out their vision for this country in a real contest of ideas and philosophies, I became “hooked” on politics.\n\nAs time went on, I realised that the centre-right Liberal Party had the ideals and policies that were best for Australia. Through John Howard’s triumph of 1996, his defeat in 2007, and the hope that came with the election of Tony Abbott, I knew what the Liberals stood for and how they were different from the centre-left Labor Party.\n\nBut now I’m not so sure. With the lack of centre-right product differentiation that is a hallmark of the Turnbull-Morrison Liberals, there are too many things the major parties either agree on, or they agree not to talk about.\n\nThe Liberals joined Labor in adopting “net-zero 2050,” thinking it might have been a necessary political gesture, yet seemingly ignoring that Australians have voted against the party promising the most drastic “climate action” at every electoral opportunity, notably in 2019.\n\nResearch from the Institute of Public Affairs shows 17 of the top 20 electorates with the highest proportion of jobs at risk from a “net-zero” emissions target are held by the Coalition, including six Nationals seats.\n\nThe other elephant in the room about net-zero—which dare not be pointed out by Prime Minister Scott Morrison or Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese—is that it is contingent upon technological breakthroughs, many of which are still in their infancy.\n\nThe Liberals’ traditional electoral appeal as prudent economic managers has also been abandoned. Yet, the record debt Prime Minister Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg have racked up isn’t the only fiscal problem.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg conducting breakfast television after Treasurer Frydenberg delivered the 2021-22 Budget in the House of Representatives at Parliament House last night in Canberra, Australia, May 12, 2021. (AAP Image/Mick Tsikas)\n\nMorrison says, “Labor wants to let rip on taxes.” But the Liberals would be in a much stronger position to prosecute that case against Labor if it weren’t for the fact that Australia’s personal and corporate tax rates are among the highest in the OECD. Moreover, Australia has an over-reliance on personal income tax over consumption taxes—at 41 percent.\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 1960, family businesses contributed 26 percent to Australia’s national income. That figure is now nine percent.\n\nAfter three terms in government, the Coalition has done nothing to play to its traditional strengths. So why would it change tack in a fourth?\n\nUnfortunately, the Australian political debate has never been more vacuous, moribund, and bereft of ideas. Both Morrison and Albanese are manifestly unwilling to talk about the issues that are so vital to our prosperity.\n\nNeither is talking about the colossal debt Australia finds itself in or offering any credible plan to repay it. Nor do they mention the inflationary crisis into which we are sleepwalking. Neither is talking seriously about defence, national security, or energy independence—again, traditional Liberal strengths—which, given the war in Ukraine and China’s recent ban on the export of urea, should be a top priority.\n\nAnd neither is talking about our fundamental freedoms—our inalienable rights to free speech, movement, assembly and work that have been heinously trashed over the past two years and which must be restored.\n\nLeader of the Opposition Anthony Albanese (left) on Dec. 11, 2020, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison (right) on Dec. 9, 2020, in Canberra, Australia. (Sam Mooy/Getty Images)\n\nIn fact, if you compare the Liberal party’s statement of beliefs to the actions of the Morrison government, it could be said that it is now very illiberal.\n\nIt was Scott Morrison who said, “free speech doesn’t create a single job.” But freedom is not, as Morrison seems to believe, something government owns and will “return” to us if we do as we are told. That leads to tyranny.\n\nIn 1974, our longest-serving prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies, wrote a letter to his daughter Heather, despairing about the party’s Victorian state executive. He observed it was: “dominated by what they now call ‘Liberals with a small ‘l’’—that is to say, Liberals who believe in nothing but who still believe in anything if they think it is worth a few votes. The whole thing is tragic.”\n\nTwo years earlier, in the 1972 election, disgusted with what the then-Liberals had become, Menzies cast his vote not for the party he founded and led for 22 years but for B.A. Santamaria’s Democratic Labour Party.\n\nSome 50 years later, we may well ask the question: is history repeating itself? It isn’t hard to find evidence in support.\n\nJust take a look at the absence of the word “Liberal” on Member for Wentworth Dave Sharma’s campaign posters. The problem is that when the Liberal Party moves closer to the Labor Party, it dismays its own best supporters without gaining any new ones.\n\nThe phenomenon of a lack of political choice is reflected in the growing support for minor parties. Many cannot, in good conscience, cast a vote for the “least unimpressive” alternative, let alone candidates who are seemingly ashamed of displaying the name of the party they represent.\n\nFormer Prime Minister John Howard speaks at the Liberal party’s campaign launch for its candidate in the NSW seat of Bennelong, Simon Kennedy, at the Ryde-Eastwood Leagues Club in Sydney, Australia, on April 23, 2022. (AAP Image/Paul Braven)\n\nIn his autobiography “Lazarus Rising,” John Howard stated that the Liberal Party is the party of both Edmund Burke and John Stuart Mill. It is the party of both conservatism and classical liberalism. Historically, the Liberals have been electorally successful when espousing these philosophies simultaneously.\n\nUnder Howard and Abbott, they had policies to unite the base around shared values of social conservatives and economic dries: lower taxes, smaller government, the reward for individual effort, defence of the family, and the importance of national sovereignty, the rule of law and, above all, individual liberty.\n\nMenzies’ “forgotten people,” who he asserted were the “backbone of the nation” because they were “envied by those whose benefits are largely obtained by taxing them”, became “Howard’s battlers,” “Tony’s tradies” and dare I say it, the “quiet Australian.”\n\nAfter eight years of Coalition government, the quiet Australians have reason to be very aggrieved. However, if the Liberals lose this election, it will be because they have forgotten what it means to be Liberals.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/26/20220423001650596750-original-min-1200x800-1-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:42'}

The Chinese foreign ministry also said the pact aimed to promote peace and security.\n\nThe final document the countries signed has not been released to the public but a draft document - leaked in March by political opponents of Sogavare - indicated that the Solomon Islands would have the ability to request police or military personnel from China to maintain social order or help with disaster relief, while Chinese naval ships would be permitted to dock for resupply and crew transfers.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina may be able to place military equipment and personnel station in the country with the Solomon Islands government\'s consent.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Beijing was committed to helping the Solomon Islands "strengthen its capacity to maintain its own security", with areas for cooperation to include "social order, protecting people\'s lives and property, humanitarian assistance and natural disaster response". He did not mention details relating to military cooperation.\n\nSolomon Islands officials emphasised that the pact with China "had solely domestic applications", telling the US delegation that "there would be no military base, no long-term presence, and no power projection capability" as a result of the agreement.\n\nChina maintains just one military base beyond its borders, in Djibouti; a base in the Solomon Islands would be its first in the Pacific. In comparison, the US has nearly 800 bases in more than 70 countries and territories around the world.\n\nSogavare said this month that his country would not allow a Chinese base to be established and that his government was conscious of the "security ramification" of hosting a military base.\n\nThe pact is seen as Beijing\'s latest power play in a struggle for influence in the region, with the US, Australia and New Zealand expressing concern over what they regard as a lack of transparency over the agreement and the security implications of more Chinese military forces in the Pacific.\n\nThe confirmation of the pact came as Washington warned that the deal would destabilise the region.\n\nOn Tuesday, Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the deal showed a "complete lack of transparency" and the US would respond accordingly to any attempt by Beijing at establishing military presence in the Pacific island country.\n\nThe senior US official was part of a high-level delegation from the United States, led by US President\'s Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell, which visited the Solomon Islands on Friday after Honiara confirmed the signing of the agreement with Beijing.\n\nAustralian Defence Minister Peter Dutton called the security pact "aggressive", while shadow foreign affairs minister Penny Wong said the region had "become less secure" because of it.\n\nAustralia, which is the Solomons\' biggest donor of aid and has security ties with it, had tried to press its neighbour to step away from Beijing.\n\nNew Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said last week that Auckland had made clear to both the Solomon Islands and China its grave concerns at the pact\'s potential to destabilise the Pacific region\'s security.\n\nSogavare has urged critics to respect the country\'s sovereign interests and said that its traditional partners, such as Australia and New Zealand, remained important.\n\n"We entered into an arrangement with China with our eyes wide open, guided by our national interests," he said, adding that the pact would not "undermine peace and harmony" in the region.\n\nThe new agreement comes as Beijing is stepping up political, economic and security ties with South Pacific countries.\n\nMany countries in the region have established economic deals with China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.

But not since World War II has the public holiday been so openly linked to preparations for a major new war whose horrors would dwarf those of the 20th century conflagrations.\n\nThe Liberal-National Coalition government and the Labor Party opposition spent yesterday competing with one another over who would be best placed to join the US in an aggressive war against China. Amid what has been dubbed a “khaki election,” both made more public and explicit than ever before decade-long preparations for Australia to play a front-line role in Washington’s war drive against Beijing.\n\nPeter Dutton at the Australian War Memorial on Anzac Day [Credit: Facebook, PeterDuttonMP]\n\nThe day began with defence minister Peter Dutton declaring, on breakfast television, that “The only way you can preserve peace is to prepare for war, and be strong as a country. Not to cower, not to be on bended knee and be weak. That’s the reality.”\n\nThe government has dispensed with even a pretence of diplomacy. In earlier years, it would refer to “rising tensions” in the Indo-Pacific region and insinuate that they were the product of supposed Chinese aggression, without naming that country. Now, there are no such qualms.\n\nDutton stated: “The Chinese, through their actions, through their words, are on a very deliberate course at the moment, and we have to stand up with countries to stare down any act of aggression.”\n\nThe Coalition, together with Labor, has fully supported the US-NATO proxy war against Russia, including through the provision of more than $150 million in weaponry to Ukraine’s far-right government. Australia’s particular contribution to the US campaign has been to link the issues of Russia and China, which the government has begun describing as an “arc of autocracy.”\n\nDutton said that the period today was “very similar to the 1930s…We have to be realistic that people like Hitler and others aren’t just a figment of our imagination or that they’re consigned to history. We have in President Putin, at the moment, somebody who is willing to kill women and children. That’s happening in the year 2022.” China, he suggested, was little different.\n\nThe gratuitous description of Putin relativises the Holocaust and turns reality on its head. Putin’s reactionary invasion is a desperate response to the encirclement of Russia by the US and NATO, which, over the past 30 years have carried out illegal wars, the criminality of which are unprecedented since the Third Reich.\n\nBut more significant than the falsifications contained in Dutton’s statements were their implications. If the Australian government, together with the US, declares that Putin and Chinese President Xi are akin to the Nazis, the logical conclusion is that war is inevitable.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison made clear that such a conflict is not in the distant future but something that the government is actively stoking in the present.\n\nAmid a hysterical furore over the signing of a security pact between China and the Solomon Islands last week, Morrison has repeatedly declared that the establishment of any Chinese military presence in the tiny Pacific Island nation would be his government’s “red line.” The term is unambiguous. If a “red line” is crossed, war is launched.\n\nA journalist noted this and asked Morrison how his government would enforce such a “red line.” Morrison responded by pointing to the AUKUS agreement, an aggressive military pact between the US, the UK and Australia, unveiled last September. Its purpose was not just to facilitate Australia’s acquisition of a new fleet of nuclear armed submarines. Instead it extended to every area of military preparation.\n\nThe government is collaborating closely with Washington and London on a vast expansion of cyber-warfare capabilities. At the same time, it has initiated a program to acquire a range of conventional missiles, and is planning on the establishment of a new naval military base on the country’s east coast. AUKUS announced last month that it was turning to the development of new generation hypersonic missiles, which could potentially be armed with nuclear weapons.\n\nAustralia’s military spending sits at over $600 billion this decade, and more than two percent of annual gross domestic product, as the country is placed on a war footing.\n\nThe aggressive statements on Anzac Day were immediately condemned by Chinese officials, who said claims that Beijing was preparing to establish a military base on the Solomons were “fake news.” Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who has been hectored and threatened by the US and Australia, similarly declared his government would not permit any base.\n\nThe real driving force of the US-led confrontation was hinted at by Morrison. He said that the “arc of autocracy” was “challenging the rules-based order our grandparents secured,” i.e., in WWII. Put into plain English, the threats against China are aimed at ensuring the US imperialist hegemony secured through war 80 years ago, including the transformation of the Pacific Ocean into what leading military generals described as an “American lake.”\n\nThe most striking aspect of the government’s open preparations for war, is that they are not opposed in the slightest by any section of the political and media establishment. The Labor Party, in particular, is not condemning the Coalition from the standpoint that its threats risk a catastrophe. Instead, it is pitching itself as a more reliable vehicle for implementing the demands of the US and Australian military-security establishments.\n\nLabor’s foreign affairs shadow minister Penny Wong has accused the government of the “greatest foreign policy failure” since WWII, because it failed to scuttle the China-Solomon agreement. Today, she is touring the increasingly militarised north of Australia, which would play a key role in any conflict with China, to advance Labor’s alternative policy in the Pacific. It entails a campaign to link the militaries of the various Pacific Island nations to Canberra and a major “soft power” campaign that will amount to sweeping interference in their internal affairs.\n\nLabor’s deputy leader, who is also in Darwin, where the previous Labor government established a US marine base in 2010, accepted entirely the premise that it was necessary to plan for war. “[C]ertainly, we need to prepare, but we have not seen the preparation under this government,” he stated.\n\nIn other words, Labor is effectively criticising the government from the right, condemning it for not pursuing the military build-up with sufficient speed. Albanese has bemoaned the fact that there is not yet a near-term timetable for the acquisition of a fleet of nuclear-armed submarines. He has suggested fitting the existing diesel-powered vessels with Tomahawk missiles in the interim.\n\nLast week, Labor’s shadow defence minister Brendan O’Connor denounced the government for abandoning a $1.3 billion program to purchase unarmed drones. This decision was “bewildering,” he said, and would be reviewed by a Labor government “as a matter of urgency.”\n\nO’Connor stated: “It is incumbent upon any government to assess our capability gaps now, not just in the medium to long term. We’d be looking at increasing firepower and certain defence assets where we are deficient, and I would suggest one of the areas that’s deficient includes uncrewed, armed drones.” That is, Labor would prepare for imminent war.\n\nThe open discussion of the war preparations express how advanced they are. It is also an attempt to condition public opinion under conditions of widespread hostility to militarism. The government and Labor are in their deepest crisis in decades. Both are widely despised for their massive handouts to big business, cuts to health and education, and refusal to address a cost of living and low wages crisis.\n\nBut the danger is that absent a political movement of the working class, the war preparations are able to proceed, even as they are overseen by unpopular parties with no mandate for their criminally reckless policies.

Or, at least that’s the story told from a steady stream of commentary bemoaning supposed U.S. neglect of its Middle East partners.\n\nFiras Maksad of the Middle East Institute, for example, dubbed the rift a “crisis” in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in March calling on Biden to renew the U.S.’s “commitment to regional defense by publicly affirming a strategic alliance” with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, or both countries will continue to cozy up to Beijing and Moscow.\n\nOn CNN Maksad argued the United States was shirking its role as “underwriter of regional security,” which, “sends alarm bells ringing both in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi and has them thinking about how to diversify away from the United States even further.”\n\nMaksad’s MEI colleagues, Bilal Saab and Karen Young, kept up the drumbeat in early April with a Foreign Policy article arguing for a new U.S. “strategic defense framework with the Gulf Arab states.” The article followed an MEI policy memo accusing the United States of being supportive of Iran’s expansionism which, amongst other issues, purportedly pushed Saudi Arabia and the UAE closer to China and Russia.\n\nNoticeably absent from these documents and media appearances clamoring for more U.S. military entanglements with Saudi Arabia and the UAE is any acknowledgement that MEI’s biggest funders are the UAE and Saudi Arabia. In fact, in 2017, leaked emails revealed a $20 million “secret” grant from the UAE to MEI.\n\nMaksad also has personal ties to Saudi and Emirati money as Responsible Statecraft has previouslypointed out. Maksad is the Managing Director of Global Policy Associates which, prior to RS’s reporting, listed Teneo as one of the firms’ clients. Teneo, incidentally, is registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to represent multiple Saudi and Emirati interests.\n\nThe Middle East Institute did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMEI isn’t alone — Saudi Arabia and the UAE have funded a number of think tanks in Washington, D.C. In fact, the UAE is one of the top foreign funders of think tanks in the United States. While none of these think tanks acts like a “lobbying firm” — as Saab himself explained to the UAE’s Ambassador to the U.S., Yousef Otaiba, in a leaked email — these think tanks often spread pro-Saudi and UAE messaging and silence critiques of these Gulf dictatorships. All while masquerading as objective without disclosing their conflicts of interest.\n\nAs Eli Clifton and I argue in a Quincy Institute report highlighting the perils of think tanks’ donor secrecy, it’s not enough for think tanks to just provide a list of donors on their website — as MEI does — they must also “publicize conflict-of-interest policies and proactively identify the appearance of conflicts of interest between institutional funders, or staff conducting outside political work, and a think tank’s institutional research products.” Claims of “intellectual independence” ring hollow when used to defend work products that serve the interests of top funders.\n\nMedia outlets also have an obligation to acknowledge these potential conflicts of interest. By failing to disclose these funding ties, Foreign Policy, The Wall Street Journal, and CNN are omitting critical information that could put these experts’ comments into better perspective. If, for example, consumers of these analyses knew that MEI’s top funder was the UAE, they wouldn’t be surprised when none of them mentions the multiple times top UAE officials have been accused of illegally meddling in U.S. politics and elections as a possible cause of tensions between the UAE and the United States\n\nAt a time when the public’s trust in government and media is near record lows, it’s incumbent upon think tanks and media outlets to be as transparent as possible with the consumers of their work.\n\nEditor’s note: This article has been updated for clarity.', 'image': 'https://responsiblestatecraft.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-07-05T000000Z_1781789242_RC2GEO98BC6D_RTRMADP_3_SAUDI-EMIRATES-scaled.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:59:21'}

Denisov responded that Russia is willing to deepen the partnership.\n\nThe meeting between Le Yucheng and Denisov came a day before the UN General Assembly debated a draft resolution limiting the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council. So far, the resolution has been supported by 57 countries, including the United States.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, the UN Security Council voted on a resolution condemning Russia’s aggression, but it was vetoed by Russia, which is a permanent member. China has consistently refrained from publicly condemning Russia and has also fallen behind many other countries in supplying humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\nChina has repeatedly mentioned Sino-Russian cooperation during the past year.\n\nEarly last year, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a statement on the Ministry’s website that “China-Russia strategic cooperation has no limit, no restricted area, no upper limit.”\n\nAt a press conference on Dec. 24 last year, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian once again repeated that “Sino-Russian cooperation has no limit, no restricted area, no upper limit.” China is willing to carry out “all-round mutually beneficial cooperation” with Russia in accordance with the consensus reached by Xi Jinping and Putin, Zhao said.\n\nOn Feb. 4 this year, the day of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics, Xi and Putin issued a joint statement, saying that “the friendship between the two countries has no end, and there is no restricted area for cooperation.”\n\nFurthermore, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attended the Third Afghan Neighboring Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in China on March 30, as well as the separate “troika” meeting with special envoys from China and the United States.\n\nOn the same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin reiterated at a press conference that the “China-Russia cooperation has no upper limit,” explaining that there are three “unlimited” areas—no limit to striving for peace, no limit to safeguarding security, and no limit to opposing hegemony.\n\nNew Cold War\n\nTwo Chinese political analysts, based outside China, interpret the April 18 statement by China’s Foreign Vice Minister Le Yucheng as a public notice from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that China and Russia stand united against the Western democratic camp led by the United States.\n\nJi Da, a current affairs commentator and China Issues expert, called it “a landmark turning point in the CCP’s foreign strategy.”\n\n“The CCP is publicly showing its intention of joining forces with Russia to fight the United States, and the Ukraine war is a symbolic start,” Ji Da told The Epoch Times. “This means that the world situation will undergo major changes in the context of the new Cold War in the U.S.-China bipolar confrontation.”\n\nJi Da said that the CCP’s decision to strengthen its strategic partnership with Russia is actually a last resort because the United States no longer trusts the CCP and regards it as its number one enemy.\n\nWomen and children who have fled war-torn Ukraine emerge from the main railway station near the Ukrainian border in Przemysl, Poland, on March 9, 2022. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nJi Da explained that Xi Jinping abandoned the strategy of “hide your strengths, bide your time and never stand out,” advocated by former CCP leader Deng Xiaoping, and openly competes with the United States for dominance. Statements such as wanting to establish a “community with a shared future for mankind” and a “new international political and economic order,” etc., has aroused alarm in the United States.\n\nIn response to the Foreign Ministry spokesman’s statement regarding the three “unlimited” areas of cooperation, Ji Da said that the CCP’s pledge to cooperate with Russia is “unlimited,” and that it “opposes hegemony” is an effort to unite with Russia against the “rules-based international order” advocated by the United States and other Western countries. “It’s equivalent to openly challenging the United States and starting a confrontation between the two camps,” he said.\n\nUS-China Decoupling\n\nMike Sun, a North American investment consultant and China expert, predicts that despite the CCP’s public support for Russia, it doesn’t dare act rashly for its own interests.\n\nSun told The Epoch Times that senior officials, such as U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, have been warning the CCP that aid provided to Russia will have serious consequences. Recently, even Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the CCP that if they publicly support Russia militarily and in other ways, the United States would impose severe economic sanctions.\n\n“In fact, the United States has already started a plan to decouple from the CCP in a comprehensive way. First, it is high-tech decoupling, then financial decoupling, and then export decoupling,” Sun said.\n\n“If it wasn’t for the pandemic, the decoupling of exports would have happened sooner, and the CCP would not have enjoyed the export dividends last year. The United States has long been preparing to transfer its manufacturing base to Southeast Asia,” he said.\n\nOf course, the CCP is also preparing for the U.S.-China decoupling, Sun added. “For example, the CCP has been hoarding grain. In addition to importing a large amount of grain, Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that the Chinese people’s rice bowls must be firmly held in their hands, and that the bowls be mainly filled with Chinese grains.”", 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/03/21/GettyImages-1182331130-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:36'}

At almost every stop, our delegation was greeted with much fanfare—yet behind closed doors, the message we heard was clear: China is already here, and the United States is falling behind.\n\nChina is projected to surpass the United States as the world’s largest economy by 2028. But relative size is only part of the problem: The Chinese Community Party (CCP) is pursuing an insidious, intentional, and coordinated strategy of economic subversion—a classic form of “hybrid warfare”—that poses an existential threat to US national security. If the United States fails to respond to this threat with its own strategic effort, it risks compromising its global economic and geopolitical leadership.\n\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the epitome of hybrid warfare. Beijing pursues “debt trap” diplomacy, whereby the CCP showers much-needed financing on poor countries with oppressive terms that force the recipients to forfeit direct or indirect control over key strategic assets (such as a ports, airports, rail lines, and highways) if they fail to repay commercial loans. This pattern is evident across the globe as China buys access to strategic strongholds through infrastructure investments, from Greece’s Piraeus port and Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port, to Zambia’s Kenneth Kaunda International Airport and Djibouti’s Doraleh naval port. Its latest target is Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport.\n\nBeijing’s influence over such strategic assets threatens the free flow of goods, the continuity of supply chains, and access to critical minerals and other resources. Meanwhile, China is further expanding its footprint as the largest creditor in Africa, a continent rich in natural resources and economic opportunity. We can expect China’s pattern of conduct, which is inconsistent with Western values—meaning compromised environmental standards, a disregard for the interests of local indigenous populations, and financial terms that are opaque and oppressive—to continue.\n\nIn contrast to the CCP’s deliberate and focused foreign-investment and export-promotion strategy, the US effort in this regard is disjointed, reactive, and plagued by overlapping bureaucratic missions and interagency competition. I witnessed this firsthand when I served in Washington, where one department or agency tries to outdo or undermine another. Attempts to coordinate policy among officials representing varying constituencies are fleeting, with no clear decision maker on top. Some infighting is inevitable—even healthy at times—to arrive at the best policy outcomes. But since the missions and functions associated with US foreign investment, trade promotion, and development finance span so many different agencies, it becomes nearly impossible to unify around one clear strategy.\n\nEven worse, there is widespread confusion both inside and outside of government about where one agency’s mandate begins and another’s ends. For instance, when I met with US economic representatives abroad, they often could not clearly articulate the different capabilities and missions of EXIM, the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Millennium Challenge Corporation, International Trade Administration, Trade and Development Agency, US Agency for International Development, and other arms of the US government.\n\nThese agencies play complementary yet, at times, overlapping roles in US foreign investment, trade promotion, and development finance. If the US government cannot articulate these differences, how can it expect foreign governments or businesses to understand them? This is not the fault of the people in the field who are doing exemplary work in the face of an onslaught of Chinese competition—but rather a result of an uncoordinated bureaucracy in Washington.\n\nFlexible and unified: A strategy for success\n\nTo orchestrate a coordinated economic strategy to counter China, the US goal should not be to emulate or “out-China” China. The United States does not want to win every project or match the CCP’s massive amount of financing (an estimated $18 billion in 2020, or ten times the US spending, for export credit support alone). Nor should the United States lower its business, ethical, or environmental standards to China’s unacceptable level of conduct.\n\nBut there are other steps the United States must take to regain its strategic momentum relative to China.\n\nFirst, the government must adopt more of a private-sector mindset. While Washington should be driven by economic and national-security interests, its approach should be more akin to how businesses win new contracts: identify what customers need, develop solutions to meet those needs, and then clearly communicate the solutions to the marketplace. Too often, we find ourselves learning about projects well after China is already engaged, then being asked to provide an alternative under a short deadline that our bureaucracy simply cannot support. The United States needs to be proactive on important projects and transactions, instead of primarily reacting to Beijing’s moves.\n\nSecond, the United States needs better coordination and consistent policies among agencies to facilitate more compelling and faster proposals to foreign parties. Currently, each US government entity has its own mission and parameters, but by working together, they can offer a more comprehensive solution to foreign countries and businesses purchasing US goods and services. To make it easier on foreign counterparties, US agencies should offer joint financing and terms: For example, start with a simple one-page term sheet, as Under Secretary of State Keith Krach (my former boss and a renowned tech executive from Silicon Valley) used to tell me frequently. Teams in the field should be educated on all US agencies’ capabilities and then work together to provide the best integrated solution.\n\nThird and perhaps most important, even if we fix the issues in the field, nothing will dramatically change unless we reform Washington. The United States needs more unified leadership in Washington to guide the efforts of the disparate agencies involved in US foreign investment, trade promotion, and development finance. This should involve some type of overarching coordinating authority focused on challenging China’s growing global economic influence—either at the National Security Council or a similar institution that is adept at policy coordination.\n\nAn even bolder move would be to formally consolidate the relevant agencies into one body that can combat Chinese economic aggression and meet other challenges in a more effective and efficient manner. This would require congressional action and could trigger turf battles in the executive branch—but it can be done. The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act, which reorganized and revamped the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to create the DFC, serves as a good model for success. Passed with bipartisan support by Congress in 2018, the BUILD Act established a better funded, more flexible, and expanded US development finance agency primarily to take on China.\n\nThese steps can help the United States stem the long-term global economic influence of China. After all, foreign governments and businesses want to do business with the United States; they often just don’t know how. Washington must make it easier for them.\n\nDavid Fogel is a member of the Atlantic Council’s Gray Zone Task Force, housed in the Scowcroft Center’s Forward Defense practice.

As with Ukraine, the United States compelled Taiwan to give up its nuclear weapons program decades ago. Also, as with Ukraine, the United States restricts the weapons it offers to Taiwan. In hindsight, U.S. failure to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine following the 2014 Russian incursions and twice again in 2021—all intended as de-escalatory olive branches extended to Russia—had the opposite effect on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Given the imbalance of military power across the Taiwan Strait, historical U.S. resistance to offering Taiwan security assistance out of consideration for Beijing has been equally unjustified and counterproductive.\n\nStrategic clarity, however, would not solve this problem. Current U.S. law already provides ample guidance. The Taiwan Relations Act establishes U.S. policy “to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force … that would jeopardize the security” of Taiwan. On the question of security assistance, the statute requires the U.S. government to “make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services” as needed for its self-protection. Prioritizing the U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation relationship is simply a matter of U.S. political will and bureaucratic implementation.\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. president’s statutory obligations to respond to an attack are arguably already commensurate with, and in some ways stronger than, the U.S. mutual defense treaties with the Philippines and Japan, both of which are targets of China’s maritime military coercion. The latter documents obligate the United States to consider an attack on the counterpart to be “dangerous to its own peace and safety” and to “act to meet the common danger.” (This same language was used in the 1954 defense treaty with Taiwan, which the United States abrogated in 1980.)\n\nThe Taiwan Relations Act, by contrast, sets a lower bar to initiate action by directing the president to consult Congress on a response to “any threat [emphasis added] to the security or the social or economic system of” Taiwan. Compared with a defense pact, the president can invoke the act earlier in a crisis—possibly even today.\n\nHaass and Sacks argue that strategic clarity should be accompanied by increased counter-China defense resources and enhanced diplomacy to signal severe economic and political costs in response to aggression. But the U.S. Defense Department has been focused on China as its top long-term priority since early 2018, and the recent implementation of U.S. and allied sanctions on Russia has instructed Beijing more than diplomacy ever could.\n\nTo build on this credibility, the United States must demonstrate willingness to sanction and restrict entities in China whenever appropriate—even at a cost to shorter-term U.S. economic interests. For their part, Edelman and Miller go further, suggesting that the United States deploy forces to Taiwan to train the Taiwanese military. Given revelations that U.S. force rotations to Taiwan already exist, though, no new policy declaration is needed to publicize or expand these programs.\n\nPutin’s trampling of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Ukraine and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s evisceration of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong indicate both leaders respect hard power, not words on paper. It is concrete actions—increased military resources to counter China, demonstrated willingness to enact sanctions, and deployments of U.S. forces in Taiwan—that have and will impact Beijing’s perceptions of U.S. capability and resolve. Such actions can be taken without a U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan.\n\nConversely, a declaration of strategic clarity could instead be counterproductive. A U.S. security guarantee would necessarily come with two caveats or conditions. The first relates to geographic scope. The Taiwan Relations Act (like the mutual defense treaty that preceded it) covers the main island and the nearby Penghu islets, leaving out Taiwan’s outer islands, which include offshore islands along China’s coast and South China Sea features.\n\nWith very little warning, the Chinese military could annex one or more of these isles in a matter of hours—presenting a fait accompli before the United States could respond. And with China’s unparalleled anti-access defenses, not even the U.S. Marines would attempt to reclaim islands within China’s coastal territories. Therefore, a U.S. security guarantee cannot credibly include these outlying islands.\n\nBut even if they are not covered under a defense pact, by annexing them Beijing would diminish U.S. credibility and sow division in Taiwan, just as it has in the Philippines, a longtime U.S. treaty ally.\n\nTen years ago, Beijing ran such a playbook in the South China Sea , leveraging its superior maritime power. China’s armed vessels escalated a jurisdictional fishing dispute at the Philippines-controlled Scarborough Shoal, which China also claims and which is technically not covered by the U.S.-Philippines defense treaty. Washington stepped in to mediate, but Beijing reportedly reneged on an agreement for both claimants to withdraw. Following the Philippines’ withdrawal, the United States did not challenge China’s remaining vessels, effectively ceding control of the shoal to China.\n\nIn the decade following this incident, many in the Philippines, including its president, have expressed resignation to China’s regional dominance and questioned the credibility of the U.S.-Philippines defense pact. Furthermore, the Philippines government delayed key U.S. security cooperation programs that would have enhanced allied deterrence posture vis-à-vis China. Given how Beijing’s 2012 aggression undermined the U.S.-Philippines alliance in Manila, if Washington were to adopt strategic clarity for Taiwan, Beijing might be incentivized to attempt a similar gambit with Taipei by seizing one of its outlying islands.\n\nA second condition of strategic clarity would be a “no Taiwan independence” clause, wherein a U.S. pledge “to come to Taiwan’s aid [would not be] unconditional and would not necessarily cover a crisis initiated by Taipei,” as Haass and Sacks write. But the assignment of blame for initiating a conflict is in the eye of the beholder. Such a caveat would be welcomed by Beijing, which argues that all its coercive measures are in response to provocations by Taipei and Washington. In Beijing’s view, Washington threatens China’s sovereignty by encouraging Taiwan along its steady march toward independence.\n\nWith Ukraine, Chinese officials and media adopted Russia’s narrative that the United States is to blame for having broken a purported promise to not expand NATO eastward. In this reading, Putin was forced to invade Ukraine to block NATO from reaching Russia’s doorstep. Beijing also claims that Washington is acting equally as dangerously in the Indo-Pacific—so presumably Xi will be compelled to prevent Taiwanese independence.\n\nConsidering Taipei’s assertions that Taiwan is “an independent country already,” a conditional U.S. promise to intervene would only provide fodder for China’s global propaganda organs, casting the United States as again reneging on a commitment not to interfere in China’s internal affairs. In practice, the “no independence” condition removes clarity from strategic clarity and enhances China’s propaganda narratives.\n\nLike most Americans, many Taiwanese people naively assume that the U.S. military can save them from subjugation. In truth, however, Taiwan’s inherent capacity to resist an invasion until partners can come to its aid is likely a decisive factor in mounting a successful defense, and therefore in deterring an attack in the first place.\n\nAccording to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), “Taiwan faces significant challenges from decades of underinvestment in defense.” In 2020, Taiwan spent just under 2 percent of its GDP on its military, while many other so-called front-line democracies, including South Korea, India, the Baltic states, Poland, and Israel, all spent more than 2 percent. While Taiwan’s defense budget has inched upward in recent years, a U.S. security guarantee would be counterproductive to overall military deterrence, because it would reduce pressure on the Taiwanese government to further increase defense spending, marginalizing effective capability enhancements such as additional defensive munitions and drones.\n\nLastly, the argument for strategic clarity is premised on the notion that China currently believes the United States will not intervene militarily to defend Taiwan. While Beijing’s propaganda denigrates Washington’s commitment to the region, there is scant evidence that China’s leaders actually believe it. The Chinese Communist Party’s internal doctrine frames the United States as China’s greatest threat , and China’s military likewise assumes U.S. intervention in its planning. In China, U.S. President Joe Biden’s invocations of a commitment to defend Taiwan are viewed as intentional signaling, not as unscripted commentary. As the USCC concluded, “The perceived lack of clarity … may be less relevant to deterrence failure than other factors … given that Chinese leaders already assume U.S. intervention.”\n\nThe instinct to provide a security guarantee to Taiwan arises from deeply held American values. But U.S. adversaries hold different values and are swayed by alternative propositions. Beijing would likely exploit a declaration of strategic clarity and seek to create divisions between Washington and Taipei.\n\nFrom China’s point of view, a decision to invade Taiwan would not be tied to a U.S. security guarantee—Beijing already assumes that Washington will intervene. To enhance military deterrence, Washington must advance credible U.S., Taiwanese, and allied defense postures and capabilities. To increase economic and political deterrence, the United States must demonstrate willingness to hold China accountable and build coalitions to do the same. Given the high stakes, Washington must lead from the front without delay to effectively deter cross-strait aggression.', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/taiwan-military-air-force-defense-GettyImages-1239656630.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:52'}

The Solomons was the seventh country to cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan under President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) administration, leaving it with just four diplomatic allies in the Pacific region.\n\nHowever, last month, a secret draft security agreement between the Solomon Islands and China was leaked onto social media, indicating that there might be more to Beijing’s wooing of the Solomons than initially met the eye that could have profound implications for the security of not just Taiwan, but the entire region.\n\nWhile the final version of the agreement remains unknown — Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has refused requests by opposition politicians to make the document public — the leaked draft allows China to send police and armed forces to “protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects” on the islands. The draft agreement also permits visits by Chinese vessels to replenish supplies, and contains a provision for the Solomon Islands government to request assistance from Chinese police or soldiers to maintain social order.\n\nSogavare has strenuously denied that there is any plan to allow China to construct a military base on the islands. Beijing’s foreign influence operations across Asia and Africa follows a well-rehearsed modus operandi. Commercial interests are gradually ramped up in the target nation until economic dependency is achieved, while political influence is nurtured through bribery and corruption. Elite capture combined with economic capture eventually turns the target nation into a debt-fueled supplicant, giving Beijing free rein to make whatever demands it likes — including the imposition of a military base.\n\nFollowing the leak, the reaction in Washington and Canberra was somewhat muted, indicating that both nations were confident they could dissuade Sogavare from inking a deal with Beijing. This all changed on Tuesday last week, when the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at a regular news conference that the deal had been signed — just days before a US diplomatic delegation was due to arrive in the Solomons for high-level talks.\n\nBeijing has pulled off a major strategic coup on a par with last year’s AUKUS agreement between Australia, the UK and the US. It is a vivid demonstration of a new “great game” between the US and China unfolding, as each power seeks to gain a dominant strategic foothold in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe Solomon Islands’ strategic importance rests on the island of Tulagi, which is home to a deepwater harbor ideally suited to large warships. Tulagi served as a naval base for first British, and then Japanese forces during World War II. Japan sought control of the naval base, as it would have allowed Tokyo to control and disrupt vital shipping and communication lanes that connect North America with Australia and Asia. Beijing appears to be set on succeeding where Japan failed, albeit through more subtle means.\n\nThe establishment of a permanent naval base on Tulagi would have a direct impact on Taiwan’s security by allowing China to bypass the first island chain, and disrupt vital shipping and supply lines to Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan has joined other nations in voicing concern over the agreement, with Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) saying the deal “undermines the ‘status quo’ and the supply lines of democratic allies.”\n\nThere is significant unease among Solomon Islanders over their government’s closeness to China, which last year boiled over into riots. This provides an opening. Working in concert with other concerned nations, including the US, Australia and New Zealand, Taipei must use every tool at its disposal to empower opposition groups and turn the situation around.', 'image': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com/assets/images/TaipeiTimesLogo-1200X1200px_new.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:15'}

China has consistently refrained from publicly condemning Russia and has also fallen behind many other countries in supplying humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\nChina has repeatedly mentioned Sino-Russian cooperation during the past year.\n\nEarly last year, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a statement on the Ministry’s website that “China-Russia strategic cooperation has no limit, no restricted area, no upper limit.”\n\nAt a press conference on Dec. 24 last year, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian once again repeated that “Sino-Russian cooperation has no limit, no restricted area, no upper limit.” China is willing to carry out “all-round mutually beneficial cooperation” with Russia in accordance with the consensus reached by Xi Jinping and Putin, Zhao said.\n\nOn Feb. 4 this year, the day of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics, Xi and Putin issued a joint statement, saying that “the friendship between the two countries has no end, and there is no restricted area for cooperation.”\n\nFurthermore, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attended the Third Afghan Neighboring Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in China on March 30, as well as the separate “troika” meeting with special envoys from China and the United States.\n\nOn the same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin reiterated at a press conference that the “China-Russia cooperation has no upper limit,” explaining that there are three “unlimited” areas—no limit to striving for peace, no limit to safeguarding security, and no limit to opposing hegemony.\n\nNew Cold War\n\nTwo Chinese political analysts, based outside China, interpret the April 18 statement by China’s Foreign Vice Minister Le Yucheng as a public notice from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that China and Russia stand united against the Western democratic camp led by the United States.\n\nJi Da, a current affairs commentator and China Issues expert, called it “a landmark turning point in the CCP’s foreign strategy.”\n\n“The CCP is publicly showing its intention of joining forces with Russia to fight the United States, and the Ukraine war is a symbolic start,” Ji Da told The Epoch Times. “This means that the world situation will undergo major changes in the context of the new Cold War in the U.S.-China bipolar confrontation.”\n\nJi Da said that the CCP’s decision to strengthen its strategic partnership with Russia is actually a last resort because the United States no longer trusts the CCP and regards it as its number one enemy.\n\nWomen and children who have fled war-torn Ukraine emerge from the main railway station near the Ukrainian border in Przemysl, Poland, on March 9, 2022. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nJi Da explained that Xi Jinping abandoned the strategy of “hide your strengths, bide your time and never stand out,” advocated by former CCP leader Deng Xiaoping, and openly competes with the United States for dominance. Statements such as wanting to establish a “community with a shared future for mankind” and a “new international political and economic order,” etc., has aroused alarm in the United States.\n\nIn response to the Foreign Ministry spokesman’s statement regarding the three “unlimited” areas of cooperation, Ji Da said that the CCP’s pledge to cooperate with Russia is “unlimited,” and that it “opposes hegemony” is an effort to unite with Russia against the “rules-based international order” advocated by the United States and other Western countries. “It’s equivalent to openly challenging the United States and starting a confrontation between the two camps,” he said.\n\nUS-China Decoupling\n\nMike Sun, a North American investment consultant and China expert, predicts that despite the CCP’s public support for Russia, it doesn’t dare act rashly for its own interests.\n\nSun told The Epoch Times that senior officials, such as U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, have been warning the CCP that aid provided to Russia will have serious consequences. Recently, even Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the CCP that if they publicly support Russia militarily and in other ways, the United States would impose severe economic sanctions.\n\n“In fact, the United States has already started a plan to decouple from the CCP in a comprehensive way. First, it is high-tech decoupling, then financial decoupling, and then export decoupling,” Sun said.\n\n“If it wasn’t for the pandemic, the decoupling of exports would have happened sooner, and the CCP would not have enjoyed the export dividends last year. The United States has long been preparing to transfer its manufacturing base to Southeast Asia,” he said.\n\nOf course, the CCP is also preparing for the U.S.-China decoupling, Sun added. “For example, the CCP has been hoarding grain. In addition to importing a large amount of grain, Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that the Chinese people’s rice bowls must be firmly held in their hands, and that the bowls be mainly filled with Chinese grains.”", 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/03/21/GettyImages-1182331130-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:36'}

At almost every stop, our delegation was greeted with much fanfare—yet behind closed doors, the message we heard was clear: China is already here, and the United States is falling behind.\n\nChina is projected to surpass the United States as the world’s largest economy by 2028. But relative size is only part of the problem: The Chinese Community Party (CCP) is pursuing an insidious, intentional, and coordinated strategy of economic subversion—a classic form of “hybrid warfare”—that poses an existential threat to US national security. If the United States fails to respond to this threat with its own strategic effort, it risks compromising its global economic and geopolitical leadership.\n\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the epitome of hybrid warfare. Beijing pursues “debt trap” diplomacy, whereby the CCP showers much-needed financing on poor countries with oppressive terms that force the recipients to forfeit direct or indirect control over key strategic assets (such as a ports, airports, rail lines, and highways) if they fail to repay commercial loans. This pattern is evident across the globe as China buys access to strategic strongholds through infrastructure investments, from Greece’s Piraeus port and Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port, to Zambia’s Kenneth Kaunda International Airport and Djibouti’s Doraleh naval port. Its latest target is Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport.\n\nBeijing’s influence over such strategic assets threatens the free flow of goods, the continuity of supply chains, and access to critical minerals and other resources. Meanwhile, China is further expanding its footprint as the largest creditor in Africa, a continent rich in natural resources and economic opportunity. We can expect China’s pattern of conduct, which is inconsistent with Western values—meaning compromised environmental standards, a disregard for the interests of local indigenous populations, and financial terms that are opaque and oppressive—to continue.\n\nIn contrast to the CCP’s deliberate and focused foreign-investment and export-promotion strategy, the US effort in this regard is disjointed, reactive, and plagued by overlapping bureaucratic missions and interagency competition. I witnessed this firsthand when I served in Washington, where one department or agency tries to outdo or undermine another. Attempts to coordinate policy among officials representing varying constituencies are fleeting, with no clear decision maker on top. Some infighting is inevitable—even healthy at times—to arrive at the best policy outcomes. But since the missions and functions associated with US foreign investment, trade promotion, and development finance span so many different agencies, it becomes nearly impossible to unify around one clear strategy.\n\nEven worse, there is widespread confusion both inside and outside of government about where one agency’s mandate begins and another’s ends. For instance, when I met with US economic representatives abroad, they often could not clearly articulate the different capabilities and missions of EXIM, the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Millennium Challenge Corporation, International Trade Administration, Trade and Development Agency, US Agency for International Development, and other arms of the US government.\n\nThese agencies play complementary yet, at times, overlapping roles in US foreign investment, trade promotion, and development finance. If the US government cannot articulate these differences, how can it expect foreign governments or businesses to understand them? This is not the fault of the people in the field who are doing exemplary work in the face of an onslaught of Chinese competition—but rather a result of an uncoordinated bureaucracy in Washington.\n\nFlexible and unified: A strategy for success\n\nTo orchestrate a coordinated economic strategy to counter China, the US goal should not be to emulate or “out-China” China. The United States does not want to win every project or match the CCP’s massive amount of financing (an estimated $18 billion in 2020, or ten times the US spending, for export credit support alone). Nor should the United States lower its business, ethical, or environmental standards to China’s unacceptable level of conduct.\n\nBut there are other steps the United States must take to regain its strategic momentum relative to China.\n\nFirst, the government must adopt more of a private-sector mindset. While Washington should be driven by economic and national-security interests, its approach should be more akin to how businesses win new contracts: identify what customers need, develop solutions to meet those needs, and then clearly communicate the solutions to the marketplace. Too often, we find ourselves learning about projects well after China is already engaged, then being asked to provide an alternative under a short deadline that our bureaucracy simply cannot support. The United States needs to be proactive on important projects and transactions, instead of primarily reacting to Beijing’s moves.\n\nSecond, the United States needs better coordination and consistent policies among agencies to facilitate more compelling and faster proposals to foreign parties. Currently, each US government entity has its own mission and parameters, but by working together, they can offer a more comprehensive solution to foreign countries and businesses purchasing US goods and services. To make it easier on foreign counterparties, US agencies should offer joint financing and terms: For example, start with a simple one-page term sheet, as Under Secretary of State Keith Krach (my former boss and a renowned tech executive from Silicon Valley) used to tell me frequently. Teams in the field should be educated on all US agencies’ capabilities and then work together to provide the best integrated solution.\n\nThird and perhaps most important, even if we fix the issues in the field, nothing will dramatically change unless we reform Washington. The United States needs more unified leadership in Washington to guide the efforts of the disparate agencies involved in US foreign investment, trade promotion, and development finance. This should involve some type of overarching coordinating authority focused on challenging China’s growing global economic influence—either at the National Security Council or a similar institution that is adept at policy coordination.\n\nAn even bolder move would be to formally consolidate the relevant agencies into one body that can combat Chinese economic aggression and meet other challenges in a more effective and efficient manner. This would require congressional action and could trigger turf battles in the executive branch—but it can be done. The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act, which reorganized and revamped the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to create the DFC, serves as a good model for success. Passed with bipartisan support by Congress in 2018, the BUILD Act established a better funded, more flexible, and expanded US development finance agency primarily to take on China.\n\nThese steps can help the United States stem the long-term global economic influence of China. After all, foreign governments and businesses want to do business with the United States; they often just don’t know how. Washington must make it easier for them.\n\nDavid Fogel is a member of the Atlantic Council’s Gray Zone Task Force, housed in the Scowcroft Center’s Forward Defense practice.

But existing U.S. law already provides the policy direction to implement these additional actions. And it is these additional actions—not a new policy proclamation—that would deter Beijing by demonstrating U.S. resolve rather than just talking about it.\n\nIn practice, a U.S. security guarantee is likely to reduce rather than enhance deterrence, as the conditionalities in such a declaration, by circumscribing geographic and political limits, would invite China to exploit those very seams, challenging U.S. credibility. Furthermore, a U.S. commitment would likely stall much-needed defense reforms in Taiwan, while having no real impact on Beijing’s invasion calculus.\n\nFrom an adversary’s perspective, the breadth and depth of U.S. security cooperation are perhaps the most powerful demonstration of American commitment—more so than any mere declaration of intent. As with Ukraine, the United States compelled Taiwan to give up its nuclear weapons program decades ago. Also, as with Ukraine, the United States restricts the weapons it offers to Taiwan. In hindsight, U.S. failure to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine following the 2014 Russian incursions and twice again in 2021—all intended as de-escalatory olive branches extended to Russia—had the opposite effect on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Given the imbalance of military power across the Taiwan Strait, historical U.S. resistance to offering Taiwan security assistance out of consideration for Beijing has been equally unjustified and counterproductive.\n\nStrategic clarity, however, would not solve this problem. Current U.S. law already provides ample guidance. The Taiwan Relations Act establishes U.S. policy “to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force … that would jeopardize the security” of Taiwan. On the question of security assistance, the statute requires the U.S. government to “make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services” as needed for its self-protection. Prioritizing the U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation relationship is simply a matter of U.S. political will and bureaucratic implementation.\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. president’s statutory obligations to respond to an attack are arguably already commensurate with, and in some ways stronger than, the U.S. mutual defense treaties with the Philippines and Japan, both of which are targets of China’s maritime military coercion. The latter documents obligate the United States to consider an attack on the counterpart to be “dangerous to its own peace and safety” and to “act to meet the common danger.” (This same language was used in the 1954 defense treaty with Taiwan, which the United States abrogated in 1980.)\n\nThe Taiwan Relations Act, by contrast, sets a lower bar to initiate action by directing the president to consult Congress on a response to “any threat [emphasis added] to the security or the social or economic system of” Taiwan. Compared with a defense pact, the president can invoke the act earlier in a crisis—possibly even today.\n\nHaass and Sacks argue that strategic clarity should be accompanied by increased counter-China defense resources and enhanced diplomacy to signal severe economic and political costs in response to aggression. But the U.S. Defense Department has been focused on China as its top long-term priority since early 2018, and the recent implementation of U.S. and allied sanctions on Russia has instructed Beijing more than diplomacy ever could.\n\nTo build on this credibility, the United States must demonstrate willingness to sanction and restrict entities in China whenever appropriate—even at a cost to shorter-term U.S. economic interests. For their part, Edelman and Miller go further, suggesting that the United States deploy forces to Taiwan to train the Taiwanese military. Given revelations that U.S. force rotations to Taiwan already exist, though, no new policy declaration is needed to publicize or expand these programs.\n\nPutin’s trampling of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Ukraine and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s evisceration of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong indicate both leaders respect hard power, not words on paper. It is concrete actions—increased military resources to counter China, demonstrated willingness to enact sanctions, and deployments of U.S. forces in Taiwan—that have and will impact Beijing’s perceptions of U.S. capability and resolve. Such actions can be taken without a U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan.\n\nConversely, a declaration of strategic clarity could instead be counterproductive. A U.S. security guarantee would necessarily come with two caveats or conditions. The first relates to geographic scope. The Taiwan Relations Act (like the mutual defense treaty that preceded it) covers the main island and the nearby Penghu islets, leaving out Taiwan’s outer islands, which include offshore islands along China’s coast and South China Sea features.\n\nWith very little warning, the Chinese military could annex one or more of these isles in a matter of hours—presenting a fait accompli before the United States could respond. And with China’s unparalleled anti-access defenses, not even the U.S. Marines would attempt to reclaim islands within China’s coastal territories. Therefore, a U.S. security guarantee cannot credibly include these outlying islands.\n\nBut even if they are not covered under a defense pact, by annexing them Beijing would diminish U.S. credibility and sow division in Taiwan, just as it has in the Philippines, a longtime U.S. treaty ally.\n\nTen years ago, Beijing ran such a playbook in the South China Sea , leveraging its superior maritime power. China’s armed vessels escalated a jurisdictional fishing dispute at the Philippines-controlled Scarborough Shoal, which China also claims and which is technically not covered by the U.S.-Philippines defense treaty. Washington stepped in to mediate, but Beijing reportedly reneged on an agreement for both claimants to withdraw. Following the Philippines’ withdrawal, the United States did not challenge China’s remaining vessels, effectively ceding control of the shoal to China.\n\nIn the decade following this incident, many in the Philippines, including its president, have expressed resignation to China’s regional dominance and questioned the credibility of the U.S.-Philippines defense pact. Furthermore, the Philippines government delayed key U.S. security cooperation programs that would have enhanced allied deterrence posture vis-à-vis China. Given how Beijing’s 2012 aggression undermined the U.S.-Philippines alliance in Manila, if Washington were to adopt strategic clarity for Taiwan, Beijing might be incentivized to attempt a similar gambit with Taipei by seizing one of its outlying islands.\n\nA second condition of strategic clarity would be a “no Taiwan independence” clause, wherein a U.S. pledge “to come to Taiwan’s aid [would not be] unconditional and would not necessarily cover a crisis initiated by Taipei,” as Haass and Sacks write. But the assignment of blame for initiating a conflict is in the eye of the beholder. Such a caveat would be welcomed by Beijing, which argues that all its coercive measures are in response to provocations by Taipei and Washington. In Beijing’s view, Washington threatens China’s sovereignty by encouraging Taiwan along its steady march toward independence.\n\nWith Ukraine, Chinese officials and media adopted Russia’s narrative that the United States is to blame for having broken a purported promise to not expand NATO eastward. In this reading, Putin was forced to invade Ukraine to block NATO from reaching Russia’s doorstep. Beijing also claims that Washington is acting equally as dangerously in the Indo-Pacific—so presumably Xi will be compelled to prevent Taiwanese independence.\n\nConsidering Taipei’s assertions that Taiwan is “an independent country already,” a conditional U.S. promise to intervene would only provide fodder for China’s global propaganda organs, casting the United States as again reneging on a commitment not to interfere in China’s internal affairs. In practice, the “no independence” condition removes clarity from strategic clarity and enhances China’s propaganda narratives.\n\nLike most Americans, many Taiwanese people naively assume that the U.S. military can save them from subjugation. In truth, however, Taiwan’s inherent capacity to resist an invasion until partners can come to its aid is likely a decisive factor in mounting a successful defense, and therefore in deterring an attack in the first place.\n\nAccording to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), “Taiwan faces significant challenges from decades of underinvestment in defense.” In 2020, Taiwan spent just under 2 percent of its GDP on its military, while many other so-called front-line democracies, including South Korea, India, the Baltic states, Poland, and Israel, all spent more than 2 percent. While Taiwan’s defense budget has inched upward in recent years, a U.S. security guarantee would be counterproductive to overall military deterrence, because it would reduce pressure on the Taiwanese government to further increase defense spending, marginalizing effective capability enhancements such as additional defensive munitions and drones.\n\nLastly, the argument for strategic clarity is premised on the notion that China currently believes the United States will not intervene militarily to defend Taiwan. While Beijing’s propaganda denigrates Washington’s commitment to the region, there is scant evidence that China’s leaders actually believe it. The Chinese Communist Party’s internal doctrine frames the United States as China’s greatest threat , and China’s military likewise assumes U.S. intervention in its planning. In China, U.S. President Joe Biden’s invocations of a commitment to defend Taiwan are viewed as intentional signaling, not as unscripted commentary. As the USCC concluded, “The perceived lack of clarity … may be less relevant to deterrence failure than other factors … given that Chinese leaders already assume U.S. intervention.”\n\nThe instinct to provide a security guarantee to Taiwan arises from deeply held American values. But U.S. adversaries hold different values and are swayed by alternative propositions. Beijing would likely exploit a declaration of strategic clarity and seek to create divisions between Washington and Taipei.\n\nFrom China’s point of view, a decision to invade Taiwan would not be tied to a U.S. security guarantee—Beijing already assumes that Washington will intervene. To enhance military deterrence, Washington must advance credible U.S., Taiwanese, and allied defense postures and capabilities. To increase economic and political deterrence, the United States must demonstrate willingness to hold China accountable and build coalitions to do the same. Given the high stakes, Washington must lead from the front without delay to effectively deter cross-strait aggression.', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/taiwan-military-air-force-defense-GettyImages-1239656630.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:52'}

The Solomons was the seventh country to cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan under President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) administration, leaving it with just four diplomatic allies in the Pacific region.\n\nHowever, last month, a secret draft security agreement between the Solomon Islands and China was leaked onto social media, indicating that there might be more to Beijing’s wooing of the Solomons than initially met the eye that could have profound implications for the security of not just Taiwan, but the entire region.\n\nWhile the final version of the agreement remains unknown — Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has refused requests by opposition politicians to make the document public — the leaked draft allows China to send police and armed forces to “protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects” on the islands. The draft agreement also permits visits by Chinese vessels to replenish supplies, and contains a provision for the Solomon Islands government to request assistance from Chinese police or soldiers to maintain social order.\n\nSogavare has strenuously denied that there is any plan to allow China to construct a military base on the islands. Beijing’s foreign influence operations across Asia and Africa follows a well-rehearsed modus operandi. Commercial interests are gradually ramped up in the target nation until economic dependency is achieved, while political influence is nurtured through bribery and corruption. Elite capture combined with economic capture eventually turns the target nation into a debt-fueled supplicant, giving Beijing free rein to make whatever demands it likes — including the imposition of a military base.\n\nFollowing the leak, the reaction in Washington and Canberra was somewhat muted, indicating that both nations were confident they could dissuade Sogavare from inking a deal with Beijing. This all changed on Tuesday last week, when the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at a regular news conference that the deal had been signed — just days before a US diplomatic delegation was due to arrive in the Solomons for high-level talks.\n\nBeijing has pulled off a major strategic coup on a par with last year’s AUKUS agreement between Australia, the UK and the US. It is a vivid demonstration of a new “great game” between the US and China unfolding, as each power seeks to gain a dominant strategic foothold in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe Solomon Islands’ strategic importance rests on the island of Tulagi, which is home to a deepwater harbor ideally suited to large warships. Tulagi served as a naval base for first British, and then Japanese forces during World War II. Japan sought control of the naval base, as it would have allowed Tokyo to control and disrupt vital shipping and communication lanes that connect North America with Australia and Asia. Beijing appears to be set on succeeding where Japan failed, albeit through more subtle means.\n\nThe establishment of a permanent naval base on Tulagi would have a direct impact on Taiwan’s security by allowing China to bypass the first island chain, and disrupt vital shipping and supply lines to Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan has joined other nations in voicing concern over the agreement, with Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) saying the deal “undermines the ‘status quo’ and the supply lines of democratic allies.”\n\nThere is significant unease among Solomon Islanders over their government’s closeness to China, which last year boiled over into riots. This provides an opening.

It is believed that if you are suddenly confronted with a request and are unable to meet it, you and the other party could both be shamed. As U.S. anthropologist Ruth Benedict explained in her 1946 book “The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,” there is a “culture of shame” in Japan.\n\nIn actuality, Zelenskyy’s speech did not contain any requests that would be difficult for the Japanese government to implement. Kishida immediately followed Zelenskyy’s speech with an announcement of additional humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. One Cabinet member expressed relief, stating, “I thought we would be embarrassed if they made demands that Japan could not comply with, such as providing weapons.” A senior Foreign Ministry official also said, “I am glad that Ukraine did not make a request for aid in arms.” This is indeed the reality in Japanese politics.\n\nDuring a press conference at the Japan National Press Club on April 1, Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Korsunsky explained why Ukraine threw a softball when it came to Japan. The words in the speech were “very carefully chosen,” he said. He added that Ukraine of course knows about Article 9. Zelenskyy’s speech had given consideration to the Japanese political situation indeed, embodying the world’s expectations of Japan today and highlighting its limitations.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Japan’s security policy is constrained. Article 9 of the Constitution — the one Garcia said gave him hope for the future development of ties between Japan and the Philippines — prescribes the “renunciation of war,” the prohibition of “war potential,” and the denial of “the right of belligerency of the state.” The current Constitution does not give legal grounds for the type of military assistance requested by Ukraine of Western countries. Following the crisis in Ukraine, the Japanese government hastily revised the operational guidelines of the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and provided bulletproof vests to Ukraine — but full-scale arms transfers are still not legally permissible. The reality is that “this is the limit of what Japan can do at this point,” according to Japanese government officials and politicians.\n\nIn lieu of full-scale military assistance, the Japanese government has joined other G7 nations in imposing economic sanctions on Russia. Japan has also provided humanitarian assistance, including dispatching Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi to Poland to bring 20 evacuees from Ukraine to Japan on a government plane. This should be commended.\n\nYet the question remains whether Japan should stay as it is. In post-World War II Japan, the argument in support of maintaining Article 9 of the Constitution as a means to protect the country has been made, mainly by liberals. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought home to many in Japan the reality that, even with the establishment of the current international order supported by international laws, a country can unilaterally attempt to challenge the status quo by using its military force.\n\nThe Far East has many red lines. China is a neighbor that exerts military pressure on others in the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea and the South China Sea through its military power. North Korea has been extending the range of its ballistic missiles with the aim of acquiring the capability to break through the Japanese and U.S. missile defense systems. Japan arguably faces its most severe security environment since World War II.\n\nThe state of national defense should be a focus of the House of Councillors elections coming in July. We must debate how to strengthen deterrence amid growing security concerns. In this era of massive change, it is important to return to the Constitution to tackle fundamental issues. Public debate must be deepened from a broad perspective because the world will never go back to the way it was before the Ukraine war.\n\nBy Yuko Mukai\n\nAsia News Network: The Nation (Thailand), The Korea Herald, The Straits Times (Singapore), China Daily, Jakarta Post, The Star and Sin Chew Daily (Malaysia), The Statesman (India), Philippine Daily Inquirer, Yomiuri Shimbun and The Japan News, Gogo Mongolia, Dawn (Pakistan), The Island (Sri Lanka), Kuensel (Bhutan), Kathmandu Post (Nepal), Daily Star (Bangladesh), Eleven Media (Myanmar), the Phnom Penh Post and Rasmei Kampuchea (Cambodia), The Borneo Bulletin (Brunei), Vietnam News, and Vientiane Times (Laos).', 'image': 'https://media.nationthailand.com/uploads/images/md/2022/04/NjCR9LDn62a2PtadS2Nk.webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:17'}

Photo: @Ukraine via Twitter\n\nTOKYO — The Ukrainian government has apologized for tweeting a video featuring a picture of Japan’s wartime emperor, Hirohito, alongside Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, renewing a debate on the Japanese monarch’s responsibility for the country’s World War II atrocities.\n\nUkraine’s official account deleted the video on Sunday and said it had “no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan” following a protest by the Japanese government. A senior Japanese official on Monday called the now-deleted video, which was posted on April 1, “inappropriate and extremely regrettable.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe video was meant to be a social media campaign condemning fascism and the Russian invasion of its neighbor, for which Japan has sanctioned Moscow.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has deleted the original tweet and posted a new version of the video without any Japanese figure, but the removal has ignited a debate about whether it was wrong to compare fascist leaders to Japan’s wartime emperor, who was head of state during Japan’s imperial expansion and militarization.\n\nEmperor Shōwa, widely known as Hirohito, ruled Japan from 1926 until his death in 1989, including the period from the invasion of China in 1937 to the end of WWII in 1945 when Japanese soldiers killed 3–10 million people. But some historians and officials argue that he was a mere figurehead and lacked real power, thus void of responsibility for the country’s actions.\n\nMasahisa Sato, the head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s foreign policy panel, tweeted that he urged the Japanese foreign ministry to protest the video posted on Ukraine’s official account. “Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affair needs to get it together and do a better job” in preventing such videos, he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian embassy in Japan also distanced themselves from the original Ukrainian tweet, saying that the creators of the video lacked “historical awareness.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut others have disagreed and said it’s historically accurate to group the emperor with Hitler and Mussolini.\n\n“[The] Japanese feel uncomfortable with him being likened to Hitler and Mussolini, two dictators, as they find the then prime minister, Tojo Hideki, more similar image-wise” to the German and Italian leaders, Akira Yamada, a professor at Meiji University who studies Japanese modern history and its imperial system, told VICE World News.\n\n“But he was the head of state, so from an international and legal standpoint, it isn’t wrong to place him side by side,” he said.\n\nYamada argued that it is wrong, as many loyalists do, to absolve Hirohito of Japan’s wartime atrocities by claiming he didn’t know the full extent of Japanese militarism.\n\n“He was the only one in Japan who had complete power over the army and navy—he was well aware of what was happening, but believed it couldn’t be helped because they were in the midst of war,” he said.\n\nDuring WWII, Japan invaded China as part of its plans for imperial expansion and search for natural resources. At the beginning of this invasion, Japan also carried out mass killing and ravaging of Chinese civilians—now known as the Rape of Nanking—over a six-week period. By the time the war ended, China had suffered 15 million deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Japan’s occupied territories, which include South Korea and the Philippines, the Imperial Japanese Army also forced women and girls into sexual slavery and euphemistically called them “comfort women.”\n\nUnlike other Japanese officials, Hirohito was exempted from prosecution of war crimes following Japan’s defeat. Later documents would also show how he had wanted in 1952 to express regret and remorse for Japan’s actions during WWII, but was stopped by the prime minister at the time.\n\nThe Japanese narrative around Hirohito’s culpability—or the lack thereof—was shaped also by the U.S.-led forces that occupied Japan following the war, which sought to preserve Japan’s national identity, said Yusuke Suzumura, an associate professor of political history at Meijo University.\n\n“After the war, the Allied forces kept Japan’s imperial system because they understood how devastating it’d be for the Japanese people if he were gone,” he told VICE World News.\n\n“So many people in Japan learn that the former emperor was a figurehead, though he signed the papers allowing Japan to go to war,” he said.\n\nYamada at Meiji University also said that both Japanese and U.S. officials avoided blaming Hirohito for wartime atrocities because it would dishearten Japanese citizens. “Throughout the war, the Japanese people were taught that they had to sacrifice their lives for the emperor, so then to claim that he was wrong or he committed wrongdoings would mean all their sacrifices would be wasted,” he said.\n\nAfter the official Ukrainian Twitter account deleted the video, the Japanese government accepted Ukraine’s apology and reassured the nation of its continued support in its war with Russia.\n\nJapan has been staunchly supporting Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an attack in late February. It has imposed sanctions on Russia and sent non-lethal weapons to Ukraine, in a break from its usual pacifist stance.\n\nIt’s also offered nonpermanent refugee status to over 680 Ukrainians as of Saturday, despite taking a traditionally sparing approach to asylum seekers.

Although he leads South Korea’s most prestigious university, an institution largely cushioned from the existential crisis threatening to engulf much of the country’s higher education sector, he is deeply worried about the future of the nation’s other institutions.\n\n“Of course we enjoy recognition and prestige, but also a heavier expectation and sense of responsibility are laid upon us,” the president of Seoul National University (SNU) tells Times Higher Education in the latest in our Talking Leadership series.\n\nA report published late last year predicted that nearly half of South Korea’s 385 universities could close in the next quarter-century. Oh believes that the situation could be even more dire. Based on projections of student cohorts, “in 20 years from now, only about 40 universities the size of SNU are necessary”, he says.\n\nSome institutions are already failing to admit enough students to continue to be viable, and it’s a particular problem for certain areas of the country, he says. The capital, Seoul, and its surrounding region are home to more than 50 per cent of the population, and an even higher percentage of the younger generation. It is the rural universities that cannot attract enough students, “so they may collapse in a few years”, Oh adds.\n\nHe worries about the knock-on effect of closures on local economies and communities: “If the university is closed, the local community is also at risk. In the end, it really breaks down the whole ecosystem of the universities and also the national economy. So it’s a big problem.”\n\nOh thinks the solution lies in strengthening rural universities so that they attract students and fortify local economies. “If they become stronger in research capability, they can create jobs by making start-ups and collaborating with local industries,” he says.\n\nSNU is working to improve these universities by providing exchange programmes that allow their students to spend a semester or a year at SNU. During Covid, they were forced online, but the institution hopes to return to in-person exchanges soon.\n\nThe other solution, Oh says, is to emphasise lifelong learning. However, this will require a shift, he explains, because only 20 years ago universities were riding the wave of an abundance of young students and so did not invest in continuing education. The government also spends less on lifelong learning than other developed countries, he says. “We have to change the attitude of the government as well as the universities.”\n\nNext month, South Korea will have a new government; the conservative People Power Party candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, who won by a hair’s breadth, will take office. Oh hopes the government will recognise that strengthening rural universities will help the economy, although he says he is unsure of the new president’s stance because higher education was not a policy issue during the election campaign.\n\nThe weakening of other universities in South Korea presents a unique problem for Oh and SNU. Unlike in the US, for instance, where many prestigious universities specialise in certain subjects, SNU has to spread its net wide.\n\n“If we leave out one academic field, that field cannot really survive in our country,” Oh says.\n\nWhen he was a dean at SNU more than a decade ago, Oh invited 40 professors from other countries to assess the university, and a common comment was that it was spread too thin, considering the size of departments. The answer, according to Oh, again lies in the strengthening of other universities – “then we can share our burden with them”.\n\nPublishing bias\n\nAnother reason Oh wants all Korean universities to up their game is to combat bias in the publishing world. He spent several years in the US early in his career, and while at Stanford University he had no problem submitting papers to top journals. When he returned to South Korea and submitted what he thought was his best work so far, the paper was rejected with a comment suggesting that he read some of the fundamental research in his subject.\n\n“I had a feeling that this is really biased. I didn’t have that kind of comment when I was in the States. When I submitted a paper, nobody said you have to read all these classics,” he says.\n\nAlthough the incident took place 40 years ago, when South Korea’s research capability was less advanced, publishing bias is still a concern for Oh: “To be really competitive in the world market, all our institutions should become better. Otherwise, there will be prejudice against you.”\n\nOh studied at SNU himself, and he says he never wanted to do anything other than become an academic. After completing a PhD at Stanford and spending three years working in research labs in the US, he returned to SNU as a professor and taught for more than 30 years.\n\n“I thought quite a lot about whether I should stay in the States or go back to Korea. And what I realised was that if I stayed in the United States, I would live a comfortable life but I would just be one of them. But if I came back to Korea at the time, I could change the Korean academic society,” he says.\n\nCombating polarisation\n\nOne way he hopes to improve his country is by combating what he sees as a creeping polarisation.\n\n“Many beliefs are not based on objective facts,” he says. “[People] tend to listen to what they like only.”\n\nSNU’s offering is a newly minted Institute for Future Strategy – a multidisciplinary thinktank that will provide the public, and the government, with objective data and facts. The institute has five research themes, one of which is polarisation and the crisis in democracy.\n\nAlthough South Korea is democratic, and the recent general election saw an extremely high turnout, Oh says “people tend to go extreme”.\n\nHis faculty experience this problem with their students, and Oh sees it in even his own social circle.\n\n“When I talk to my friends, they are really polarised. They argue [with] each other. They cannot come to a consensus,” he says. “We have to try to understand the reasons and costs and try to see what we can do to lessen this problem.”\n\nThe new institute will also research the low birth rate and ageing population and the knock-on effect this has on society, as well as pandemics, and the future of science and technology. Another focus will be the changing world order.\n\nBecause of its geographical location, South Korea is “at the forefront of conflicts between the United States and Russia or China,” Oh says. “We are worried about the Soviet and US conflict. Korea is really in the middle, and so we have to worry about that and what to expect.”\n\nSouth Korea’s biggest trading partner is China, but it is aligned with the US militarily, he explains.\n\n“China doesn’t like what we do with the United States,” he says, adding that five years ago China stopped showing Korean films as an expression of dissatisfaction with South Korea.\n\nOn the topic of Korean cultural exports, what does Oh think about the brutally violent representation of his country portrayed in Netflix’s global hit Squid Game?\n\n“I feel that it shows some aspects of our society, Korean society, which is really too competitive in every aspect,” he says.\n\nOh believes that the country should be more collaborative instead: “We have to give second chances to many more people.” His work at SNU, and in strengthening the wider South Korean higher education system, might just do that.\n\nQuick facts\n\nBorn: Seoul, 1953\n\nAcademic qualifications: BSc in physics from Seoul National University; PhD in physics from Stanford University\n\nLives with: His wife; he has one daughter\n\nAcademic hero: German physicist Werner Heisenberg\n\nThis is part of our “Talking leadership” series of 50 interviews over 50 weeks with the people running the world’s top universities about how they solve common strategic issues and implement change.

It had been pre-signaled as early as 2021 and by a range of weapons tests this year.\n\nThe statement follows 13 tests of varied delivery systems this year. They include missile types appropriate for delivering nuclear warheads to battlefields, rather than the huge, and photogenic, intercontinental ballistic missiles that heft strategic nuclear warheads into the atmosphere.\n\nNorth Korea’s leader also made clear his intent to continue developing his nuclear arsenal – an intention widely repeated in headlines. But that is classic, often-repeated Kim-talk.\n\nConversely, Kim’s statement on the expanded role of his nuclear force overturns years of conventional wisdom.\n\nA North Korean ballistic missile. Photo: WikiCommons\n\nEmerging offensive stance\n\nEver since 2006, when North Korea first tested a nuclear device, the broad understanding among analysts and observers has been that North Korea’s nuclear arsenal exists to deter an Iraq- or Afghanistan-style attack by nuclear-armed US forces.\n\nSome say the possession of nuclear arms also gives North Korea a stronger voice in its dealings with China. But the bottom line is that they underwrite the North Korean state and the Kim regime.\n\nOf late, cracks have appeared in this long-held belief.\n\nAs previously reported in Asia Times, North Korea has been gradually shifting toward weapons of use, rather than weapons of non-use. And this year, it has likely taken note of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent practice.\n\nPutin has verbally ring-fenced his conventional invasion of Ukraine by threatening nuclear retaliation against any outside states which dare to intervene.\n\nCould that strategy be replicated on the Korean Peninsula? That is unknown. But while Kim is talking a good game, it is not clear that he has the capabilities in place to put it into practice. At least, not yet.\n\nKim has not tested a nuclear device since 2017. And all devices tested so far have ignited the kind of kilotonnes required for city-shattering strategic weapons.\n\nBut at a 2021 Party Congress, Kim announced a vast new list of weapons, including tactical nuclear arms. Such weapons, with smaller yields, are designed for use on the battlefield, often not simply to destroy, but to deny an area to an enemy. It is known as “grid square removal.”\n\n“We are talking a small nuclear weapon that is useful for military targets, missile bases, but also assembly areas, airfields and harbors,” Chun In-bum, a retired South Korean general, told Asia Times.\n\nOminously for South Korea’s defense, US forces would require that kind of facility to reinforce the peninsula if hostilities broke out.\n\nNow reports are circulating about new tunneling at North Korea’s underground nuclear test site at Punggye-ri. This activity could suggest an upcoming test.\n\nEven before Kim’s announcement on Tuesday, there was little doubt he was developing tactical atomic arms.\n\nIn January, Kim tested a hypersonic missile, a weapon US and South Korean missile defenses cannot counter. That would be an appropriate delivery vehicle for a tactical nuke.\n\nIn April, Kim personally attended the test of a “new-type tactical guided weapon” that could upgrade “efficiency in the operation of tactical nukes,” the North’s official media reported.\n\nStill, if Pyongyang is to expand its nuclear forces from the strategic to the tactical level, it will require significant organization. Artillery units, rather than simply strategic rocket forces, will have to gain access to atomic weapon stockpiles, undertake new training and be incorporated in command-and-control nets.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un points to a device with the characteristic two-hemisphere peanut shape of a fusion bomb in an image released by North Korean state media in 2017. Officials in Pyongyang said the object was a hydrogen bomb. Photo: Korean Central News Agency / AGU\n\nWill Seoul go critical?\n\nNo tactical nuclear weapon has yet been used in war. In fact, there are multiple unknowns.\n\n“Nobody has been able to demonstrate the utility of nuclear weapons for compellence as opposed to deterrence,” said Daniel Pinkston, a US Air Force veteran and a professor of international relations at the Seoul-based Troy University.\n\n“If you deter, you are maintaining the status quo. If you compel, you are changing the status quo.”\n\nThe ongoing arming by North Korea may add punch to the arguments of those South Koreans who are pushing to go critical.\n\n“The only logical answer from the South Korean perspective is to have [US] nukes based on the peninsula, or for South Korea to have its own nuclear weapons,” Chun said. “That is where we are headed, in my view.”\n\nGiven the shakiness of the global non-proliferation regime, if Seoul goes down that path, pushback could be minimal.\n\nLike-minded nations are unlikely to take South Korea to task if it arms itself with nuclear weapons, one analyst told Seoul-based correspondents on Tuesday at a press conference on EU-South Korea relations.\n\n“Frankly, I don’t see any appetite to go tough on South Korea if they say, ‘We are going to develop nuclear weapons,’” said Ramon Pacheo Pardo, who teaches at the Brussels School of Governance and at King’s College London.\n\n“And the same with Japan and Taiwan. I don’t see the EU doing anything other than a statement of official condemnation.”\n\nRight-wing President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol speaks to foreign reporters in Seoul after winning a bitterly fought election. Photo: Asia Times / Andrew Salmon\n\nA change of direction?\n\nOngoing weapons testing by North Korea, and the imminent arrival in office of the Yoon Suk-yeol administration – which is conservative and more hawkish than the liberal Moon Jae-in administration, which made peaceful cross-border engagement a standout policy – could also accelerate alliance-building in the region.\n\nYoon, who takes power on May 10, has repeatedly said he wants to patch up ever-frayed relations with Japan. On Tuesday (April 26), high-profile members of his transition team were greeted in Tokyo by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nWhile details of that meeting are still scarce, Northeast Asia security was almost certainly an agenda item.\n\nBut overall, Pinkston does not believe that the balance of power has or will significantly change. His reasoning is based more on geography than strategy.\n\n“The Koreas don’t have the strategic depth or the landmass of Russia, China or the US,” he said. “Once the nuclear threshold has been crossed, North Korea does not have the strategic depth to absorb many nuclear strikes.”\n\nAs a result, he said, assured destruction remains viable.\n\n“The North Koreans are not jihadists or suicide bombers, they are rationalists. Look how long they have survived,” Pinkston said. “What is critical [for South Korea and its allies] is having the capability, and demonstrating the resolve, to deliver unacceptable punishment.”\n\nFollow Andrew Salmon on Twitter: @Andrewcsalmon', 'image': 'https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kim-Missile-copy.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:40'}

A long-time US treaty ally, the Northeast Asian nation has at the same time cultivated extremely cordial, if not at times subservient, relations with neighboring China, a top trading partner.\n\nDespite being a global economic dynamo and a leading military equipment exporter, South Korea has remained largely marginal in shaping the geopolitical landscape in its own Asian neighborhood.\n\nOutgoing President Moon Jae-in’s chief foreign policy focus, if not obsession, has been his largely ineffectual engagement with North Korea, which has shown little interest in actual disarmament and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nBut the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the election of new conservative leadership in Seoul could reset South Korea’s place in the broader Indo-Pacific geopolitical landscape.\n\nOn one hand, India’s commitment to maintaining robust ties with Russia has driven a wedge within the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue grouping, better known as the Quad, which brings the US, Japan, Australia and India under one China-focused security umbrella.\n\nDespite holding a cordial high-level meeting with top Indian officials earlier this month, the Biden administration has warned New Delhi against any efforts that could undermine the West’s sanctions against Russia.\n\nDuring their recent visit to Kiev, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made it clear that America’s current strategy is no less than full containment of Russia.\n\nTop Indian officials, meanwhile, have openly questioned both America’s moral ascendancy and the feasibility of reducing the South Asian country’s Russian arms and energy imports.\n\nUS President Joseph Biden has fired back by mentioning India’s “own problems” with human rights and democracy, while the Pentagon has indicated potential sanctions if New Delhi proceeds with the procurement of Russia’s advanced S-400 missile defense system.\n\nThe resurfacing of structural frictions in US-India relations has paved the way for the potential rise of alternative Quads in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force conducts Malabar 21 – an inter-nation exercise with the Indian Navy, US Navy and Royal Australian Navy – to improve tactical skills and further strengthen QUAD navies. Photo: AFP / EyePress News\n\nAs a vibrant democracy with a burgeoning industrial-military complex, South Korea is a key player in the broad US-led effort at preserving a rules-based order in the region. In the coming years, South Korea will likely seek a more prominent role in emerging “Quad Plus” and “G7 Plus” strategic groupings.\n\nIncoming South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has declared his willingness to “positively review joining” an expanded Quad, just as Korea becomes a regular guest in expanded G7 gatherings.\n\nTo be sure, India, Asia’s second-most populous nation, will likely remain as a major strategic focus for the West for the foreseeable future.\n\nDuring the fourth US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue earlier this month, Biden spoke with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and both sides vowed to pursue comprehensive strategic cooperation, dispelling certain speculation of a full-blown rupture in relations.\n\nIndia has also held high-level dialogue with other Western powers, including the United Kingdom, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently meeting Modi, as well as the European Union, with President Ursula Von der Leyen recently visiting New Delhi for the annual Raisina Dialogue as a chief guest.\n\nNevertheless, India’s structural tensions with the West aren’t going away anytime soon. India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has made it clear that India would maintain its robust defense relations with Russia as a matter of national security.\n\nIndian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has echoed a similar statement, arguing “India’s approach should be guided by our national beliefs and values, by our national interest, and by our national strategy.”\n\nEarlier, the outspoken Indian diplomat pushed back against statements by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who raised concern over “a rise in human rights abuses” in India.\n\nIn response, Jaishankar declared “India has its own problems” vis-à-vis the human rights situation in the US, especially amid the spike in anti-Asian racism. He also lashed out at US-based groups’ criticism of India’s democratic regression under the Modi regime.\n\nA close relationship based on strategic needs.

It calls for clarity and boldness, and for a commitment to principles,” argued Korea’s president-elect Yoon Suk-Yeol just a month before his election.\n\nDescribing his country as a “global pivotal state,” the incoming Korean leader has vowed to help like-minded powers, especially the US, jointly advance “freedom, peace, and prosperity through liberal democratic values and substantial cooperation.”\n\nIn a clear rebuke of outgoing president Moon, he made it clear that while “[d]ealing with North Korea is an important task for any South Korean government…it should not represent the whole of Seoul’s diplomacy.”\n\nCrucially, the incoming Korean president has rebuked his predecessor’s “reluctance to take a firm stand on a number of issues that have roiled the relationship between Washington and Beijing,” thus creating “an impression that South Korea has been tilting toward China and away from its longtime ally, the United States.”\n\nInstead, the president-elect argues, his country should abandon “timidity” and its “conspicuously silent” stance vis-à-vis authoritarian powers in favor of “a leadership role” on key international issues, including climate change and Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nYoon has indicated his preference for hosting advanced American weaponry, including the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, to enhance his country’s deterrence capabilities.\n\nPresident-elect Yoon Suk-yeol has very different ideas about regional military issues than his predecessor. Photo: Tasnim News Agency\n\nHe has also stated his commitment to a “new era of cooperation” with China, which is based on mutual respect rather than subservience. The values-based, Sino-skeptic foreign policy position of South Korea’s incoming president is highly consequential, precisely because of the Asian country’s stealthy emergence as a major player in global defense markets.\n\nSouth Korea not only hosts large US bases and weapons systems, but it also boasts massive armed forces with a $46 billion budget and a world-class defense export industry. The country’s defense exports reached a record-high of $7 billion last year, a figure that is expected to rise to $10 billion this year.\n\nKorea’s defense industry powerhouses of LIG Nex1 Co., Hanwha and Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. (KAI) have secured major contracts with a broad network of clients from Europe to the Middle East to Australia.\n\nCombining high-tech with favorable prices and terms of payment, Korea has rapidly emerged as a favorite defense and strategic partner among Southeast Asian countries, too.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Korea is the 7th largest supplier of defense equipment in the region. In particular, South Korea has “supplied 2 submarines, 5 AALS and 16 trainer/combat aircraft to Indonesia, 12 combat aircraft to the Philippines, and 1 frigate and 4 trainer/combat aircraft to Thailand.”\n\nAfter a few false starts, South Korea’s defense industry picked up steam in the early-2010s, when the country finalized a $400 million FA-50 fighter jet (the combat variant of the T-50) deal with the Philippines.\n\nSoon, other tactical weapons followed, with Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering selling six Chang Bogo-class diesel-electric attack submarines to Indonesia, and Hyundai Heavy Industries selling two Jose Rizal-class frigates to the Philippines. Aside from the Philippines, South Korea also successfully sold T-50 jet trainers to Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nThe crown jewel of South Korea’s burgeoning defense industry is the much-vaunted 4.5 generation fighter, the KF-2, a joint venture between Seoul and Jakarta, which holds a 20% stake in the $5.2 billion project. Up to 65% of the KF-21 critical technology and equipment are homegrown, cementing South Korea’s position in an exclusive club of nations capable of producing state-of-the-art fighter jets.\n\nAnother highly successful Korean export has been Hanwha’s K9 self-propelled gun. This 155mm, armored howitzer has been sold to multiple NATO nations including Estonia, Finland, Norway, Poland and Turkey, as well as Australia.\n\nIn many ways, South Korea is reaping the benefits of long-term investments in science and technology, having spent more on research and development as a percentage of its GDP than almost all Western countries. South Korea’s defense industry has also benefited from generous government support and high-tech cooperation with Western partners.\n\n“A new era of independent defense has begun, and it’s a historic milestone in the development of the [South Korean] aviation industry,” said President Moon during the public unveiling of the KF-21, nicknamed Boramae (“young hawk trained for hunting”), project last year at the Korea Aerospace Industries in Sacheon, South Gyeongsang province.\n\nThe Asian power is expected to complete as many as nine prototypes before the end of this year, with as many as 40 jets expected to be deployed by 2028 and 120 by 2032.

Russia, in an attempt to recover from an initially bungled invasion of Ukraine, is making nuclear threats to try to attenuate U.S. and Western assistance to that nation. Thus, the thinking is that China or North Korea might also rely on such weapons to try to similarly shield an aggressive invasion of a non-nuclear country in East Asia.\n\nA recent poll in South Korea showed more than 70 percent of South Koreans support their government getting nuclear weapons. Although South Korea has a very good conventional military by world standards, much better than its arch-rival North Korea, the North Koreans have nuclear weapons. Pressure is building in South Korea to obtain nuclear weapons because of fears that the United States’ “extended deterrence” (using its nuclear weapons to protect its ally South Korea) might be unreliable if North Korea invaded South Korea.\n\nAs it gets longer range missiles to deliver nuclear weapons, North Korea could invade South Korea and threaten the United States’ cities and military bases in the Pacific with nuclear holocaust if it came to the South’s assistance. Stupidly, during the debate in South Korea about whether to make a drive for nuclear weapons, North Korea warned that it would use its nuclear arsenal “at the outset of war” with the South. Also in South Korea’s neighborhood, China and Russia also have nuclear weapons and could possibly turn unfriendly.\n\nHowever, the U.S. government fears that if South Korea built nuclear weapons, any hope of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula would evaporate. In addition, the United States is apprehensive that a nuclear South Korea could start a nuclear arms race in the East Asian region.\n\nTaiwan, nervous about an attack from an increasingly nationalist China and without the mutual defense treaty South Korea has with the United States, likely is thinking similar thoughts as the South Koreans. And maybe even the more pacifist Japan—which has a mutual defense treaty with the United States, but also has difficult relations with China, Russia, North Korea, and even South Korea—might be having nuclear daydreams.\n\nInstead of obtaining nuclear weapons, at least one senior South Korean official has proposed enhancing extended deterrence by the United States reaching a nuclear-sharing agreement with South Korea similar to the one enjoyed by NATO nations. Under such an arrangement, if a war broke out, South Korean aircraft would be allowed to carry U.S. nuclear weapons.\n\nThis proposal is the wrong way to go. The United States should learn the right lesson from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, not the wrong one. It is true that Ukraine was invaded because it was not a member of NATO. However, despite the awful nature of the aggressive and heinous Russian invasion, at the end of the day, Ukraine is not strategically vital to the United States, and President Joe Biden, despite President Volodymyr Zelensky’s valiant and understandable effort to shame America into doing more to help him, has no obligation to do so.\n\nThe United States, now $30 trillion in debt, foolishly has assumed the burden of defending relatively wealthy far-forward states near Russia—for example, Poland, Romania, and the Baltics—and in East Asia, especially South Korea, Japan, and informally Taiwan. Whenever a severe security crisis occurs, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, all such states make it known they are nervous that U.S. extended deterrence will not hold. These states, and others in Pax Americana, should be apprehensive, because when war with any nuclear power is afoot, would the United States sacrifice Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago to save Seoul, Tokyo, and Taipei?\n\nIn a time when the financially strapped United States should be thinking about a more modest security posture in the world, it should allow South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan to arm themselves with nuclear weapons. The arms race did not start with them, it started with the pariah state North Korea getting nuclear weapons. The U.S. fantasy of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula has long been a mirage because North Korea will never give up its growing nuclear arsenal.\n\nSouth Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have been responsible players in the international system for some time now and would likely be good stewards of nuclear weapons. However, the price for the United States allowing them to obtain such arms would be to abrogate all U.S. securi ty guarantees. In the longer term, after the Ukraine crisis has passed, the United States should even rethink defending NATO countries. The Russian military has already proven it is a hollow shell; Europe already has Britain and France, two countries with a nuclear deterrent to counter the Russian one; and the wealthy European Union had five times the GDP of Russia, even before recent Western economic sanctions have devastated it, thus allowing Europe to amply defend itself without a U.S. nuclear and conventional umbrella.\n\nIvan Eland is a senior fellow with the Independent Institute and author of War and the Rogue Presidency, about why and how NATO bears some responsibility for the impending crisis in Ukraine.', 'image': 'https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/shutterstock_1234726828-scaled-e1650900064418.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:32'}

The report covers all G20 nations, excluding Russia. *\n\nThe research shows that governments that advance the real-time modernization of their national payments infrastructure create a win-win situation for all stakeholders in the payments ecosystem: consumers and businesses benefit from fast, frictionless and hyper-connected payments services, financial institutions future-proof their business in a highly competitive environment by speeding up cloud-first and data-centric modernization, and national governments boost economic growth, reduce the size of their shadow economy and create a fairer financial system for all.\n\nHighlights Australia and New Zealand\n\nAustralia:\n\nReal-time payments in Australia account for only 5.5% of total payments transaction volume with growth hindered by the country\'s strong reliance and preference for card-based schemes.\n\nIn 2021, Australia recorded 970 million real-time transactions resulting in estimated cost savings of $205 million for businesses and consumers in 2021 – which helped to unlock $US932 million of additional economic output, representing 0.06% of the country\'s GDP.\n\nWith real-time payments transaction numbers expected to rise to 2.4 billion in 2026 – net savings for consumers and businesses are forecast to climb to US$ 628 million, helping to generate an additional US$1.4 billion of economic output, equivalent to 0.07% of the country\'s forecasted GDP.\n\nNew Zealand:\n\nNew Zealand currently has no formal real-time payments scheme. Electronic payments dominate the country\'s payment space, occupying 59% of the total payments volume in 2021.\n\nCovid identified and magnified gaps in the country\'s payment infrastructure. In response, Payments New Zealand, the standards body set up by the leading banks, is coordinating the exploration of infrastructure options for the country\'s first real-time payments scheme\n\n"Australia and New Zealand have a terrific opportunity to close the gap on its regional rivals and help re-energise its economies post COVID," said Chris Hill, Head of Pacific, ACI Worldwide. "The region has all the practical elements for global success but making up ground in a world with constantly developing infrastructure and services will require concerted action, commitment, and coordination across governments and industry to reap the full benefits."\n\n"Real-time transactions and growth forecasts continue to rise globally, with emerging countries like India leading the way and outpacing developed nations. Governments around the globe who enable real-time schemes are driving economic growth and prosperity by providing consumers and businesses with cheaper, faster, and more efficient payment methods," said Jeremy Wilmot, Chief Product Officer, ACI Worldwide.\n\n"By allowing for the transfer of money between parties within seconds rather than days, real-time payments improve overall market efficiencies in the economy," commented Owen Good, Head of Advisory, Centre for Economic and Business Research. "Real-time payments improve liquidity in the financial system and therefore function as a catalyst for economic growth. This is especially important for our fast-paced and digital-led gig economies. Workers are paid quickly, allowing them to better plan their finances. Businesses have more flexibility and reduce the need for burdensome cashflow management."\n\n"Developing nations continue to drive the majority of real-time volume gains, confirming the industry trend of the strongest growth coming from economies with minimal existing electronic payments infrastructure, and therefore heavier reliance on cash," said Sam Murrant, Lead Analyst, GlobalData.

The report covers all G20 nations, excluding Russia. *\n\nThe research shows that governments that advance the real-time modernization of their national payments infrastructure create a win-win situation for all stakeholders in the payments ecosystem: consumers and businesses benefit from fast, frictionless and hyper-connected payments services, financial institutions future-proof their business in a highly competitive environment by speeding up cloud-first and data-centric modernization, and national governments boost economic growth, reduce the size of their shadow economy and create a fairer financial system for all.\n\nIndia Highlights:\n\nIndia accounted for the largest number of real-time transactions in 2021 (48.6 billion) – almost threefold that of the closest challenger China (18 billion transactions in 2021) and almost seven times greater than the combined real-time payments volume of the world\'s leading economies – U.S., Canada, U.K., France and Germany (7.5 billion)\n\nThe widespread adoption of real-time payments resulted in estimated cost savings of $US12.6 billion for Indian businesses and consumers in 2021, which helped to unlock $US16.4 billion of economic output which represents 0.56% of the country\'s GDP.\n\nThe growing acceptance of UPI-based mobile payment apps and QR code payments among merchants, combined with the increased use of digital payments during the COVID-19 pandemic, helped real-time payments secure 31.3% of total payments transaction volume in 2021.\n\nWith consumers increasingly shifting from cash to mobile-based real-time payments, skipping payment cards, the real-time payments\' share of the total payments volume will rise to over 70% in 2026 – with net savings for businesses and consumers forecast to rise to $US92.4 billion in 2026, helping generate an additional $US45.9 billion of economic output, equivalent to 1.12% of the country\'s forecasted GDP.\n\n"India is the poster child for real-time payments and a shining example of how a coordinated, collective, nationwide effort can unlock huge economic and social potential," said Ankur Saxena, Head of South Asia, ACI Worldwide. "India’s craving for cash may be plummeting, but there is still a great deal more to do. It is time to accelerate our efforts and expand this impact beyond the top tier metropolitan areas and replicate our success for the benefit of the entire country.”\n\n“Real-time transactions and growth forecasts continue to rise globally, with emerging countries like India leading the way and outpacing developed nations. Governments around the globe that enable real-time schemes are driving economic growth and prosperity, by providing consumers and businesses with cheaper, faster and more efficient payment methods,” said Jeremy Wilmot, chief product officer, ACI Worldwide.\n\nWilmot added: "One of the big themes in this year\'s report is the cloud as the great enabler of real-time success and new, differentiated payments experiences. Within the financial services industry, we are still only scratching the surface of the cloud\'s potential. As other industries have already shown, and as this report confirms, it is increasingly clear that banks and financial institutions with designs on winning with payments in the real-time digital economy need to be cloud-first and data-centric."\n\n"By allowing for the transfer of money between parties within seconds rather than days, real-time payments improve overall market efficiencies in the economy," commented Owen Good, Head of Advisory, Centre for Economic and Business Research. "Real-time payments improve liquidity in the financial system and therefore function as a catalyst for economic growth. This is especially important for our fast-paced and digital-led gig economies. Workers are paid quickly, allowing them to better plan their finances. Businesses have more flexibility and reduce the need for burdensome cashflow management."\n\n"Developing nations continue to drive the majority of real-time volume gains, confirming the industry trend of the strongest growth coming from economies with minimal existing electronic payments infrastructure, and therefore heavier reliance on cash," said Sam Murrant, Lead Analyst, GlobalData. "Amid all this activity, mobile in its multiple forms will shape the trajectory of real-time payments for developing markets.

India and Australia had already signed an interim FTA last week and expected to enter into a full FTA by end of this year. India’s approach to resuming negotiations has a sense of urgency and a few rounds of discussion have already taken place. The United Kingdom has traditionally been a large trading partner for India while Australia is emerging as a promising destination.\n\nThis is a dramatic shift from India’s earlier approach to FTAs. After assuming power in 2014, the Modi government started reviewing India’s existing trade pacts. There was a widespread belief in the government that FTAs created significant economic losses by allowing subsidised foreign products and other unfair production advantages for foreign firms.\n\nAustralian trade matters to India because of its growing energy demands. India aspires to become a leader in energy-consuming industries such as information technology and electric vehicles. An FTA with Australia would allow India to meet its energy needs and export skilled professionals in IT, engineering and other services.\n\nAustralia also holds a crucial strategic position for India. An Australian FTA would offer the largest market to Indian businesses in the Pacific region. Initiatives such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative have brought the two countries closer than before. An FTA is an opportunity to further strengthen bilateral relations.\n\nIn the UK–India FTA, India wants to secure larger market access for its agricultural produce and increase exports in services such as IT, nursing, education and health care. India seeks reduced tariffs in labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather and jewellery, which have always found a large market in the United Kingdom. India also wants to secure a larger number of employment visas for its professionals in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe difference between the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the current negotiations lies in their foundations. Since RCEP is a plurilateral agreement, India had to negotiate with many diverse countries and held much less negotiating power compared to bilateral pacts.\n\nIndia already has a trade arrangement with ASEAN, which makes up most of RCEP’s participants, but its experience has not been very encouraging. China’s membership in RCEP was another concern since India fears Chinese businesses will destroy its domestic industry.\n\nWhat prompted India’s appetite for new trade agreements? India’s trade deficit reveals a widening gap between export and import figures as it grew from US$118.37 billion in 2014–15 to US$161.34 billion in 2019–20. India aims to become a US$5 trillion economy by 2025 and it cannot achieve this without strong support from the external sector. India aims to boost exports through FTAs to large markets that are performing below their potential, such as Australia.\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic shook the global economy as lockdowns shattered manufacturing plants and global supply chains. Companies started to weigh options to relocate their manufacturing facilities and economies realised the importance of integration. India was no exception.\n\nIndia’s FTA negotiations are also encouraged by the aim to reduce economic dependence on China. Australia is currently experiencing a trade dispute with China, which has restricted a number of Australian imports and threatened to expand the list. Similarly, the United Kingdom has felt the pinch of Brexit and also needs to diversify its export destinations.\n\nIndia’s renewed interest in FTAs should also be seen from a strategic perspective. India resumed negotiations with economies with which it has robust trade relations or a trade surplus. India’s strategic and diplomatic relations with these nations have significantly deepened during the last few years, especially as they all perceive China as a threat to global trade and domestic industry.\n\nGeopolitics as well as economics will play a vital role in defining India’s future trade partnerships. India and Australia are both part of the QUAD and conduct joint naval exercises in the Indian Ocean region. Australia is among select countries with which India has a 2+2 dialogue. Similarly, India is a key partner of the UK in defence and security and undertakes joint operation in many regions.\n\nLearning from past FTA experiences, India wants a much more comprehensive agreement with carefully negotiated terms that secure maximum benefits.\n\nThe Bharatiya Kisan Union, the largest association of Indian farmers, has already threatened to launch a protest against the proposed FTA with Australia. Such protests were one of the major domestic obstacles that prevented India from entering RCEP. Indian automobile manufacturers and wine sellers also plan to vehemently oppose the FTAs with Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nSwadeshi Jagran Manch, the economic wing of the Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has similar intentions. The RSS previously cautioned the government against the negative impact of FTAs and urged it to refrain from any trade deal. An FTA with Australia will face protests from the agricultural sector while the manufacturing sector will lead protests against the UK–India FTA.\n\nThe current domestic and global economic situation puts India in a favourable position to sign FTAs. Given that India’s appetite for trade liberalisation is supported by domestic industries and a strong government in power, policymakers are in a hurry to close the deal.\n\nRahul Nath Choudhury is a Research Fellow at the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA), New Delhi.

In a drive to strengthen the indigenous arms industry, 64 per cent of capital outlays in the 2021 Indian military budget were earmarked for acquisitions of domestically produced arms,” SIPRI said.\n\nAccording to the report, the increase in India’s expenditure forms part of an overall global increase in military expenditure, “as the internationally consolidated figure crossed the $2 trillion mark for the first time ever, owing to worldwide economic recovery following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic”.\n\nExports to Myanmar\n\nAnother SIPRI report released last month said although one of the most high-profile export deals that India inked this year is the $375 million — or Rs 2,872 crore — deal with the Philippines to export BrahMos supersonic missile, the biggest beneficiary of India’s defence exports in the last five years is Myanmar.\n\nAccording to SIPRI data on international arms transfer trends, roughly 50 per cent of India’s defence exports from 2017 to 2021 were to Myanmar, followed by Sri Lanka at 25 per cent, and Armenia at 11 per cent.\n\nHowever, India is only Myanmar’s third-biggest supplier, at 17 per cent, behind China and Russia at 36 and 27 per cent, respectively, the data showed.\n\nAt the same time, India reduced its arms imports while still remaining among the world’s biggest importers, SIPRI said.\n\n“Because of perceived growing threats from China and Pakistan and because of significant delays in the production of its own major arms, India has large-scale plans for arms imports,” SIPRI said in its report. “The drop in India’s arms imports is, therefore, probably a temporary result of its slow and complex procurement process as well as its shift in suppliers.”\n\n(Edited by Uttara Ramaswamy)\n\nAlso Read: Delivery of 2nd S-400 squadron from Russia set for 3-month delay due to war, simulators arrive', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/defence.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:22'}

While Aadhaar won’t be a perfect blueprint for every country, experts say its rollout offers lessons to anyone hoping to close the ID gap.\n\nControversy has surrounded Aadhaar since its inception. Initially, there were few policy regulations to protect users’ data, and although enrollment is supposed to be voluntary, critics say Aadhaar has become essential for participation in public and economic life.\n\nAs more nations consider developing their own digital biometric ID systems, India’s controversial Aadhaar program may offer lessons about balancing efficiency, privacy, and personal freedom.\n\nThe government introduced Aadhaar in 2009 as a centralized way to ensure every resident could easily access social and financial services. Users submit their iris scans, fingerprints, and photographs in exchange for a unique 12-digit identity number, which can then be used to set up bank accounts or claim food rations. Roughly 99% of Indian adults are enrolled in the system today.\n\nThe World Bank reports that up to a billion people globally have no form of identification, with the highest concentration in Africa and Asia. India’s solution? Create the world’s largest biometric ID system.\n\nMost governments have a way to identify citizens. In the United States, some argue Social Security numbers have become the de facto national ID. In China, citizens age 16 and up apply for a resident identity card. India has created the world’s largest biometric ID system.\n\nThe Unique Identification Authority of India announced in December that 1.3 billion people, or roughly 99% of Indian adults, were enrolled in Aadhaar, an ambitious digital ID program that is increasingly being utilized throughout all spheres of life. And as other nations consider implementing their own national digital ID systems, India may provide insights.\n\nWhat is Aadhaar and how does it work?\n\nWhy We Wrote This As more nations consider developing their own digital biometric ID systems, India’s controversial Aadhaar program may offer lessons about balancing efficiency, privacy, and personal freedom.\n\nThe government introduced Aadhaar, meaning “foundation,” in 2009 as a centralized way to ensure every resident had the means to easily establish their identity. This was especially promising for India’s rural poor people, many of whom struggled to access social and financial services because they didn’t have the proper documents.\n\nTo set up an Aadhaar profile, residents offer biometric data – specifically iris scans, fingerprints, and photographs – in exchange for a unique 12-digit identity number. The government stores that information in a database, which certain third-party services can access to confirm your identity when needed. Shortly after sign-up, users receive a physical Aadhaar card, though electronic versions are also available nowadays.\n\nIn addition to making tasks like opening bank accounts and obtaining SIM cards more convenient for Aadhaar users, this system also helps the government prevent identity duplication and other forms of fraud. In 2019, some 49% of India’s citizens used the Aadhaar card to access services such as pensions and food rations for the first time, according to the State of Aadhaar report. Yet controversy has surrounded Aadhaar since its inception.\n\nHow are concerns being addressed?\n\nWhen the cards were introduced, there were few policy regulations to protect citizens’ data, leading to a 2018 data leak that made Aadhaar data on 200 official government websites public. The system has since implemented tighter security practices, according to former Aadhaar engineer Sanjay Jain, including automatically wiping authentication data after six months.\n\nAlthough enrollment is voluntary, critics say Aadhaar has become essential for participation in public and economic life. For all the ways it makes government services more efficient, the ambitious and experimental system is also vulnerable to glitching, creating major problems for those it aims to serve. When access was denied due to issues with authentication, people lost out on food assistance and had trouble enrolling in school.\n\n“When the Aadhaar worked, it really helped people. When it didn’t, it really hurt people,” says Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum. India’s Supreme Court cited her research twice in a 2018 ruling that attempted to set guardrails on Aadhaar usage.\n\nStill, as the Aadhaar system grows and evolves, it’s often unclear how to access services without it, and recent efforts to tie Aadhaar to voter registration and income tax collection have rekindled debate over whether Aadhaar is truly “voluntary.”\n\nWhy does Aadhaar matter beyond India?\n\nThe World Bank reports that up to a billion people globally have no form of identification, with the highest concentration in Africa and Asia. Digital biometric ID systems are an increasingly attractive solution – especially to governments in developing countries – for their simplicity, relatively low cost, and promise of universal access.\n\nJoseph Atick, digital identity expert and co-founder of the ID4Africa conference, calls India “a laboratory for the rest of the world.”\n\n“The most successful feature of Aadhaar,” he said in a recent webinar, is “the fact that you have been able to enroll so many people in such a short period of time.”\n\nGet stories that\n\nempower and uplift daily. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nMany governments, including in nearby Malaysia and Sri Lanka, are looking to India for insight on how to build their own digital ID systems. While Aadhaar won’t be a perfect blueprint for every country, experts say its rollout offers lessons to anyone hoping to close the ID gap.\n\n“Aadhaar is seen as a model,” says Ms. Dixon. “It’s very, very important for people to have access to a just, fair, equitable ID.”', 'image': 'https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2022/04/0425-Explainer-AINDIAID.jpg?alias=standard_900x600', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:59:38'}

However, this does not show the whole picture of the China-India bilateral trade which is mutually beneficial and essential.The widened trade gap has solid reasons, including China\'s early recovery of production from the COVID-19 pandemic which boosted the country\'s exports with a growth of 21.2 percent in 2021, and the absolute advantages of Chinese producers which have left Indian importers few alternatives although New Delhi adopted a "disengaging" approach toward China in economic sectors in recent years.Some Indian politicians have been complaining about the "trade deficit" with China for years and are seeking to reduce the dependence on Chinese products by disrupting normal trade or even calling for boycotts against Chinese products.However, to find a trade balance with China is not the right path, and more importantly, it does not in line with the interest of ordinary Indian consumers and the overall growth of its industries. The imbalance is objectively driven by the differences in economic and trade structures between China and India.China is the largest manufacturing hub in the world with the soundest industrial conditions. From production capacity and scale to cost control, supply efficiency, and quality, Chinese producers have developed comprehensive advantages compared to others in many industries.Indian importers cannot find suitable alternatives both at home and overseas any time soon. However, growing Chinese imports are not a problem for India. In fact, from the perspective of the impact of bilateral trade on India\'s production and consumption, the current pattern of China-India trade actually favors India\'s development.For starters, by purchasing better quality Chinese products at more reasonable prices, India could save more of its foreign exchange reserves and improve its capital efficiency. Ordinary Indian consumers could also enjoy better products at lower prices.Moreover, India\'s large imports of machinery and electronics, as well as other intermediate goods from China, have also greatly facilitated India\'s exports to third countries. All these beneficial factors have been ignored by certain Indian forces when they complain about the trade gap between the two countries.As two large developing countries in the world, China and India both have large markets but are currently in different phases of industrialization. By taking advantage of the great complementarities between the two economies, both have great potential to promote cooperation in trade and other areas, which are naturally in line with India\'s own interest.Instead of seeking decoupling, India should enhance cooperation with China. For instance, by better connecting with China\'s industrial chain directly or by integrating into the regional value chain, India could take better advantage of its strengths and achieve a faster growth. Then, it could develop more products demanded by Chinese consumers and boost its overall exports to China.It is reasonable for India to seek to develop its domestic industries or a more balanced bilateral trade with others, but clearly disrupting normal trading activities will not work. It is time for certain anti-China forces in India to respect economic rules and stop politicizing economic activities. Only by enhancing cooperation with China could both sides benefit.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn', 'image': 'https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-11-06/e98a4448-017d-4467-973e-7ee43448bc93.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:59:24'}

Powering Australian growth for decades, communities in Gladstone in Queensland, the Hunter Valley in NSW and Victoria\'s Latrobe valley face a tough transition in a global economy intent on cutting carbon emissions. A tool devised by energy market analyst Tristan Edis weighs up various types of electricity generation and jobs created while they are built as some regions look to transition workers into new jobs. Replacing coal plants with rooftop solar plus batteries is the best way to create construction jobs, according to the report released on Tuesday by the Australian Conservation Foundation. "Clinging to fossil fuels makes climate change worse, creates fewer jobs and leads to higher electricity bills," foundation CEO Kelly O\'Shanassy said. "That is not what Australians want." The results are drawn from figures on jobs created to build coal plants at Tarong, Millmerran and Kogan Creek; Snowy Hydro\'s estimates for the proposed Kurri Kurri gas power plant; and data calculated by the University of Technology Sydney on the renewable energy sector. Solar farms are second and wind farms rank third. Replacing old coal plants with new coal is fourth in construction jobs, and new gas ranks last. Offshore wind projects, a future boon for Victoria and Tasmania in particular, are excluded from the model. Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor says closure without like-for-like replacement will increase power bills and risk blackouts. But the International Energy Agency says there can be no new coal, oil or gas projects if global warming is to be limited to 1.5C. "Government interference in the market is likely to dampen private investment and reliance on expensive gas will lock in climate pollution and push up electricity prices," the report says. The modelling found replacing Australia\'s biggest coal-fired power station Eraring, slated to close in 2025, with renewables would create thousands more construction jobs than replacing it with a gas plant. The tool can also be used to provide household comparisons. For example, if Australia chose to power one million homes with new rooftop solar systems using panels and batteries, it would create more than 26,000 construction jobs. But the equivalent power from new coal plants would create less than 4000 jobs and new gas just 652.

This includes record solar capacity installations of 13.9GW in a year. India’s total renewable energy capacity now stands at 110GW.On the other hand, coal power capacity additions hit rock bottom in FY 2021/22. Only 1.4GW of net new coal capacity was added during the year, taking total coal capacity to 211GW. A total of 4.4GW of gross new coal capacity was commissioned and 1.5GW of end-of-life coal capacity was retired (1.5GW of capacity was converted to behind-the-meter captive use).As India’s solar industry has been heavily dependent on imported modules from China and Chinese-owned companies operating in other Asian markets, the Indian government imposed duties to protect domestic industry. However, the duty had an upward impact on solar tariffs, which slowed down capacity commissioning.During the FY 2020/21 fiscal budget announcement, the Indian Ministry of Finance imposed a basic custom duty (BCD) of 40% on imported solar modules and 25% on solar cells from China effective April 2022, while the previously imposed safeguard duty ended in July 2021. Developers used this brief window to their advantage and improved cost competitiveness.Solar developers in India also enjoyed a “duty free” period of 8 months between August 2021 and March 2022 for solar cell and module imports from China and other Asian markets. Through timing their module imports the developers accelerated project commissioning.These duties have sought to protect the domestic solar module manufacturers, which have struggled to compete with the scale and technology of the Chinese manufacturers. The Government of India sees solar module manufacturing as a huge opportunity to create job opportunities while reducing import dependence, necessary for India’s energy needs.It carried out the first round of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, pegged at Rs 24,000 crore (US$3.2Bn), in February 2022. The scheme attracted industry giants such as Reliance, Adani and Shirdi Sai Electricals to set up a fully-integrated module manufacturing capacity of 12GW.India’s domestic cell manufacturing capacity is projected to be 33GW and for modules, 51GW by 2025 (JMK Research, IEEFA). This would potentially reverse the reliance on imports and create export capability for solar modules.The renewable energy sector attracted investments north of US$15bn in FY 2021/22, largely for generation assets. This includes green bonds worth US$4.7bn and debt worth US$1.8bn from domestic as well as foreign lenders.There is more than 50GW of renewables capacity currently under development including projects tendered, auctioned and under construction. Capacity commissioning of about 16GW is expected in FY2022/23 (ICRA).India’s giant target of 450GW by 2030 needs a capacity commissioning rate of, on average, 35-40GW annually going forward with annual investment of US$35-40Bn in generation, transmission and storage assets.There is 55GW of coal capacity in India’s pipeline (as of January 2022) according to Global Energy Monitor (GEM) data. Of this, 31GW is under construction and the remaining 24GW is in various stages of planning and regulatory approval.A staggering 607GW of planned coal power projects have been cancelled or shelved since 2010, according to GEM. And given the challenges, most current projects will not see the light of the day.Investors and lenders have turned their backs on coal power projects as lower-cost and clean renewable energy puts increasing pressure on coal plants’ bottom dollar.In the last five years, an average of 2.5GW of coal capacity has been retired annually, and the pace could pick up. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (CERC) (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulations, 2019, allows the beneficiary (distribution licensee) a right of first refusal to allow termination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with coal-fired power plants at the end of a 25-year period.In January 2022, the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity upheld the judgment of the CERC relating to the termination of a PPA older than 25 years between BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (distribution company) and NTPC’s Dadri-I thermal power station. CERC’s judgment is likely to accelerate the retirement of old coal plants because it sets a precedent for other distribution companies (Discoms) to exit end-of-tenure thermal PPAs.India has 42GW of coal power plants aged 25 years or older, and another 23GW turning 25 between now and 2032. That means around 65GW potentially reaching retirement age over the next decade. And these plants will have to contend with Discoms refusing to extend PPAs.In IEEFA’s view, India’s coal capacity expansion will possibly be limited to net 20GW, totalling ~230GW by the end of the decade.India’s Net Zero commitment by 2070 will require the achievement of near-term goals starting with the 2030 renewables target. Large corporates and industries are also looking to reduce their carbon footprint and increasingly opting for corporate renewable PPAs. Further, the government is looking to decarbonise other emission-intensive and hard-to-abate sectors which will increase the demand for renewable power.Financing will be a key challenge for building these large assets.A number of Indian renewable energy developers have successfully managed to access foreign equity and debt capital. But there is a larger pool of ESG and sustainability-linked funds available that could be accessed, such as through government-backed sovereign green bonds. For dollar-denominated green bonds, the currency risk adds to cost capital. The Indian renewables financing market also needs to access domestic capital. There is a scope to raise domestic capital through rupee-denominated green bonds to expand the pool of financing for renewables.', 'image': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-91073329,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-93991,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:47'}

This will squeeze already tight supplies of vegetable oils and add to the impact of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine that\'s thrown sunflower oil trade into chaos.\n\nWhile details are emerging that Indonesia\'s ban will exclude some products, it still risks stoking food inflation further. World food costs are at an all-time high and surging at the fastest pace ever. The ubiquitous use of edible oils in everything from candy to frying and fuel means that it could well be a thorn in the side of global food inflation for a long time to come.\n\nHere are the latest developments and their far-reaching impacts:\n\nGlobal Food Supply\n\nThe move by Indonesia, which accounts for a third of global edible oil exports, will add to turmoil facing emerging markets from Sri Lanka to Egypt and Tunisia. Even developed countries could see sharp rises in supermarket prices.\n\nPalm oil is one of the most versatile staples, used in thousands of products from food to personal care items to biofuels. Prices of cooking oils have been on a tear due to drought and labor shortages. Then the war in Ukraine roiled trade of about 80% of global sunflower oil exports, boosting demand for alternatives like palm and soybean oil and sending prices to record highs.\n\nIndonesia\'s ban applies to exports of RBD palm olein, a higher value product that has been processed. Exports of crude palm oil and RBD palm oil will still be allowed, according to people familiar with the matter. RBD olein accounts for 30% to 40% of Indonesia\'s total palm oil exports.\n\nThe move could increase costs for packaged food producers such as Nestle, Mondelez International and Unilever. Nestle declined to comment, while the other companies didn\'t respond to a request for comment. It may also force governments to choose between using vegetable oils for food or biofuels.\n\nIndia\n\nIndia, the world\'s biggest importer of palm, soybean and sunflower oils, faces a further spike in inflation. Domestic prices of the edible oils in New Delhi surged between 12% and 17% since the war in Ukraine erupted late February. The government has abolished import levies and is trying to clamp down on hoarding of cooking oil, but prices are showing little signs of cooling.\n\nIndonesia\'s move will hit costs and margins of several consumer companies, financial services firm Prabhudas Lilladher said. Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India and ITC Ltd. will be among those directly affected, and the impact will be felt most keenly in biscuits, noodles, cakes, potato chips and frozen desserts.\n\n"If this ban is seriously implemented, it can be highly inflationary," said Atul Chaturvedi, president of the Solvent Extractors\' Association of India. Demand will probably shift, but the availability of other edible oils is also limited.\n\nIndians prefer palm over other oils because it\'s cheaper and can be blended easily with other fats. It also lasts longer than other alternatives, making it cost-efficient for bulk users such as restaurants and hotels. Cooking oils play a starring role in feasts served during the country\'s massive festivals.\n\nChina\n\nChina is another big importer of Indonesian cooking oil. It bought 4.7 million tons of palm oil from the Southeast Asian nation last year, accounting for more than 70% of total imports. China\'s purchases have slumped this year on higher prices and as strict Covid lockdowns hurt demand.\n\nCompared with palm, China is more dependent on imported soybean, which produces both oil for cooking and meal for animal feed to support the diets of its 1.4 billion population.\n\nThe export ban by Indonesia adds to headwinds for the Chinese government looking to keep inflation under control. While consumer inflation has remained relatively subdued, risks are growing because of soaring commodities prices and Covid-related disruptions to supply chains.\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe export ban is a double-edged sword for Malaysia, the world\'s second-biggest palm oil producer after Indonesia. Malaysian plantation players stand to gain from a surge in sales and windfall profits from the spike in prices. The country\'s export revenues will likely climb.\n\nCompanies including Boustead Plantations Bhd., Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd., IOI Corporation Bhd. and Sime Darby Plantation Bhd. climbed on Monday, while their Indonesian peers sank. Palm oil futures jumped as much as 7% in early trade, and then retreated as details of the excluded products emerged.\n\nThe higher costs of oilseeds will have a rippling effect across the Malaysian economy with its food inflation already at five-year highs. The government will have to fork out more subsidies to absorb higher costs of palm oil products. The ban would also curtail Malaysia\'s palm oil imports, which are largely from neighboring Indonesia, and tighten local supplies especially for refiners.\n\nMalaysia may also struggle to fill the gap in global demand left by Indonesia as farmers grapple with chronic labor shortages that may only begin to ease from next month. Malaysia makes up about a third of the world\'s palm oil supply, compared to Indonesia\'s lion share of about 60%.\n\nIndonesia\n\nIn the near term, the policy will likely achieve its intended effect of driving down domestic prices of cooking oil given that about 60% of Indonesia\'s palm oil output tends to be exported, according to Citigroup Inc.\n\nIt could also ease inflation expectations, Citigroup said, before indications that the ban would not be as strict as feared. If cooking oil prices revert to early 2021 levels and stabilize from there, it could reduce the bank\'s inflation forecast this year by up to 0.5 percentage points.\n\nThis gain could, however, be offset by “adverse second-round impacts” like surging prices of soybean, a substitute of palm. Indonesia imports the oilseed for things like tofu and tempehs. Soybean products have a similar weight as palm oil in the consumer price basket, the bank notes.', 'image': 'https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-04/9267bcvo_india-grocery-indonesia-bloomberg_625x300_26_April_22.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:59:09'}

On April 19, the Shanghai government decided to relax lockdown measures in three districts to grant 4 million people more freedom of mobility.\n\nAt present, 11.9 million people in 16,650 closed-off management areas cannot leave their homes or workplaces in Shanghai, while 4.5 million people in 13,304 restrictive control areas are not allowed to leave their areas.

All sports and cultural activities in Chaoyang were canceled from Saturday.\n\nYang Peipei, deputy chief of the Chaoyang district government, said some companies in the service sector would be ordered to shut down temporarily. Yang said each of the employees in these affected companies would be compensated 100 yuan (US$15.2) per day for up to 21 days, while each affected company could claim up to 100,000 yuan from an insurance scheme jointly launched by the government and the People’s Insurance Company of China.\n\nYang said residents in Beijing should not be overly concerned about food supplies as key supermarkets had boosted their inventories, while the government had already set up a reserve. She said people who spread rumors and raised food prices would be punished.\n\nHowever, some media reported that vegetables were already sold out in supermarkets in Chaoyang district, as well as in nearby Tongzhou district. People also failed to find fresh food on e-commerce platforms, the reports said.\n\nOn Saturday, Zhengzhou in Henan province announced a lockdown of the entire city for seven days to launch a mandatory testing scheme. Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd said the Zhengzhou-based factory of its unit Foxconn, which assembles iPhones for Apple Inc, would maintain normal production despite the Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone’s lockdown.\n\nThe local government in Yantai in eastern China’s Shandong province said Monday it recorded 36 Covid cases on Sunday. It said it had identified the BA.2.3 Omicron variant, which is highly infectious, after an analysis of 16 Covid samples in the city. Local officials said the coronavirus could have been spread by asymptomatic patients in the city for some time.\n\nHow many Chinese people are now under lockdown, and the impact the lack of mobility will have on the economy, is a matter of analytical debate.\n\nAbout 373 million people in 45 Chinese cities were under some kind of lockdown, the Japanese bank Nomura said in a research report on April 15. At least 30 million people in 22 Chinese cities were still being locked down, Caixin.com reported on April 18, citing a different definition of lockdowns.\n\nNobody knows how long the lockdown in Shanghai will last. Photo: WikiCommons\n\n“China’s GDP for the first quarter of this year came in much stronger than expected while activity slowed in March, reflecting the initial impact of the Covid-19-related restrictions,” Sophie Altermatt, an economist at Julius Baer, said in a research note. “The negative impact on economic activity will likely be more notable in April.”\n\n“If the major outbreaks can be contained and local restrictions eased in the next few weeks, activity might gradually normalize in May,” Altermatt wrote, adding that Julius Baer has downgraded its second-quarter GDP growth forecast to 4.1% year-on-year, but maintained its full-year growth target at 4.7%.\n\nShe said it was unlikely that the policy support recently unveiled by the central government and the PBoC could give a significant boost to the Chinese economy, while more risks would emerge if the Covid-19 outbreaks and restrictions lingered longer.\n\n“Despite the recent geopolitical uncertainty and the Omicron outbreak which has triggered strict mobility restrictions, China’s GDP growth in the first quarter of 2022 reached 4.8% year-on-year,” said Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis.\n\n“However, this growth rate masked a very large difference between the positive first two months and March.”\n\nGarcía-Herrero said the most significant impact of the recent Covid shock was on consumption. She said retail sales collapsed in March with a 3.5% year-on-year decline, compared with 6.7% growth in the first two months of 2022.\n\nShe also said China’s investment decelerated in March from the first two months of this year, while exports also slowed.\n\n“When focusing on the tougher environment for March and the lack of a very large stimulus so far, we find it not easy for the Chinese economy to achieve the 5.5% growth target announced during the two sessions in Beijing,” García-Herrero said.\n\nLocal authorities deliver rapid test kits to a resident in Shanghai on April 3, 2022.

All issues that Marine Le Pen succeeded in bringing to the forefront of the bruising presidential campaign.\n\nMoreover, the hard-Left candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, who lost in the first round two weeks ago, refused to ask the 7.7 million people who voted for him to back Macron.\n\nMeaning, Macron’s victory doesn’t mean France necessarily wanted him to be President, but that they wanted Marine Le Pen even less.\n\nSo, what does India think about an election playing out 8,553 km away? In the good-old days, when the Indian passport wasn’t encased in steel, you could drive from Delhi to Paris via Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Slovenia, Austria and Belgium. Today, a Schengen visa, via France, comes with several tough conditionalities, mostly aimed at plugging loopholes that intrepid illegal migrants may make use of to jump ship.\n\nThis fear, that illegals from developing nations may overwhelm majority Catholic France, has become the new normal. Marine Le Pen has brought these concerns centre-stage and Macron hasn’t been able to allay them.\n\nStill, the answer to who rules France is important not just for France, or the European Union, in which it is embedded, or the UN Security Council of which it is a permanent member – but also for India.\n\nAlso read: Emmanuel Macron’s win is an opportunity for France and the EU\n\nAn Indo-Pacific power\n\nWhy a reader of ThePrint should care who sits in the Elysée is simple: France has occasionally inculcated the odd habit of doing something really different and almost getting away with it. Like the ideas of liberty, egalitarianism and fraternity the French Revolution espoused 223 years ago, which the Indian Constitution embraced with such fervour in 1950. (Of course, France temporarily forgot those ideals when it pursued the colonisation of Algeria some decades ago with exemplary vigour and passion; to its credit, it has tried to wear the warts from those shameful decades on its sleeve.)\n\nNot that France has fully relinquished her colonies. There are still a few littered across the globe – from Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the northern coast of Canada to islands in the Caribbean to French Guiana in South America to territories in the South Pacific, like New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia, which together account for one-third of the Pacific Islands’ combined exclusive economic zone.\n\nThis, along with tiny territories like Reunion, Mayotte, Tromelin and Iles Eparses in the South Indian Ocean allow France the grandiose self-perception of being called an “Indo-Pacific power.”\n\nStill, back in 1998 when India went nuclear, France was the only major power not to have scolded Delhi. The US imposed tough sanctions, as did the UK; even Russia, India’s old friend, was quite irritated it had not been told in advance about India’s intentions. But France understood.\n\nFrance is also the only other country, besides Britain, to have been invited as chief guest to India’s Republic Day celebrations, as many as five times (1976, 1980, 1998, 2008 and 2016). Soon after India got a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group in 2008 to conduct nuclear trade, France became the only other country, besides Russia, to sign an agreement to sell nuclear reactors to India. The French have sold Scorpene submarines and Mirage fighter jets and more recently, Rafale jets – no doubt, the defence deals have sweetened the way for a better diplomatic relationship.\n\nLeaders from both sides have used the highest praise for the other. During his visit to Delhi in January 2016, then-president Francois Hollande said he was determined to “consolidate the strategic partnership” with India; Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded by saying, “India and France are made for each other.”\n\nAlso read: Modi’s India is in a foreign policy sweet spot by playing all sides — US, China, EU, Russia\n\nIndia’s ‘new Russia’\n\nBy 2019, when Modi returned as PM for the second time, the relationship was in even greater form.\n\nDuring his trip to Paris in August 2019, weeks after the government revoked Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and put half the political class in the former state under house arrest, President Macron made no comment about the violation of human rights in the state.\n\nIn fact, at the UNSC closed-door meeting called by China in the wake of the 5 August abrogation—spurred on by Pakistan—France supported India’s stand on Kashmir.\n\nEarlier, too, the French had backed the UNSC resolution sanctioning Pakistani terrorist Masood Azhar (one of three terrorists released in exchange for the passengers of IC-814 in Kandahar in 1999) as well as stronger FATF sanctions against Pakistan.\n\nSoon enough, many in Delhi and Paris began to call France “India’s new Russia.”\n\nCertainly, Macron has been an interesting president these past five years, not least because he has spent several hours conducting shuttle diplomacy with Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine– but at the presidential debate, accused Le Pen of being a Putin spokesman because she allegedly took a loan for her 2017 campaign via a Russian bank.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine in its second month – although US politicians Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin were in Kyiv over this weekend – the newly elected Macron is expected to put himself at the forefront of a united European Union front against Moscow. Certainly, the coming weeks will be interesting not just for the new French president, but for the rest of the international community too.\n\nJyoti Malhotra is a senior consulting editor at ThePrint.

Kishida will reportedly visit the countries from late April to early May, 2022.\n\n“Japan should use its influence as a major economic investor and donor to press Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam to improve their human rights records,” said Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch. “Prime Minister Kishida should recognize that Japan’s credibility depends on fulfilling the government’s human rights pledges by both publicly and privately raising rights concerns while abroad.”\n\nIn Indonesia, Kishida should urge the government of President Joko Widodo to combat religious discrimination by Islamist politicians and militants, and the use of the blasphemy law as a political weapon against opponents and religious minorities. Kishida should highlight that the draft criminal code’s proposed expansion of the blasphemy law threatens the rights to freedom of religion, association, and expression.\n\nPresident Widodo’s government tried to overcome abusive mandatory hijab regulations in state schools in February 2021, but the Supreme Court cancelled the rule. Kishida should urge Widodo to issue a new central government regulation that revokes more than 60 local and national rules that violate women and girls’ rights by requiring them to wear the hijab. The Indonesian government should also end discriminatory government regulations against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.\n\nIn Thailand, Prime Minister Kishida should raise serious concerns with Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha about his government’s intensified restrictions on fundamental rights, particularly free expression and peaceful assembly, by arresting democracy activists and critics of the monarchy. The Thai government has also imposed restrictions on opposition political activities and assemblies by arbitrarily enforcing provisions of a nationwide state of emergency, using the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext, and sometimes violently cracking down on youth-led democracy protests. Kishida should expressly oppose the Thai government’s proposed draft law that would severely restrict nongovernmental organizations, including Japanese government-funded groups, in violation of the rights to freedom of association and expression.\n\nKishida’s visit to Thailand coincides with the 135th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Close political, economic, and sociocultural ties provide Japan with significant leverage to be frank and forthright in stressing that there can be no return to business as usual between Tokyo and Bangkok unless Thailand pursues genuine democratic rule and respect for human rights. In particular, Kishida should press Prayut to end repression of free expression and peaceful assembly.\n\nIn Vietnam, Prime Minister Kishida should express public concerns about the Vietnamese government’s heightened crackdown on human rights activists and bloggers. At least 51 people in Vietnam were put on trial, convicted, and sentenced to many years in prison between December 2020 and April 2022, for exercising their basic rights to freedom of expression, association, and religion. Kishida should call for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners, including Pham Chi Dung, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Le Huu Minh Tuan, Can Thi Theu, Trinh Ba Tu, Pham Chi Thanh, Pham Doan Trang, Trinh Ba Phuong, Nguyen Thi Tam, Do Nam Trung, Le Trong Hung, and Le Van Dung.\n\nJapan is Vietnam’s most important bilateral donor. Kishida should publicly express concerns that the Vietnamese Communist Party prohibits the formation and operation of any organization or group deemed threatening to its monopoly of power. He should press Vietnam to respect freedom of online expression, and to stop blocking access to websites or pressing social media and telecommunications companies to remove contents deemed politically sensitive.\n\nThose who criticize the one-party government, including on social media, face police intimidation, harassment, restricted movement, physical assault, and arbitrary arrest and detention. Police detain political activists for months without access to legal counsel and subject them to abusive interrogations; then, party-controlled courts convict bloggers and activists on bogus national security charges and impose lengthy prison sentences.\n\nIn February this year, Human Rights Watch published the report “‘Locked Inside Our Home’: Movement Restrictions on Rights Activists in Vietnam,” which details the Vietnamese government’s systemic and severe restriction of freedom of movement between 2004 and 2021. In March, security agents prevented eight democracy supporters from attending an event in Hanoi to show solidarity and support for Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion.\n\nKishida should publicly urge the Vietnamese government to release everyone imprisoned for exercising their rights, such as criticizing the government, joining a rights group, or worshiping in a way without Communist Party approval.\n\n“Japan proudly claims its commitment to protecting human rights on the global stage, but in practice it does little to press rights-abusing governments in Asia to improve their records,” Doi said. “Prime Minister Kishida’s Southeast Asia trip is an important opportunity to break with Tokyo’s longstanding public silence on abuses abroad and instead assert global leadership on rights issues.”", 'image': 'https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2022/04/202204asia_japan_kishida.jpg?h=31a53609&itok=BPzppzY1', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:32'}

The increase was an extremely modest two yen – a mere €0.015 ($0.016) – but the symbolism was far more powerful. Yaokin, which has been making the crunchy corn-based snack since 1979 and had never before raised the price, announced in January that prices would have to go up in April due to a combination of rising costs associated with corn imported from the US and soaring fuel costs.\n\nConsumers were shocked to see Umaibo – which translates as "delicious stick" – climb by a massive 20 per cent to 12 yen (€0.087). It turned out to be just the first of many in a nation that previously considered itself effectively immune from inflation. But a prolonged COVID crisis and the war in Ukraine have severely damaged the current economic oulook in the country.\n\nBombshell price hikes\n\nNot long after Yaokin\'s bombshell announcement, Japan\'s three largest milk producers stated that they would have to raise cheese prices, and The Nisshin OilliO Group and J-Oil Mills Inc. said the cost of cooking oil would rise in April. Confectionery firm Fujiya Co has hiked the price of its entire range of chocolate products by as much as 10 per cent, citing rising costs for logistics and ingredients.\n\nIt\'s a similar story in other sectors of the economy, with Nippon Paper Crecia lifting the price of tissue and toilet paper, Kao Corp asking more for some of its diaper products and Bridgestone Corp charging more for its tires. The cost of travelling is also rising, with East Japan Railway Co. increasing the price of bullet train tickets and both domestic carriers, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, lifting prices for many domestic flights from mid-April. And while many of the price increases are relatively small, they have still sent shock waves through a population that cannot comprehend price volatility in everyday staples.\n\nJapanese consumers are worried because the nation has not experienced meaningful inflation since the oil shocks of the 1970s saw energy prices soar by 20 per cent in the space of a year. Those old enough to remember their parents discussing the alarming concept of stagflation are looking with concern at savings, while younger people are looking into their wallets. "I work at a delicatessen that has a lot of imported foods, and prices have clearly gone up in a short space of time," said Yae Oono from Kawasaki city, south of Tokyo. "It looks like all prices are increasing, but I noticed it most on chilled products, like yogurts."\n\nOono said she has also noticed the increase in her own weekly visits to the supermarket. "I don\'t think rice has changed so much yet, but bread and cheese are more expensive than before and we are not eating out as much as we used to," she told DW. "Also, I am trying to use my bicycle or the bus more than my car now as the price of gasoline is definitely higher than a few months ago. It\'s worrying. I wonder how long it will last," she added. The outlook is not positive, say experts, particularly as the conflict in Ukraine continues, and supply chains come under renewed pressure while the global economy contracts.\n\nBank of Japan\'s bad news\n\nIn mid-April, the Bank of Japan announced that the domestic corporate goods price index had reached its highest point since 1982, with the central bank attributing the 9.5 per cent year-on-year increase to surging prices for crude oil and grain triggered by the nascent recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. That increase was exacerbated by the Ukraine conflict and the sudden sharp fall in the value of the yen serving to lift the price of imports.\n\nAmong the most severely affected sectors were imports of energy, with oil and coal prices up by more than 27 per cent. And the problem of rising prices is exacerbated by another factor, said Martin Schulz, chief policy economist for Fujitsu\'s Global Market Intelligence Unit. "Inflation is worrisome, but some of the focus is now being turned back on stagnating real incomes," he told DW. "As long as there was price stability in Japan – or even the deflation that we have seen for many years here – people did not worry too much. But now we have the double bomb of inflation and incomes stuck at the level they were at 20 years ago and people can only see the downside. Questions are being asked of the Bank of Japan\'s policies, but it is sticking to its line of expansionary policies with interest rates close to zero, just 0.25 per cent," Schulz pointed out.\n\nInvestors out of Japan\n\nThe result is that investors are getting their money out of Japan, the central bank is producing more money to feed into the economy, and the yen is weakening against other global currencies. "The Bank of Japan is doing exactly the opposite of what is needed to stabilize the yen," said Schulz. "The bank has an important two-day meeting from April 28, at which they will discuss their next policy moves. But they have already indicated that they plan to stick with their current policies."\n\nThe bank has for many years set an inflation target of two per cent, but that figure is likely to be surpassed in the coming months, Schulz said, although it will be "transitory" and will eventually drop back again. For a nation not used to such price increases or wages that aren\'t rising in line with the changes, the coming months are likely to cause concern and, for some, more debt or household bankruptcy.', 'image': 'https://frontline.thehindu.com/incoming/shfeut/article38480453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/japan-inflationjpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:06'}

But that includes a 52.7 percent fall in mobile phone charges after a government crackdown on the three-company cartel that virtually controls the sector.\n\nOther figures were eye-popping by Japan standards. Energy costs jumped 20.8 percent, the steepest rise since 1981, while cooking oil increased 34.7 percent. Another measure of inflation at the wholesale level, the Corporate Goods Price Index jumped 9.5 percent year-on-year in March, due in part to the dire situation in Ukraine.\n\nOverall, economists reckon that after smoothing out the various one-time factors, underlying inflation is now around the target of 2 percent. Yet no one appears to be celebrating. Facing elections in June, the government is scrambling to formulate subsidy packages for those most affected, while the Japanese yen is falling sharply in value. Kuroda, however, appears unconcerned, calling the higher costs a short-term issue that will not deter him from his goal.\n\nFor Japan, the costs of more than two decades of deflation are clear. The country remains prosperous, safe, and comfortable, but what many Japanese have not noticed is that the rest of the world has been getting richer in absolute terms, while their country has largely stayed in place. Average annual wages have risen a mere 3 percent over the past 30 years, according to OECD data, compared to a 47 percent gain in the United States. Prices have followed a similar trajectory. Tokyo was for many years ranked as the most expensive city in the world, but Japan’s capital today is not even among the top 10 in most global rankings, with cost cutting, a gradual lowering of tariffs, and greater import substitution helping to bring prices down.\n\nTo break out of this, the central bank has for the past nine years flooded the markets with cash, an unprecedented program that made it the buyer of virtually all new government debt. And with government tax revenues covering just 60 percent of spending in an average year, there is a lot of debt to be bought.\n\nThis creates two big problems. The Japanese government is the most indebted country in the world, with a total debt equal to around 190 percent of annual economic output. This backdoor financing of government largesse has meanwhile quadrupled the balance sheet of the BOJ to the extent that its own holdings rose to 92 percent of annual GDP in 2020, according to World Bank data, compared with 22 percent in the United States and 18 percent in Germany.\n\nWith all this, Japan today seems to have the wrong kind of inflation. The idea behind Kuroda’s target was to create a so-called demand-driven virtuous cycle in which higher-paid workers go out and spend more, pushing up demand, leading to new investment and then higher wages.\n\nInstead, the higher costs from overseas will push up prices and prompt consumers to buy fewer goods, not more. The problem is especially severe in resource-starved Japan, where virtually all raw materials and commodities are imported. That includes more than 60 percent of all the food consumed and around 95 percent of its energy, mainly through oil imports. With generally docile global commodity markets over the past decade, that has not been a huge issue until now, but both wheat and natural gas are in the crosshairs over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the problems are expected to worsen.\n\nNone of this is lost on a government looking to secure a stronger mandate in June elections for the upper house of Japan’s parliament. While the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has no risk of losing control, the level of support in the second chamber is often seen as a gauge of voter sentiment about how things are going. To help cushion the blow of higher prices, the government is reportedly putting together a broad $48 billion package of subsidies to help consumers and small businesses. The assistance ranges from additional gasoline subsidies to low-interest loans and cash assistance, according to Nikkei.\n\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is using the price spike to help push his “new form of capitalism” designed to spread the wealth from the big companies and affluent retirees that have fared well under the last decade of Abenomics under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\n“To cope with rising prices, we will deploy every possible policy measure to protect people’s livelihoods by enabling companies to pass on costs and creating an environment for them to raise wages for workers,” Kishida told a parliamentary session in March.\n\nSkeptics such as Credit Suisse economist and former BOJ official Hiromichi Shirakawa say that asking companies to raise wages even as other costs are going up is a pretty tall order. Japanese consumers have traditionally cut back on their purchasing whenever prices rise. This has made retailers leery of trying to hike prices in the past, leading to the concept of “shrinkflation,” where smaller quantities hide higher unit costs.\n\nWorsening the outlook has been a sudden fall in the value of the Japanese yen, which will make imported goods even more expensive. The yen is nearing 130 to the U.S. dollar, a fall of 10 percent since the start of the year. This will only deepen the economic divide Kishida is trying to narrow. Big companies with heavy overseas interests will reap sharply higher profits as they return their money home, while the average worker will end up paying more at the checkout line.\n\n“As people’s attention turns to higher imported inflation and a weaker yen, it will be necessary to reevaluate and weigh the merits and demerits of not only short-term economic stimulus but also the long-term adverse effects of locking in ultra-loose monetary policy,” said Ryutaro Kono, chief Japan economist at BNP Paribas and a respected BOJ watcher.\n\nFor the longer term, the BOJ’s biggest threat is an inflationary cycle that gets out of control. “If the public were to become convinced that the BOJ’s policy stance is exacerbating the yen’s slide and pushing prices higher, the bank could become the villain driving the increasing burden on households,” Deutsche Bank Tokyo chief economist Kentaro Koyama said in a recent report. But raising interest rates, the traditional way to combat rising prices, would not just put the brakes on an already weak economy—it would also cause massive losses on the BOJ’s holdings of government debt.\n\nBut Kuroda is not deterred, and the central bank has kept up its bond-buying program in recent weeks despite the worries over debt levels and the falling yen. His goal, he has always insisted, is to break Japan from the “deflation mindset.” With price rises like these, he may well be on the way to success.\n\nThe question is whether these fresh worries, combined with Japan’s aging society, shrinking workforce, and slow growth, will create a long-term and potentially irreversible downturn. While the outlook is problematic, Japan has defied the skeptics many times in the past. “Japan is the hardest economy in the world to understand,” Citigroup’s then-chief economist Willem Buiter said at a 2010 event. “If this were physics, then gravity wouldn’t work in Japan.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JAPAN-BANKS-INFLATION-GettyImages-1086818764.png?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:59:00'}

While the BJP slammed the Congress, accusing the party of ‘politicising’ the education system, the state government has dismissed the allegations. The Central Ministry of Education has also sought comments from the state on the question paper.\n\n“Unable to attract people to join the party, the Congress is now trying to promote its ideology among the younger generation by asking questions about their party in examinations. Ever since it came to power, the Congress has been consistently making changes to textbooks. They don’t care about freedom fighters such as Veer Savarkar. Even people like former PM P V Narsimha Rao or Atal Bihari Vajpayee don’t have enough space in school textbooks while now there are entire pages on Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi,” says BJP MLA Vasudev Devnani, who was education minister in the Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government between 2013 and 2018.\n\nSenior Congress leader and Education Minister B D Kalla denied Devnani’s allegations and insisted that the examination is conducted by the RBSE, an autonomous body, in line with the NCERT syllabus.\n\nDevnani’s allegations are reminiscent of similar accusations levelled at him by the Congress, when it was in the opposition in the state.\n\nThe previous BJP government made changes in the Class 10 history textbook, declaring Maharana Pratap as the winner of the 16th Century battle of Haldighati and Akbar as the one he defeated. The Mughal emperor also lost his prefix ‘Great’ in the textbook.\n\nThe Class 8 textbook had removed Jawaharlal Nehru while other textbooks gave substantial space to Savarkar, eclipsing even Gandhi.\n\nAlso Read | New icons in NCERT books: Bajirao to Maharana Pratap\n\nSubsequently, days after the Congress government came to power in December 2018, Govind Singh Dotasra, who held the education portfolio from 2019-21, asserted that the education department under the BJP had become the “laboratory of the RSS”.\n\nIn February 2019, the Congress government formed textbook review committees and, later that year, new textbooks were printed based on the recommendations of the committees.\n\nOne of the major changes was about the battle of Haldighati. While the textbook printed in the BJP regime said Maharana Pratap won the battle, in the new Class 10 social science books, the portion on the Haldighati battle ends with Pratap leaving the battlefield and his horse Chetak dying. It also mentions that the clash between Maharana Pratap and Akbar was not a religious war, but a clash for superiority between two political forces. Silent on the result of the battle, the chapter goes on to describe Pratap’s guerrilla warfare against Akbar in subsequent years.\n\nThe new Class 12 history textbook dropped the ‘Veer’ prefix for Savarkar and referred to him as ‘Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’. The new textbook talks of Savarkar’s “mercy petitions to the British” and how, following his release from captivity, Savarkar worked towards establishing India as a “Hindu nation”.\n\nThe changes made by the Congress had resulted in angry outbursts from the BJP, which accused organisations such as the Rajiv Gandhi Study Circle (RGSC), which has Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot as its chairperson, of furthering the Congress’s ideology.\n\nOffice bearers of the RGSC, however, denied the BJP’s charge, in turn alleging that the tradition of changing textbooks began during the earlier BJP regime. “The BJP first meddled in matters related to education in 1993 when the party changed textbook syllabi in Rajasthan, inserting elements of the RSS ideology. Subsequent Congress governments have only rectified these distortions and made the syllabus in tune with the NCERT. The Rajiv Gandhi Study Circle creates awareness about the Constitution, the ideals of Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar,” says Bane Singh, state coordinator, RGSC.\n\nWith over a year left for the next Assembly election, the BJP says it is committed to making changes to textbooks if it comes to power. “After we come to power, we will set up a committee to review the distortions made in the Congress regime and we will undo the changes in textbooks made by the Congress government,” says Devnani.\n\nThe final chapter on textbook revisions is yet to be written.', 'image': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/04/kids-1-1.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:55'}

Russia made a payment due on April 4 on two sovereign bonds -- maturing in 2022 and 2042 -- in rubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the securities\' terms.

Encircled by Russian troops for weeks, Mariupol has seen the fiercest fighting and the most comprehensive destruction since Russia invaded the country on Feb. 24. The main port on the Sea of Azov is the biggest target in the eastern Donbas region that Moscow now calls the focus of its campaign. If captured, Mariupol will be the first major city to fall since the war began. Its capture will help secure a land passage between separatist-held eastern areas and Crimea which Russia annexed and seized in 2014.\n\n1:27 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin said peace talks with Ukraine had hit a dead end. Addressing the war in public for the first time since Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine after they were halted at the gates of Kyiv, Putin promised that Russia would achieve all of its "noble" aims in Ukraine. "We have again returned to a dead-end situation for us," Putin, Russia\'s paramount leader since 1999, told a news briefing.\n\n11:24 a.m. U.S. President Joe Biden said for the first time that Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine amounts to genocide, a significant escalation of the president\'s rhetoric. Biden used the term in a speech at an ethanol plant in Iowa and later stood by the description as he prepared to board Air Force One.\n\n"Yes, I called it genocide because it has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian, and the evidence is mounting," Biden told reporters.\n\n4:55 a.m. The World Bank is preparing a $1.5 billion support package for war-torn Ukraine and plans to aid developing countries struggling to keep up with surging food and energy prices, World Bank President David Malpass said.\n\n"The World Bank was created in 1944 to help Europe rebuild after World War II. As we did then, we will be ready to help Ukraine with reconstruction when the time comes," Malpass said.

British Foreign Minister Liz Truss on Monday said the country was working with its partners to verify the details of reports Russian forces may have used chemical agents in an attack on Mariupol. "There are some things that are beyond the pale, and the use of chemical weapons will get a response and all options are on the table for what that response could be," Heappey told Sky News on Tuesday.\n\n2:20 p.m. Fighting in eastern Ukraine will intensify over the next two to three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there, the U.K.\'s Ministry of Defense tweeted in a regular bulletin. Russian attacks remain focused on Ukrainian positions near Donetsk and Luhansk, with further fighting around Kherson and Mykolaiv and a renewed push toward Kramatorsk, British military intelligence said.

The Russian Defence Ministry made an official statement in late March that it had achieved its major military objectives in the rest of the country and was therefore lifting the siege on cities outside the Donbas region, like the capital, Kyiv. It has been clear for some time that the eventual goal of the Russian military operation is to ensure the long-term security of the Donbas republics and the Crimean Peninsula, which had opted to break away from Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the media in the second week of April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded with the West to supply even more weaponry, warning that if the entire Donbas region fell, then the capital would again come under siege. The Russian military and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been reiterating that the limited military operations in the rest of Ukraine are over and that the Russian armed forces are now completely focussed on “the liberation” of the Donbas region.\n\nWhile calling for more military help from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), Zelensky is at the same time continuing to insist that he is willing to negotiate a peace deal with Moscow. He has been saying for some weeks that his country would no longer aspire to be a NATO member and would embrace neutrality if the West agreed to provide his country with binding security guarantees. The United States, the United Kingdom, Poland and Turkey, all NATO members, were quick to signal that they were amenable to this proposal. It was no surprise that Russia threw cold water on the latest proposal, which would mean a back-door entry for NATO into Ukraine. Zelensky claims that the security guarantees from the West are needed as Ukraine had voluntarily given up its nuclear weapons. It is true that Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal between 1993 and 1996 after becoming an independent country following the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). However, it is also a fact that the de facto ownership of the nuclear weapons was with the Russian Federation. Kazakhstan, another member state of the USSR, also voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons. It was mainly Russian scientists and nuclear technicians who were in charge of the nuclear installations in the former Soviet Union. The West was happy when the Ukrainians and the Kazakhs decided to give up their nuclear weapons.\n\nImmense damage to Ukrainian economy\n\nZelensky continues to pay lip service to the need to end the conflict, which started in the last week of February and has caused immense damage to the Ukrainian economy. In a recent report, the World Bank predicted that the country’s economy would shrink by a staggering 45.1 per cent this year as a result of the conflict. The Russian economy is predicted to shrink by more than 10 per cent. The rouble has bounced back considerably after the initial shock resulting from the draconian economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the West.\n\nPutin made a prediction in mid April that the U.S.-led sanctions would boomerang on the West. He pointed out that Western countries were already feeling “the pain”. Fuel and food prices have registered a sharp increase in European countries. Inflation is rising not only in western Europe but also in the U.S. as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. Putin said that the European Union countries had shown once again that they were acting as a “poodle” of the U.S. Speaking to the media in mid April, Putin claimed that the U.S.-led “blitzkrieg” to humble Russia had failed yet again. “We are not going to isolate ourselves, and it is generally impossible to isolate anyone in the modern world, and most certainly not a country as huge as Russia,” Putin said. He conceded that what was happening in Ukraine was “a tragedy” but once again reiterated that Russia had been left with no option but to invade Ukraine as the West was turning the country into an “anti-Russian bridgehead”.\n\nAlso read: IMF slashes global growth outlook amid Ukraine conflict\n\nEver since the U.S. announced its intention to incorporate Ukraine and Georgia into NATO in 2008, Russia had been warning that under no circumstances would it accept such a development. Russia had reluctantly accepted as a fait accompli the incorporation of former Soviet republics such as Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia into NATO but had drawn a “red line” in the case of Ukraine and Georgia, the two countries with which it has close historical and cultural ties.\n\nLulled by the Russian military’s seeming inability to capture Ukraine’s big cities, the West is pressing the Ukrainian army to go on fighting. However, the hope that the Russian army would be caught in a military quagmire in Ukraine is fading by the day. In the first two weeks of April, the West has funnelled in more lethal weaponry to the Ukrainian armed forces. The conflict in Ukraine has now been virtually transformed into a NATO-Russia war at the instigation of the Biden administration.\n\nIn the second week of April, Slovakia, a NATO member, announced that it had transferred S-300 Soviet-era air defence units to Ukraine. The S-300 is a surface-to-air missile system. The U.S. immediately gifted the Slovaks with its Patriot missile system as a token of gratitude. “To enable this transfer and ensure the continued security of Slovakia, the United States will reposition its Patriot missile system to Slovakia,” President Joseph Biden said in a statement. The Biden administration had failed earlier to persuade Poland to transfer its Mig-29 fighters to Ukraine. Russia had warned that it would consider such a move an act of war. Eduard Heger, the right-wing Prime Minister of Slovakia, hastened to clarify that his government’s move did not mean that the Slovak Republic “has become part of the armed conflict in Ukraine”. U.S. military experts said the decision to send S-300s to Ukraine marked a new phase in the ongoing conflict.\n\nBut within days of the announcement, the Russian military spokesman claimed that four S-300 units transported into Ukraine by NATO had been targeted and destroyed in the city of Dnipro. The Russian military has made it clear that it will destroy Western military equipment as soon as it crosses the Ukrainian border. Biden meanwhile continues with his insulting tirade against his Russian counterpart, calling him a “dictator” who has committed “genocide” in Ukraine. In the third week of April, the White House said that the U.S. would be providing another $750 million in military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nExistential threat\n\nProfessor John Mearsheimer, an international relations expert who teaches at the University of Chicago, recently said that Russia viewed Ukrainian and Georgian membership of NATO as “an existential threat”, and therefore, this was a “must-win” conflict for the Russian government. Speaking on Russian television, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the main goal of the “special military operation” in Ukraine was “to put an end to the reckless expansion and the reckless course towards complete dominance, of the United States”.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of a new spaceport in the Far East of Russia on April 12, Putin said that peace talks had reached “a dead end”, putting the blame on the recent actions of the Ukrainian government, including conducting “false flag operations” in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Putin said that “British Intelligence” had fabricated evidence about a massacre of civilians in Bucha. He described it as a “provocation” staged by the British government. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in Kyiv soon after the horrific pictures of the killings in the Kyiv suburb hit international headlines.\n\nBelarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko, who was also present at the ceremony presided over by Putin, said that there was clinching evidence of British involvement in the staging of the alleged Bucha incident. The Western media glossed over video footage of Ukrainian forces executing Russian soldiers and the arrests of thousands of civilians, prominent politicians and businessmen on the suspicion of being Russian sympathisers or spies.\n\nAlso read: Why Donbas is so important for Russia\n\nPutin also said that the inflexible negotiating position adopted by the Ukrainian side during the talks in Istanbul was unacceptable to Russia. He said that the “military operations will continue until its full completion”. He once again specified that the goal of military operations centred around the Donbas region, which has been up in arms against the central government since the U.S.-sponsored Euromaidan revolution of 2014. “We will act rhythmically and calmly, according to the plan that was initially proposed by the General Staff,” Putin said. “Our goal is to help the people of Donbas who feel an unbreakable bond with Russia.” The Russian army seems to be on the verge of achieving its military goals in the eastern part of the country. The important southern port city of Mariupol has been the first to fall. More than a thousand Ukrainian marines defending the city surrendered in the third week of April. The capture of Mariupol would allow Russian troops to move north to link up with the Russian army that is trying to move south from the city of Izyum. If this happens, the bulk of the Ukrainian army concentrated further east will be surrounded by the Russian forces. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city, is also under immense pressure from the Russian military and the Donbas militias.\n\nThe U.S. has used the alleged human rights violations by Russian forces in Bucha and other parts of Ukraine to further isolate Russia in international forums. A U.S.-sponsored resolution in the United Nations General Assembly to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was approved in the first week of April after a majority of member states voted with the U.S. The Biden administration had put considerable pressure on governments to vote for the resolution. Despite this, 24 states voted against it and 58 abstained. India was among the prominent countries having good relations with Russia that abstained. China, as expected, voted against the resolution. Moscow had urged all its friends and allies to oppose the resolution, stating that abstention would be viewed as an “unfriendly act”. After the vote, Russia announced that it was quitting the UNHRC.\n\nThe Indian government has been abstaining in all the resolutions on the Ukraine conflict tabled in the U.N. so far. The Biden administration has not hidden its disapproval of the Indian government’s stance and its willingness to do business as usual with Russia. Biden told Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of the recent 2+2 ministerial meeting in Washington between the Indian Foreign and Defence Ministers and their U.S. counterparts that India should not increase its reliance on Russian oil and gas.\n\nAlso read: Power and myth of the Kremlin\n\nThe U.S. was angry with India’s decision to buy discounted Russian oil soon after the conflict in Ukraine broke out. “We share a close and growing major defence partnership,” Biden said in his opening remarks. “The United States and India will continue our close consultation on how to manage the destabilising efforts of the Russian war.”\n\nThe Indian side has been pointing out that the U.S.’ European allies such as Germany, Hungary and Italy are against a ban on the import of Russian oil and gas. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that the amount of Russian oil India purchased in a month was less than what countries like Germany purchased in a day. Russian oil accounts for less than 1 per cent of India’s energy imports. Top officials in the Biden administration have also been advising the Indian government to wean itself off Russian armaments; 60 per cent of India’s arms imports are sourced from Russia.

That underscores the accelerating preparations for war against China, with Australia as a key launching platform.\n\nThis points to the reality behind the increasingly incendiary comments by Prime Minster Scott Morrison and Defence Minister Peter Dutton about preparing for war, and the response of the Labor Party, which has criticised the Liberal-National Coalition government for not moving fast enough to acquire missiles, drones and other weaponry.\n\nFor fear of triggering popular opposition, the top-level US delegation’s trip to Pine Gap, just 20 kilometres southwest of Alice Springs, was kept out of official press releases. No coverage appeared in the major Australian corporate media outlets.\n\nHowever, the US military chiefs involved spoke to the Financial Times of London, a newspaper of the corporate elite, about the war capabilities being expanded at Pine Gap.\n\nThe head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral John Aquilino, who last year declared that war against China was “much closer than most think,” described Australia as an “extremely high-end partner.”\n\nReferring to Pine Gap, Aquilino said enhanced visibility in space would help counter Chinese hypersonic weapons. “The ability to identify and track and defend against those hypersonics is really the key,” he said.\n\nAquilino heads the largest US command, comprising some 380,000 military personnel armed with warplanes, warships, submarines and the latest weaponry. His visit sent a threatening pre-election political message against any wavering from the bipartisan commitment to these preparations.\n\nAccording to the Australian Defence Department press release, the purpose of his visit was “to demonstrate unequivocally the strength and depth of the Australia–United States Alliance.”\n\nAccompanying Aquilino, the head of the US Space Command, General James Dickinson, said Australia was a “critical partner” in space warfare, including to monitor Chinese space operations. “This is the perfect location for a lot of things we need to do,” he told the Financial Times.\n\nCasting aside the façade that such operations are purely defensive, the deputy head of the US Cyber Command, Lieutenant General Charles Moore, openly referred to offensive capabilities. He said digital convergence between the US and Australia gave the US the “potential to perform offensive operations” and an “asymmetric advantage” over China, which lacked such global reach.\n\nBehind the backs of the Australian population, and with the complete support of the Labor Party, the Liberal-National Coalition government has allowed Washington to undertake a major expansion of the Pine Gap facility.\n\nAuthorised by Australian governments, both Labor and Coalition, since it was established in 1970, Pine Gap has long given the US military satellite coverage of a wide swathe of the world, including China, Southeast Asia, East Asia, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific.\n\nNow, with its 40 or so giant domes and access to more powerful satellites, the base is being more closely integrated into the Pentagon’s preparations for hi-tech warfare against China including the use of long-range hypersonic missiles and space weapons being developed by the US.\n\nThe danger of nuclear conflict is rising. The US is testing highly manoeuvrable and virtually undetectable hypersonic missiles that can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, while saying China is doing the same, with missiles that can be launched from space.\n\nWriting in the Saturday Paper, Brian Toohey reported that Pine Gap now had at least four advanced satellites connected to it. “From Pine Gap, a vast volume of military data is fed into the US war fighting machine in real time,” he noted.\n\nThe satellites intercepted “a huge array of electronic signals for intelligence analysis,” as well as from weapon systems, such as surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, fighter planes, drones and space vehicles. Added capabilities now allowed the satellites to detect and track the heat from spacecraft, as well as from missiles and military jets.\n\nAmerican National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed in documents published in 2013 and 2017 that Pine Gap plays a critical role in assisting US military operations, including identifying targets for missile attacks and drone assassinations, and in NSA programs to collect electronic data on people around the world.\n\nAs part of the US-led “Five Eyes” global intelligence network—including Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand—intelligence agencies have high-level access to the NSA data, including on Australian citizens, which could be used to target opponents of the US war drive.\n\nOne Australian government after another has shielded Pine Gap’s activities. In 2009, the last Labor government made it a crime, punishable by up to seven years’ imprisonment, to enter the base’s perimeters, fly over it, or acquire “a photograph, sketch, plan, model, article, note or other document of, or relating to” Pine Gap.\n\nAs part of the Obama administration’s “pivot” to Asia to confront China, the Gillard Labor government also offered Darwin as the site for annual rotations of US Marines, plus northern airfields for extensive use by American long-range bombers, and ports for more visits by US warships and submarines.\n\nThese facilities, now being expanded, thoroughly integrate Australia into US war plans. As a result, any war or military attack by Washington—whether against China or Russia, or in the Middle East—automatically involves Australia.\n\nLast September’s AUKUS military pact between the governments of the US, UK and Australia was an historic step toward a confrontation with China. AUKUS initially featured the supply of nuclear-powered long-range attack submarines to Australia, and the construction of bases in Australia for such submarines, including those from the US and UK.\n\nOn April 6, the AUKUS leaders—Morrison, Biden and Boris Johnson—went further. They announced they would develop hypersonic missiles and subsurface robots, and site such missiles in Australia.\n\nThe Socialist Equality Party (SEP) is the sole party standing in the May 21 federal election opposing the explosion of militarism and war, including Australia’s frontline participation in the US-led war drive.\n\nAs we say in our election statement, only a unified anti-war movement of the international working class—including Chinese, American, British and Australian workers—can halt the reckless US-led plunge toward a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nWe call for the repudiation of the US-Australia alliance and all military basing arrangements with the US and other countries. The military-intelligence apparatus must be disbanded, and the vast resources—more than $600 billion this decade—being squandered on war preparations reallocated to urgently needed social programs throughout Australia and the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThese demands raise the necessity for the working class to seize the reins of power.

War between major powers is no longer a remote possibility in the 21st century. But Canberra isn’t moving fast enough to prepare for a future in which our sovereignty and strategic interests are directly challenged by a hostile great power.\n\nRight across the Indo-Pacific, China’s growing military presence and aggressive grey-zone coercion are threatening the regional order, undermining Australia’s security from the South China Sea to Solomon Islands. Faced with the most dangerous strategic environment since 1942, Australia urgently needs a more robust and imaginative statecraft.\n\nRegardless of who wins the 21 May federal election, at least five things are needed to chart a more decisive regional strategy.\n\nFirst, Canberra should follow Berlin’s lead and establish a one-off, multibillion-dollar fund to build a stronger Australian Defence Force for the 2020s.\n\nToday’s ADF lacks the range and depth to pose dilemmas for a highly capable adversary in Australia’s immediate region. Although Defence has dismissed its longstanding assumption that Australia would have a 10 years’ strategic warning in advance of conflict, too many of its planned military investments are set to deliver in the never-never of the 2030s and 2040s.\n\nMore diversified capabilities are needed now—purchased off the shelf—to expand the options available to future governments. This includes large stocks of long-range missiles for deterrent effect, enabled by larger investments in mobility, theatre-level logistics and forward basing.\n\nThe ADF should buy the US Army’s long-range hypersonic weapon, further expand its electronic warfare portfolio, rapidly field lethal autonomous platforms, and develop more counter-space means. Expanding the Australian Signals Directorate’s offensive cyber and signals intelligence capabilities is a welcome start. But new unorthodox manoeuvre and intelligence options are also needed for the ADF to pose its own grey-zone challenges—going beyond the window-dressing reforms in the wake of the Brereton inquiry into special forces.\n\nSecond, the ADF’s force structure, size and operational fighting concepts must be critically reviewed against the principal adversary that Australia faces: China.\n\nThis review should be conducted externally, akin to Paul Dibb’s seminal mid-1980s work, and occur early in the new term of government. While the 2020 defence strategic update brought a sober and clear-headed strategy, the accompanying force structure plan was a misfire.\n\nThe ADF can’t afford to perpetuate a legacy ‘balanced force’ in which all services are made to feel special. Instead, hard choices must be made to design a force and way of fighting tailored to Australia’s strategic geography.\n\nADF personnel growth needs to be a quick march to a minimum 80,000 this decade, not a ‘strollout’ by 2040. Crucially, if spending 3% of GDP on defence is to be fiscally credible, Canberra must stop wasting billions on non-performing or irrelevant capabilities like heavy armoured vehicles and a $45-billion Hunter-class frigate program that won’t deliver its first ship until 2033, with the last to arrive in 2047.\n\nThird, Australia must expand its value proposition as a ‘partner of choice’ to deepen and diversify its defence partnerships across the Indo-Pacific.\n\nWhile progress is being made with established partners like Japan and Singapore, it’s far too slow and, in key aspects, continues to favour form over substance. Australia must pick up the pace to transform these relationships into vehicles for coordinated regional strategy, both bilaterally and with the US and other partners.\n\nElsewhere, Australia must be humble and strive to build deeper defence ties with Indonesia, India, Vietnam and the Philippines. This means providing more of the direct and tangible collaboration these nations want, such as expanding military intelligence sharing, routinely conducting combined operational activities and increasing the sophistication of exercises. Buying Australian military hardware and supplies also needs to be made easier.\n\nRealising two-way trust in this process will be hard and require more discipline. But it’s only by offering practical cooperation that exceeds expectations that Canberra can build the robust alignments essential for defending and preserving a resilient Indo-Pacific order.\n\nFourth, Australia must pursue a more ambitious diplomacy and bolster its capacity to wield regional influence and foster meaningful engagement.\n\nDiplomacy needs to be valued as a national capability, like military and intelligence means, led by seasoned professionals and funded accordingly. But the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been under-resourced for too long.\n\nDismantling AusAID, the Australia Network and Radio Australia during the Abbott era was an own goal that squandered established advantages, especially in the Pacific. While infrastructure financing initiatives have delivered some results, the Solomons Islands’ security pact with China highlights the limits of this tool in the absence of a comprehensive Australian statecraft.\n\nA regional influence agency should be considered to synchronise Australia’s public narrative, broadcasting, financing, humanitarian aid and disaster recovery efforts. Here, business, cultural and sporting bodies are Canberra’s best tools. But Australia’s regional interests demand a hybrid approach that brings the nation’s mandarins and non-government leaders under one roof.\n\nA larger civil crisis capability is also needed, beyond the ADF, that can be deployed quickly and sustained overseas for longer. So long as global temperatures and sea levels continue to rise, the incidence and severity of climate-related disasters impacting our Pacific neighbours will increase—and Australia has a moral and strategic responsibility to do more.\n\nFinally, the bipartisan Advisory War Council mechanism that guided Australia’s World War II effort should be reprised and adapted for today’s challenges.\n\nBy bringing together the cabinet’s National Security Committee with two or three opposition representatives, Australia could pursue an integrated, long-term strategy more effectively. A new national security council–like organ should enable this approach, organising Australian statecraft at a whole-of-nation level. To be effective, it must have a flat structure, be small in size and have a top-down mandate for conducting net assessments and grand strategy. Like its international peers, it should be staffed with leading talent from across politics, government, think tanks, business, the sciences and academia, bringing foresight and direction to what is currently an unimaginative interagency process for driving Australia’s regional strategy.\n\nThese aren’t the only answers. But they will help Canberra accelerate preparations for a more perilous future.

The conventions were established by the International Labor Organization (ILO), which in February published a report expressing “deep concerns” about China’s discriminatory labor policies and “coercive measures” in Xinjiang. While the Chinese government has long discussed plans to ratify the conventions, the timing may purposely coincide with the government’s efforts to repair deteriorating EU-China relations and prepare for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ visit to Xinjiang in May. AFP reported on the NPC’s vote:\n\nOn Wednesday, China’s top legislature approved the ratification of the International Labour Organization’s Forced Labour Convention, as well as the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, according to official announcements on the National People’s Congress website. […] Members who ratify the two conventions are obliged to suppress and not use any form of forced or compulsory labour, according information on the ILO’s website. They should also take measures to secure the “immediate and complete abolition” of such labour. [Source]\n\nIn ratifying these conventions, China must agree to suppress any form of forced labor used in a variety of specific circumstances, including “as a means of political coercion or education or as a punishment for holding or expressing political views or views ideologically opposed to the established political, social or economic system,” and “as a means of racial, social, national or religious discrimination.” A press release from the ILO described the director-general’s satisfaction with China’s progress:\n\nILO Director-General Guy Ryder, said “I welcome the ratification by China of these two ILO Fundamental Conventions on forced labour. The move demonstrates China’s strong support for ILO values and reflects its commitment to protect any female or male workers from being trapped into forced labour practices, which have no place nor justification in today’s world. This is a milestone on the road towards universal ratification of the forced labour Conventions and the realization of Sustainable Development Goal 8, Target 7 .” “I expect [these] ratifications to create renewed momentum and further efforts by the government and the social partners in China to support human-centred development and decent work in the second largest economy in the world, in line with the ILO Centenary Declaration on the Future of Work .” [Source]\n\nThere are eight fundamental ILO conventions. China had previously ratified four: those on equal pay, discrimination, minimum age, and child labor. Thus far, it has not yet ratified those on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. The two conventions on forced labor will enter into force for China one year after their ratification is formally submitted to the ILO.\n\nI welcome the decision by #China to ratify the #ILO Forced Labour Convention 1930 and the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention 1957. However, it is crucial that they are implemented effectively without delay. I urge #China to ratify the Protocol of 2014 also. — UN Special Rapporteur Tomoya Obokata (@TomObokata) April 21, 2022\n\nEU-China relations may have played a role in China’s ratification of these conventions on forced labor. In the draft Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), a massive investment treaty that was under negotiation between Brussels and Beijing, China would have been required to make “continued and sustained efforts on its own initiative” to pursue ratification of the ILO’s conventions on forced labor. Many EU lawmakers felt that this wording was too vague and that it provided Beijing with too much wiggle room to delay ratification indefinitely. Amid the negotiations, the EU sanctioned several Chinese officials involved in Xinjiang’s “re-education” camps in March of last year, and China immediately retaliated with sanctions against a host of EU officials, agencies, researchers, and one think tank, leading Brussels to officially suspend negotiations on the CAI in May. Since then, China’s support for Russia in its war against Ukraine has further hardened the EU’s stance on China and, as some have argued, effectively killed the CAI. China’s move to ratify the ILO conventions may signal its desire for rapprochement.\n\nIf the ILO conventions are ratified by 🇨🇳that would remove a key obstacle on #CAI. Beijing may be signaling that they want to improve frosty relations w/ the EU & curtail US influence. Qstn is, even if Beijing ratifies these key ILO conventions, will they actually be adhered to? — Theresa Fallon (@TheresaAFallon) April 15, 2022\n\nHowever, many observers took a cynical view of the ratification. MERICS analyst Francesca Ghiretti said the ratification would “not be enough” to revive the CAI: “It is an attempt to build the conditions for a more positive relationship with the EU during these tense times,” but “we should not expect much more than that.” Channeling the reaction from Washington, researcher Adrien Zenz stated, “In D.C., I think the trust in what China does is so low, especially in Xinjiang, that people are going to see this as little more than a cynical gesture,” adding, “People there are going to consider it to be window dressing—a ratification of something the Chinese won’t enforce.” Mimi Lau from the South China Morning Post described the mostly lukewarm reactions from other China-watchers:\n\n“[The move] is also to warm its relations with the EU in view of the increasing cleavage with the US over the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to try reviving the CAI which has been on ventilator because of the EU-China spat over sanctions,” said [Surya Deva, professor of law at Macquarie University in Australia]. He said the ratification would give more opportunities to scrutinise China’s track record on labour rights at the ILO level but was unlikely to have much impact on the ground in eliminating forced labour. “Effective protection of labour rights requires a supportive ecosystem with multiple elements, but most of these are missing within the current Chinese politico-legal system. The lack of independent trade unions and free media are a case in point,” Deva said. […] Aidan Chau, a researcher with the China Labour Bulletin, said the move was a “diplomatic decision” that would not lead to any meaningful domestic changes. [Source]\n\nResponding to these critical reactions, the Global Times tried to reframe the ratification as a purely domestic issue of protecting workers’ rights, with the headline: “China’s ratification of intl forced labor conventions has little to do with Western pressure: expert.” However, in the penultimate line paraphrasing the expert, the author of the article admitted: “Joining the two international conventions will help to counter the US’ wanton long-arm jurisdiction of imposing sanctions, citing untenable accusations.” In December, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would ban imports from Xinjiang unless they can be proven to be made without forced labor, and announced new sanctions on Chinese companies and entities operating in Xinjiang. Acts such as these have shifted the burden of proof and made it harder for companies, as well as the Chinese government, to rely on stated commitments (as opposed to on-the-ground evidence) when proclaiming the nonexistence of forced labor.\n\nAlso from my thread yesterday: in 1997 the Chinese gov told the ILO that the conventions applicable to HK would continue to apply, while at the same time, gutting the laws related to those bills. The int\'l community gets one thing, on the ground anotherhttps://t.co/ziv8Eurfsw — William Nee (@williamnee) April 20, 2022\n\n(Literally) unbelievable: "The move demonstrates #China’s strong support for ILO values and reflects its commitment to protect any female or male workers from being trapped into forced labour practices…" Worse: unverifiable. @hrw_chinese https://t.co/1zzxQt7JKo — Sophie Richardson (@SophieHRW) April 21, 2022\n\nChina’s ratification of the ILO’s forced labor conventions also occurred one month before UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet is scheduled to visit Xinjiang. Her visit and report on human rights violations in the region are long overdue. The visit was originally announced in September 2018, and the Chinese government has stalled ever since. In September 2021, Bachelet stated that her office was finalizing the report, which was to be ready in a matter of weeks, but it has still not been published.\n\nHuman rights groups have ramped up pressure on Bachelet over her report and upcoming visit. Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Director Joanne Mariner stated that it is “vital that any visit by High Commissioner Bachelet be independent and unhindered,” adding, “A fact-finding mission hampered by state control could end up whitewashing human rights violations – potentially making the UN complicit in promoting Chinese government propaganda.” The message was reiterated by American ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield: “And let’s be clear: any visit by the High Commissioner to China must have unhindered and unfettered access.” In January, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian stated that China would welcome Bachelet’s visit to Xinjiang only “to promote exchange and cooperation, not for an investigation.” Given that the conditions of the visit have not been publicly disclosed, some human rights researchers have even called on Bachelet to simply not go in order to avoid whitewashing the violations. Human Rights Watch, along with 59 other groups, has argued that the credibility of Bachelet’s visit is at risk:\n\n“The Chinese government has given no indication that the UN high commissioner will be allowed to see anything they don’t want her to see,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. “She should not fail the victims of crimes against humanity and other grave abuses by enabling the Chinese authorities to manipulate her visit.” […] “Without an ambitious and robust agenda to advance human rights in China, Bachelet’s visit risks empowering the abusers, not their victims,” Richardson said. “High Commissioner Bachelet should leave a legacy as someone who stood up to Beijing, not someone who let down those who suffer under it.” [Source]\n\nIn a recent profile of Gene Bunin, creator of the Xinjiang Victims Database, Rob Hastings of iNews described how, despite stalled accountability efforts at the UN level, small acts of documentation by average citizens can coalesce into a powerful testament to those subject to forced labor and other abuses in Xinjiang:', 'image': 'https://chinadigitaltimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDT-logo.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:41'}

The man said the accident is too painful and he has trouble forgiving the operator for taking away a young life.\n\nReports also said the child found on Sunday was a three-year-old girl whose parents are still missing.\n\nAverage April sea temperatures in the area are just above freezing. Experts say the low temperature and strong wind make the chances of survival low.\n\nThe bodies recovered on Sunday were found in the same area near the tip of the peninsula, about 8.7 miles (14km) north from where the boat sent a distress call. Some were plucked from the sea, and others were found where they had washed on to the rocky coast.\n\nSquare orange lifesaving floats with the boat’s name on them were also found on the rocks, the Coast Guard said, adding that the operator told them everyone on the boat was wearing a life vest though some of the victims were found without them.\n\nRescuers attend to a person found on a rocky area near the tip of Shiretoko Peninsula in northern Japan (The 1st Regional Japan Coast Guard Headquarters/AP)\n\nExperts and local fishermen and boat operators also say they believe the boat was likely to have run aground after it was tossed around in high waves and damaged.\n\nHigh waves and strong winds were forecast when the boat left port, and Japanese media said fishing boats had returned to port before noon on Saturday because of the bad weather.\n\nLocal fisheries co-operative head Kazuhiko Fukayama told NHK television that it was unthinkable for the tour to have gone ahead in weather that was so rough passengers would have found it difficult just to stand still.\n\nA tour boat crew belonging to another operator told NHK that he warned the Kazu 1 crew of rough seas and told them not to go. He also said the same boat ran aground last year and suffered a crack on its bow.\n\nAccounts of local fishermen and tour boat operators suggest Kazu 1 was the only boat in the area, where no other vessels were around to help the sinking boat until the first Coast Guard rescuers arrived at the scene from elsewhere on Hokkaido three hours later.\n\nSaturday’s tour was reportedly the first by the operator this season, and the accident coming just before Japan’s Golden Week holiday which starts in late April could dampen local tourism, which slumped during the pandemic. Japan is still largely closed to foreign visitors.\n\nDeputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiji Kihara told reporters on Monday that the government has instructed sightseeing tour operators nationwide to carry out emergency inspections of their boats to ensure their safe operation.', 'image': 'https://www.wharfedaleobserver.co.uk/resources/images/13710036/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:57'}

As more children under 12 years old get vaccinated, CDC will be able to analyze and share those data,” the CDC says.\n\nWill there be a choice of vaccines?\n\nThe final decision on which vaccine will be available for this age group in India will be recommended by the government. For instance, the government allows only Corbevax to be administered to those in the 12-14 age group, and only Covaxin to those in the 15-18 age group. The Zydus Cadila DNA vaccine, which has been approved for children aged 12 and above, has not been used in the vaccination drive so far.\n\nWhat is the efficacy and safety profile of these vaccines?\n\nOn Tuesday, Bharat Biotech, which is conducting one of the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine trials to generate data in the 2-18 year age group, said neutralising antibodies in these children were 1.7 times higher than in adults. “Covaxin exhibits robust immune responses in children with 2 doses and 6 months follow up, indicating durability of immune responses. Data was presented to the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation) Subject Expert Committee and will be published in the weeks to come,” Bharat Biotech said.\n\nLast September, Biological E received approval to conduct phase 2/3 trials with Corbevax in children and adolescents aged 5-18. After getting a no-objection certificate, the company initiated the study in October 2021 (which is ongoing), and has evaluated safety and immunogenicity results. The company said the data indicates that the vaccine is safe and immunogenic.', 'image': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/04/covid-vaccine-1.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:58:42'}

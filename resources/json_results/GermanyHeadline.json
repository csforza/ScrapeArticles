        "text": "Nuclear threat and World War III, new attacks and casualties, more aid to Kyiv. Here are the highlights of events in Ukraine over the past 24 hours:\n\nFive victims of attacks on railway stations\n\nAt least five people have been killed and 18 injured in Russian missile strikes at five railway stations in central Ukraine's Vinnytsia region, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office said.\n\nThe US wants a \"weakened\" Russia\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hopes the war in Ukraine will make it difficult for the Russian military. \"We want to see Russia weakened to the point that it cannot do the things it did during the invasion of Ukraine,\" he said after a visit to Kyiv with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Ukraine can win the war if it has the \"right equipment\", he added.\n\nAustin and Blinken pledged 0 million in additional military aid during their visit.\n\nRussia warns of real danger from World War III\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has warned that there is a \"real\" danger of an outbreak of World War III as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. \"The danger is serious, it's real, you can't underestimate it,\" he told Interfax.\n\nPeace talks to continue\n\nPeace talks with Ukraine will continue, Lavrov added. He criticized Kyiv's approach to the talks and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of \"pretending\" to negotiate. \"Goodwill has its limits. But if it is not reciprocal, it does not help the negotiation process,\" he said.\n\nUS ambassadors and consuls will return to Kyiv\n\nBlinken confirmed that US diplomats withdrawn from Ukraine at the start of the Russian invasion would gradually return to Kyiv. US President Joe Biden has nominated Foreign Service Officer Bridget Brink as the next US ambassador.\n\nSeveral European countries have also reopened their embassies in Kyiv after Russia withdrew its troops from the region.\n\nThere is no deal for Mariupol\n\nThe Russian military says Kyiv has prevented the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, where Ukrainian forces have barricaded themselves in the besieged port city, despite announcing a unilateral ceasefire. According to Ukraine, however, Moscow has not agreed to its request to evacuate wounded soldiers and civilians.\n\nPutin congratulated Macron\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron on his victory over far-right candidate Marin Le Pen, who is considered closer to Moscow.\n\nICC joins investigation into crimes in Ukraine\n\nThe Attorney General of the International Criminal Court will join the EU investigation team to investigate possible international crimes committed in Ukraine. This is the first time that its representatives have participated in a joint international investigation.\n\nExpelled German diplomats\n\nMoscow expelled 40 German diplomats after Berlin declared 40 Russian diplomats persona non grata earlier this month.\n\nBritish missiles against Russia\n\nThe Minister of Defense of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace assured that London will send to Ukraine armored vehicles that can fire missiles at Russian warplanes.\n\nRussia claims to have shot down Ukrainian drones\n\nThe governor of Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, said Russian forces had shot down two Ukrainian drones near the border between the two countries, in the Rylsk region of Kursk. Two people were injured in a village in Russia's Belgorod region as a result of Ukrainian strikes, the village mayor said.\n\n5.2 million refugees\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled their country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago. More than 45,000 have left in the last 24 hours, the UN said.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\n\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 - Novinite.bg\n\n/BGNES",

The ministry noted it was \u201ca symmetrical response\u201d to the German Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock\u2019s decision to expel 40 Russian diplomats from Germany by the beginning of April.\n\n\u201cThe government has therefore decided today to declare undesirable a significant number of members of the Russian embassy who have worked here in Germany every day against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society,\u201d Baerbock had stated.\n\nThis decision was announced after a mass grave of hundreds of corpses was found near Kyiv. More specifically, authorities have concluded that victims were civilians who were fatally shot or simply executed, with the majority being abandoned in the streets or given temporary graves.\n\nAlthough expected, today\u2019s decision isn\u2019t justified, as the German Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Baerbock also once again reinstated that the expelled diplomats, in fact, represented a threat to 300,000 Ukrainians living in the country, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\n\u201cThe 40 members of the Russian missions in Germany whom we expelled three weeks ago had not worked as diplomats for one single day while in Germany. Rather, these individuals had striven systematically for years to undermine our freedom and cohesion in our society,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nOn the other hand, as the press release reads, the German diplomats in Russia \u2018have done nothing wrong, despite the unusual circumstances there.\n\nThe statement is concluded with the Minister\u2019s dedication to providing support for the staff members affected and their families with all the challenges this decision brings for them.\n\nThe Russian government has also declared \u2018persona non-grata\u2019 several people working in the Estonian embassy and closing consulates in St. Petersburg and Pskov.\n\n\u201cEstonia made its decisions in coordination with our allies. According to public data, a total of 480 Russian embassy staff have been deported by NATO and EU member states since February 24, in addition to which Japan has deported eight Russian embassy staff,\u201d the statement issued by Estonia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reads.\n\nAccording to data from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), about 3,455 civilians have died since the war broke on February 24.\n\n>> Ukrainian Officials Criticize Austria\u2019s MFA for Opposing Ukraine\u2019s Membership in EU",

We are negotiating, we do not reject [talks],\" Putin said.\n\nHe, however, added Russia could not give Ukraine security guarantees without resolving territorial issues in Crimea and separatist territories in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously said that a future nationwide referendum would be held to decide those issues.\n\nGuterres called for a cease-fire, and urged Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians trapped at a giant steel mill in Mariupol surrounded by the Russian forces.\n\nPutin said he was open to the UN and Red Cross evacuating civilians from the plant, but claimed Ukrainian forces were using civilians as shields and not allowing them to leave.\n\nGuterres is expected to visit Kyiv on Thursday to meet with Zelenskyy and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 00:12 Vladimir Putin: We are negotiating, we don't reject talks.\n\nKyiv pulls down Soviet-era monument of brotherhood\n\nAuthorities in Kyiv dismantled a Soviet-era monument, which symbolized friendship between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\"It took some effort but the Soviet sculpture of the two workers, symbolizing the reunification of Ukraine and Russia, was dismantled this evening,\" Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko says in a statement on social media.\n\nThe statue depicted a Ukrainian and Russian worker on a plinth, holding aloft together a Soviet order of friendship. It was erected in 1982 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Union.\n\n\"This monument ... symbolized friendship between Ukrainian and Russian nations. We now see what this 'friendship' is destruction of Ukrainian cities, ruining the lives of Ukrainians, killing tens of thousands of peaceful people. I am convinced such a monument has an entirely different meaning now,\" Klitschko said.\n\nSummary of Tuesday's events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nAfter weeks of mounting pressure, the German government said it would send heavy weapons to Ukraine. German Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht pledged to provide Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns during a speech at the US defense conference on Ukraine.\n\nPolish and Bulgarian officials have said that Russia's Gazprom has threatened to cut gas supplies starting Wednesday. The suspensions would be the first since Russia insisted foreign buyers pay for gas in rubles. Meanwhile, German Economy and Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck said his country hopes to find an alternative to Russian oil imports in the \"coming days.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has agreed \"in principle\" to allow international groups to help evacuate civilians from Mariupol, the United Nations said. The UN said Putin made the concession to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting in Moscow.\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN atomic watchdog Rafael Grossi decried as \"very, very dangerous\" Russia's temporary occupation of the Chornobyl nuclear plant. The IAEA offered to help Ukraine repair damage caused to the stricken plant.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says the war in Ukraine has already weakened Russia's military capability. Speaking after meeting allies and partners at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, he said since the invasion started, Russia's land forces have sustained \"pretty substantial'' casualties, as well as lost a lot of equipment and used a lot of precision-guided munitions.\n\nWatch video 25:59 The Day with Phil Gayle: Diplomacy & Dialog\n\nYou can revisit our live updates from April 26 here.\n\nlo/wmr (AP,AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

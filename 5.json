            "text": "Denmark: Three hepatitis cases reported in children\n\nNewsDesk @bactiman63\n\nThe Statens Serum Institut reported this week at present, cases of hepatitis without a known cause are seen in children in a number of countries in the world \u2013 including Denmark. Three cases have been seen here since December.\n\n\u201cIt is more than we would expect. All children have been hospitalized and several have been seriously ill, but fortunately none of them have needed a liver transplant \u201c, says chief physician Anders Koch from the Statens Serum Institut (SSI).\n\nThe Danish health authorities have now launched an extended monitoring of the unexplained cases.\n\n\u201cNormally we keep an eye on hepatitis caused by certain viruses \u2013 for example hepatitis A. But now we have some children with liver damage, which we do not really know what is causing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, we have now expanded the monitoring, so that the National Board of Health and SSI together with the pediatricians \u2013 including not least the pediatricians \u2013 keep an eye on and register such cases,\u201d says Anders Koch.\n\nSubscribe to Outbreak News TV on YouTube\n\nAlthough SSI is aware of the situation both in Denmark and internationally and is following developments closely, Anders Koch does not believe that there is cause for concern.\n\n\u201cEven if it is a specific cause and not sporadic cases, the risk of the individual child being affected by this rare form of hepatitis is still incredibly small.\u201d\n\nAs a parent, you must behave as you usually do when your child becomes ill and seek medical attention if you are worried about the child\u2019s condition. The typical, obvious symptoms of hepatitis are whitish stools, very dark urine and yellowing of the eyes and skin. Before that, you will typically have pronounced fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain or muscle and joint pain \u201c, says Anders Koch.\n\nLooking for the cause\n\nAt the same time, people continue to look for the cause of the unexplained cases of hepatitis.\n\nHere, England has taken the lead because most cases so far have been registered here. But the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is also working to find the cause.\n\nThe investigation work also takes place in the individual countries. In Denmark at the pediatricians in collaboration with the National Board of Health and SSI.\n\nUK update: 34 additional sudden onset hepatitis cases in children reported\n\nAcute hepatitis of unknown origin cases reported in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain\n\nIsrael the latest country to report cases of children with acute hepatitis for an unknown reason\n\nAlabama investigates Adenovirus infections in young children\n\n\n\n",

The newspaper also said that Javid compared the political sensitivities over gender dysphoria to the claims of racism that accompanied revelations of grooming of children in Rotherham.\n\nHowever, there were calls yesterday for Javid to avoid \u201cscaremongering\u201d over gender dysphoria. Gids is based within the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, with clinics in London, Leeds and Bristol. The service says it is very rare for patients to later regret taking puberty-blockers and less-reversible hormone treatments, but other experts say that there are no comprehensive studies on the issue.\n\nDavid Bell, a former consultant psychiatrist and staff governor at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust who has raised concerns about treatment at Gids, said: \u201cThere has been no follow-up of the patients, so there is no data. As Javid has said, we need to find out what happens to these children.\n\n\u201cHe likens it to the situation in Rotherham, which at first seems a strange comparison to make. But when one thinks about it, he has made an important point.\n\n\u201cThe comparison here is that fears of being seen as transphobic, like fears of being seen as racist, have certainly interfered with the capacity of professionals to properly investigate this phenomenon.\u201d\n\nFears of being seen as transphobic, like fears of being seen as racist, have interfered with the capacity of professionals to properly investigate this phenomenon David Bell, psychiatrist\n\nLui Asquith, director of legal and policy at the transgender and gender-variant charity Mermaids, said affirmative care was \u201cnot at odds with exploration and that exploration should always be without expectation\u201d.\n\nThey added: \u201cSome young people are trans, and some of them need puberty blockers to be comfortable and able to engage properly in life. That process needs to be informed and timely \u2013 just as you\u2019d expect with any area of healthcare. Scaremongering around trans healthcare is unhelpful and, instead, we call for understanding and respect.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from the charity Stonewall said: \u201cWhat is important is that children and young people are listened to and that they are at the heart of decision-making, supported by their families and clinicians. These treatments must be based on the best possible data, and draw from global medical expertise and consensus rather than rhetoric or fearmongering. The Cass review is an in-depth, expert-led review that is already well under way and due to report later in the year, and so an additional review would be an unnecessary, kneejerk intervention.\u201d\n\nLabour sources suggested that the government was effectively re-announcing an inquiry that was already progressing. Senior figures said the government was trying to use \u201cculture war\u201d issues to distract from the rising cost of living and questions around Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership.\n\nA spokesperson for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said: \u201cWe agree that support should be holistic, based on the best available evidence, and that no assumptions should be made about the right outcome for any given young person. At Gids, we take a young person\u2019s sense of themselves seriously. Some may refer to this approach as \u2018affirmative\u2019. However, being respectful of someone\u2019s identity does not preclude exploration.\u201d",

It is not yet clear if there has been an increase in hepatitis cases, or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected. While adenovirus is a possible hypothesis, investigations are ongoing for the causative agent.\n\nOutbreak overview\n\nAs of 21 April 2022, at least 169 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin have been reported from 11 countries in the WHO European Region and one country in the WHO Region of the Americas (Figure 1). Cases have been reported in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom) (114), Spain (13), Israel (12), the United States of America (9), Denmark (6), Ireland (<5), The Netherlands (4), Italy (4), Norway (2), France (2), Romania (1), and Belgium (1).\n\nFigure 1. Distribution of cases of acute severe hepatitis of unknown origin by country, as of 23 April 2022.\n\nCases are aged 1 month to 16 years old. Seventeen children (approximately 10%) have required liver transplantation; at least one death has been reported.\n\nThe clinical syndrome among identified cases is acute hepatitis (liver inflammation) with markedly elevated liver enzymes. Many cases reported gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting preceding presentation with severe acute hepatitis, and increased levels of liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) greater the 500 IU/L) and jaundice. Most cases did not have a fever. The common viruses that cause acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E) have not been detected in any of these cases. International travel or links to other countries based on the currently available information have not been identified as factors.\n\nAdenovirus has been detected in at least 74 cases, and of the number of cases with information on molecular testing, 18 have been identified as F type 41. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 20 cases of those that were tested. Furthermore, 19 were detected with a SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus co-infection.\n\nThe United Kingdom, where the majority of cases have been reported to date, has recently observed a significant increase in adenovirus infections in the community (particularly detected in faecal samples in children) following low levels of circulation earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Netherlands also reported concurrent increasing community adenovirus circulation.\n\nNevertheless, due to enhanced laboratory testing for adenovirus, this could represent the identification of an existing rare outcome occurring at levels not previously detected that is now being recognized due to increased testing.",

            "text": "Credit: Unsplash\n\nA case of a mysterious acute variant of hepatitis in children, which has been detected in a number of countries in recent weeks, has now also been discovered in Belgium, reports the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nThe disease was found in a 10-year-old child in Belgium. The cause is still unknown.\n\n\u201cIt is not yet clear if there has been an increase in hepatitis cases, or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected,\u201d the WHO said in a statement.\n\nWorldwide, at least 169 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin have been reported. Cases have been reported in the United Kingdom (114), Spain (13), Israel (12), the United States (9), Denmark (6), Ireland (fewer than 5), The Netherlands (4), Italy (4), Norway (2), France (2), Romania (1), and now one in Belgium as well.\n\nAll patients are aged between one month and 16 years old, and showed symptoms such as jaundice, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Approximately 10% (17 children) have required liver transplantation, and at least one child has died.\n\nAside from the age of the Belgian patient, there is no more information available about the case at the moment, but virologist for the Sciensano national health institute Steven Van Gucht is not surprised that the disease has reached Belgium.\n\n\u201cI think that in the coming days or weeks new possible cases will surface,\u201d he told VRT. \u201cWe have now also distributed an alert to doctors and specialists that they should report possible cases. Every year, there are dozens of cases of acute liver inflammation, including in children, so in itself, it is not that unusual.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly is hepatitis?\n\nHepatitis is the term used to describe inflammation of the liver. Among other things, the liver is responsible for processing nutrients, breaking down toxic substances and supporting immunity. Hepatitis is usually caused by a virus or the result of liver damage caused by drinking alcohol.\n\nThere are different forms of hepatitis, named after the virus variant that causes the form (A, B, C, D and E). The cause of this new mysterious hepatitis is not yet known, but researchers are certain that it is not one of the usual hepatitis viruses (A to E).\n\nMany people are carriers of the hepatitis virus without knowing it, as it can sometimes take a long time before someone develops symptoms. An infection is acute if it lasts less than six months. If an infection lasts longer, it is called chronic hepatitis.\n\n\u201cHepatitis is always an inflammation of the liver cells,\u201d said liver specialist Hans Van Vlierberghe of Ghent University Hospital (UZ Gent). \u201cThat is always the same in any form, whether you have it because of a virus, obesity, alcohol or a strange reaction to a medication. Here, however, we do not know what the cause is.\u201d\n\nRelated News:\n\nHe stressed that, as long as the cause has not been identified, effectively treating the disease is a lot more difficult. \u201cWith treatment, you want to remove the cause. But if you do not know what it is, it is obviously difficult to treat. What we do then, is treat the symptoms.\u201d\n\nWhile the WHO mentioned the adenovirus as a possible cause of the disease, the organisation also stressed that \u201cinvestigations are ongoing for the causative agent.\u201d\n\nAdenoviruses are common viruses that cause a range of illnesses. They are widespread and regularly cause infectious diseases in all age groups, causing cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, bronchitis, pneumonia and/or diarrhoea, among others.\n\nThere are many different types of adenoviruses, so people can get infected more than once. Infections are rarely serious, and most children have had at least one adenovirus infection before age 10. Additionally, these viruses do not have a \u201cseason\u201d like other viruses (such as the flu), meaning infections can happen at any time of the year.\n\n\u2018Too early to be worried\u2019\n\nSo far, 74 of the identified hepatitis cases have tested positive for that adenovirus. \u201cThe patient in our country also had the adenovirus in their stool,\u201d said Van Gucht. \u201cBut adenoviruses are very common in children so we do not know if it is the cause here.\u201d\n\nStill, an infection with the adenovirus has never before led to hepatitis in healthy children, he added. Therefore, the WHO is looking into increased susceptibility due to a lower circulation of adenoviruses during the coronavirus pandemic, the emergence of a new adenovirus or a combination with an infection with the coronavirus as potential causes.\n\nAdditionally, no potential link with any of the Covid-19 vaccines was found, and no other epidemiological risk factor, such as a recent trip abroad, has been identified so far either. \u201cWe do not know if a common cause exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is still completely in the research phase,\u201d Van Gucht said. \u201cThere are many questions and few answers. That does not mean that you should not take it seriously and investigate it properly, but it is still very early to be worried about it. Perhaps it is not necessary at all.\u201d",

A COVID-19 infection was identified in 20 of those tested and 19 cases were detected with a COVID-19 and adenovirus co-infection, it said.After the cases were reported, public health officials in the US and the UK announced that they had launched an investigation into cases of the severe acute hepatitis in children.Although no case has been reported in China, this information has gripped the nerves of the Chinese public, who fear that when the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak is yet to ebb away, such an outbreak of hepatitis may lead the outbreak into uncharted territory.Scientists worldwide believe more studies are needed to look into the connection between Sars-CoV-2 and the strain of severe hepatitis.Public Health Scotland's director, Jim McMenamin, told Reuters that work is under way to understand if an adenovirus has mutated to cause more severe disease, or if it could be causing the problems with another virus, including possibly Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Any link to COVID-19 vaccines has been ruled out, as the vast majority of children who have fallen ill were not vaccinated, according to the WHO.Guangzhou-based medical expert Zhuang Shilihe disagreed with those claims of a \"direct link\" between the hepatitis and Sars-CoV-2, as well as the COVID-19 vaccines, as there's no scientific evidence pointing that way.But Zhuang believed it is possible that infection with Omicron, the latest dominant variant of Sars-CoV-2, has made the symptoms of the hepatitis more severe, as Sars-CoV-2 wreaks havoc on the human immune system.Lu Hongzhou, head of Shenzhen's anti-epidemic expert team and head of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, told the Global Times that \"under normal circumstances, infection by an adenovirus won't lead to severe hepatitis.\"However, Lu also pointed out that people with weak immune systems can suffer severe consequences from an infection by an adenovirus. Especially among patients who have undergone organ transplants, an adenovirus can cause serious respiratory tract infection, as well as viral pneumonia.People of all ages are easily prone to adenovirus infections, yet children with weaker immune systems are even more vulnerable to such a virus, according to Lu.Epidemiologists believe China's current zero-COVID policy has provided a shelter for the vulnerable group, so that the under-aged group is currently less exposed to further dangers like the unknown hepatitis.Zhuang urged relevant institutes to pay special attention to epidemiological surveillance, so that if such cases of hepatitis occur, they should report this and transfer the cases to hospitals with better conditions.",

Gids is based within the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, with clinics in London, Leeds and Bristol.

But when one thinks about it, he has made an important point.\n\n\u201cThe comparison here is that fears of being seen as transphobic, like fears of being seen as racist, have certainly interfered with the capacity of professionals to properly investigate this phenomenon.\u201d\n\nFears of being seen as transphobic, like fears of being seen as racist, have interfered with the capacity of professionals to properly investigate this phenomenon David Bell, psychiatrist\n\nLui Asquith, director of legal and policy at the transgender and gender-variant charity Mermaids, said affirmative care was \u201cnot at odds with exploration and that exploration should always be without expectation\u201d.\n\nThey added: \u201cSome young people are trans, and some of them need puberty blockers to be comfortable and able to engage properly in life. That process needs to be informed and timely \u2013 just as you\u2019d expect with any area of healthcare. Scaremongering around trans healthcare is unhelpful and, instead, we call for understanding and respect.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from the charity Stonewall said: \u201cWhat is important is that children and young people are listened to and that they are at the heart of decision-making, supported by their families and clinicians. These treatments must be based on the best possible data, and draw from global medical expertise and consensus rather than rhetoric or fearmongering. The Cass review is an in-depth, expert-led review that is already well under way and due to report later in the year, and so an additional review would be an unnecessary, kneejerk intervention.\u201d\n\nLabour sources suggested that the government was effectively re-announcing an inquiry that was already progressing. Senior figures said the government was trying to use \u201cculture war\u201d issues to distract from the rising cost of living and questions around Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership.\n\nA spokesperson for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said: \u201cWe agree that support should be holistic, based on the best available evidence, and that no assumptions should be made about the right outcome for any given young person. At Gids, we take a young person\u2019s sense of themselves seriously. Some may refer to this approach as \u2018affirmative\u2019. However, being respectful of someone\u2019s identity does not preclude exploration.\u201d",

It is not yet clear if there has been an increase in hepatitis cases, or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected. While adenovirus is a possible hypothesis, investigations are ongoing for the causative agent.\n\nOutbreak overview\n\nAs of 21 April 2022, at least 169 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin have been reported from 11 countries in the WHO European Region and one country in the WHO Region of the Americas (Figure 1). Cases have been reported in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom) (114), Spain (13), Israel (12), the United States of America (9), Denmark (6), Ireland (<5), The Netherlands (4), Italy (4), Norway (2), France (2), Romania (1), and Belgium (1).\n\nFigure 1. Distribution of cases of acute severe hepatitis of unknown origin by country, as of 23 April 2022.\n\nCases are aged 1 month to 16 years old. Seventeen children (approximately 10%) have required liver transplantation; at least one death has been reported.\n\nThe clinical syndrome among identified cases is acute hepatitis (liver inflammation) with markedly elevated liver enzymes. Many cases reported gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting preceding presentation with severe acute hepatitis, and increased levels of liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) greater the 500 IU/L) and jaundice. Most cases did not have a fever. The common viruses that cause acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E) have not been detected in any of these cases. International travel or links to other countries based on the currently available information have not been identified as factors.\n\nAdenovirus has been detected in at least 74 cases, and of the number of cases with information on molecular testing, 18 have been identified as F type 41. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 20 cases of those that were tested. Furthermore, 19 were detected with a SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus co-infection.\n\nThe United Kingdom, where the majority of cases have been reported to date, has recently observed a significant increase in adenovirus infections in the community (particularly detected in faecal samples in children) following low levels of circulation earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Netherlands also reported concurrent increasing community adenovirus circulation.\n\nNevertheless, due to enhanced laboratory testing for adenovirus, this could represent the identification of an existing rare outcome occurring at levels not previously detected that is now being recognized due to increased testing.",

Cases have been reported in the United Kingdom (114), Spain (13), Israel (12), the United States (9), Denmark (6), Ireland (fewer than 5), The Netherlands (4), Italy (4), Norway (2), France (2), Romania (1), and now one in Belgium as well.\n\nAll patients are aged between one month and 16 years old, and showed symptoms such as jaundice, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Approximately 10% (17 children) have required liver transplantation, and at least one child has died.\n\nAside from the age of the Belgian patient, there is no more information available about the case at the moment, but virologist for the Sciensano national health institute Steven Van Gucht is not surprised that the disease has reached Belgium.\n\n\u201cI think that in the coming days or weeks new possible cases will surface,\u201d he told VRT. \u201cWe have now also distributed an alert to doctors and specialists that they should report possible cases. Every year, there are dozens of cases of acute liver inflammation, including in children, so in itself, it is not that unusual.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly is hepatitis?\n\nHepatitis is the term used to describe inflammation of the liver. Among other things, the liver is responsible for processing nutrients, breaking down toxic substances and supporting immunity. Hepatitis is usually caused by a virus or the result of liver damage caused by drinking alcohol.\n\nThere are different forms of hepatitis, named after the virus variant that causes the form (A, B, C, D and E). The cause of this new mysterious hepatitis is not yet known, but researchers are certain that it is not one of the usual hepatitis viruses (A to E).\n\nMany people are carriers of the hepatitis virus without knowing it, as it can sometimes take a long time before someone develops symptoms. An infection is acute if it lasts less than six months. If an infection lasts longer, it is called chronic hepatitis.\n\n\u201cHepatitis is always an inflammation of the liver cells,\u201d said liver specialist Hans Van Vlierberghe of Ghent University Hospital (UZ Gent). \u201cThat is always the same in any form, whether you have it because of a virus, obesity, alcohol or a strange reaction to a medication. Here, however, we do not know what the cause is.\u201d\n\nRelated News:\n\nHe stressed that, as long as the cause has not been identified, effectively treating the disease is a lot more difficult. \u201cWith treatment, you want to remove the cause. But if you do not know what it is, it is obviously difficult to treat. What we do then, is treat the symptoms.\u201d\n\nWhile the WHO mentioned the adenovirus as a possible cause of the disease, the organisation also stressed that \u201cinvestigations are ongoing for the causative agent.\u201d\n\nAdenoviruses are common viruses that cause a range of illnesses. They are widespread and regularly cause infectious diseases in all age groups, causing cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, bronchitis, pneumonia and/or diarrhoea, among others.\n\nThere are many different types of adenoviruses, so people can get infected more than once. Infections are rarely serious, and most children have had at least one adenovirus infection before age 10. Additionally, these viruses do not have a \u201cseason\u201d like other viruses (such as the flu), meaning infections can happen at any time of the year.\n\n\u2018Too early to be worried\u2019\n\nSo far, 74 of the identified hepatitis cases have tested positive for that adenovirus. \u201cThe patient in our country also had the adenovirus in their stool,\u201d said Van Gucht. \u201cBut adenoviruses are very common in children so we do not know if it is the cause here.\u201d\n\nStill, an infection with the adenovirus has never before led to hepatitis in healthy children, he added. Therefore, the WHO is looking into increased susceptibility due to a lower circulation of adenoviruses during the coronavirus pandemic, the emergence of a new adenovirus or a combination with an infection with the coronavirus as potential causes.\n\nAdditionally, no potential link with any of the Covid-19 vaccines was found, and no other epidemiological risk factor, such as a recent trip abroad, has been identified so far either. \u201cWe do not know if a common cause exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is still completely in the research phase,\u201d Van Gucht said. \u201cThere are many questions and few answers. That does not mean that you should not take it seriously and investigate it properly, but it is still very early to be worried about it. Perhaps it is not necessary at all.\u201d",

Of these, 17 became so sick they needed liver transplants.The WHO also said that a common cold virus known as an adenovirus had been detected in at least 74 cases. A COVID-19 infection was identified in 20 of those tested and 19 cases were detected with a COVID-19 and adenovirus co-infection, it said.After the cases were reported, public health officials in the US and the UK announced that they had launched an investigation into cases of the severe acute hepatitis in children.Although no case has been reported in China, this information has gripped the nerves of the Chinese public, who fear that when the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak is yet to ebb away, such an outbreak of hepatitis may lead the outbreak into uncharted territory.Scientists worldwide believe more studies are needed to look into the connection between Sars-CoV-2 and the strain of severe hepatitis.Public Health Scotland's director, Jim McMenamin, told Reuters that work is under way to understand if an adenovirus has mutated to cause more severe disease, or if it could be causing the problems with another virus, including possibly Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Any link to COVID-19 vaccines has been ruled out, as the vast majority of children who have fallen ill were not vaccinated, according to the WHO.Guangzhou-based medical expert Zhuang Shilihe disagreed with those claims of a \"direct link\" between the hepatitis and Sars-CoV-2, as well as the COVID-19 vaccines, as there's no scientific evidence pointing that way.But Zhuang believed it is possible that infection with Omicron, the latest dominant variant of Sars-CoV-2, has made the symptoms of the hepatitis more severe, as Sars-CoV-2 wreaks havoc on the human immune system.Lu Hongzhou, head of Shenzhen's anti-epidemic expert team and head of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, told the Global Times that \"under normal circumstances, infection by an adenovirus won't lead to severe hepatitis.\"However, Lu also pointed out that people with weak immune systems can suffer severe consequences from an infection by an adenovirus. Especially among patients who have undergone organ transplants, an adenovirus can cause serious respiratory tract infection, as well as viral pneumonia.People of all ages are easily prone to adenovirus infections, yet children with weaker immune systems are even more vulnerable to such a virus, according to Lu.Epidemiologists believe China's current zero-COVID policy has provided a shelter for the vulnerable group, so that the under-aged group is currently less exposed to further dangers like the unknown hepatitis.Zhuang urged relevant institutes to pay special attention to epidemiological surveillance, so that if such cases of hepatitis occur, they should report this and transfer the cases to hospitals with better conditions.",

It is not yet clear if there has been an increase in hepatitis cases, or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected. While adenovirus is a possible hypothesis, investigations are ongoing for the causative agent.\n\nOutbreak overview\n\nAs of 21 April 2022, at least 169 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin have been reported from 11 countries in the WHO European Region and one country in the WHO Region of the Americas (Figure 1). Cases have been reported in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom) (114), Spain (13), Israel (12), the United States of America (9), Denmark (6), Ireland (<5), The Netherlands (4), Italy (4), Norway (2), France (2), Romania (1), and Belgium (1).\n\nFigure 1. Distribution of cases of acute severe hepatitis of unknown origin by country, as of 23 April 2022.\n\nCases are aged 1 month to 16 years old. Seventeen children (approximately 10%) have required liver transplantation; at least one death has been reported.\n\nThe clinical syndrome among identified cases is acute hepatitis (liver inflammation) with markedly elevated liver enzymes. Many cases reported gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting preceding presentation with severe acute hepatitis, and increased levels of liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) greater the 500 IU/L) and jaundice. Most cases did not have a fever. The common viruses that cause acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E) have not been detected in any of these cases. International travel or links to other countries based on the currently available information have not been identified as factors.\n\nAdenovirus has been detected in at least 74 cases, and of the number of cases with information on molecular testing, 18 have been identified as F type 41. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 20 cases of those that were tested. Furthermore, 19 were detected with a SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus co-infection.\n\nThe United Kingdom, where the majority of cases have been reported to date, has recently observed a significant increase in adenovirus infections in the community (particularly detected in faecal samples in children) following low levels of circulation earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Netherlands also reported concurrent increasing community adenovirus circulation.\n\nNevertheless, due to enhanced laboratory testing for adenovirus, this could represent the identification of an existing rare outcome occurring at levels not previously detected that is now being recognized due to increased testing.",

The cause is still unknown.\n\n\u201cIt is not yet clear if there has been an increase in hepatitis cases, or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected,\u201d the WHO said in a statement.\n\nWorldwide, at least 169 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin have been reported. Cases have been reported in the United Kingdom (114), Spain (13), Israel (12), the United States (9), Denmark (6), Ireland (fewer than 5), The Netherlands (4), Italy (4), Norway (2), France (2), Romania (1), and now one in Belgium as well.\n\nAll patients are aged between one month and 16 years old, and showed symptoms such as jaundice, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Approximately 10% (17 children) have required liver transplantation, and at least one child has died.\n\nAside from the age of the Belgian patient, there is no more information available about the case at the moment, but virologist for the Sciensano national health institute Steven Van Gucht is not surprised that the disease has reached Belgium.\n\n\u201cI think that in the coming days or weeks new possible cases will surface,\u201d he told VRT. \u201cWe have now also distributed an alert to doctors and specialists that they should report possible cases. Every year, there are dozens of cases of acute liver inflammation, including in children, so in itself, it is not that unusual.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly is hepatitis?\n\nHepatitis is the term used to describe inflammation of the liver. Among other things, the liver is responsible for processing nutrients, breaking down toxic substances and supporting immunity. Hepatitis is usually caused by a virus or the result of liver damage caused by drinking alcohol.\n\nThere are different forms of hepatitis, named after the virus variant that causes the form (A, B, C, D and E). The cause of this new mysterious hepatitis is not yet known, but researchers are certain that it is not one of the usual hepatitis viruses (A to E).\n\nMany people are carriers of the hepatitis virus without knowing it, as it can sometimes take a long time before someone develops symptoms. An infection is acute if it lasts less than six months. If an infection lasts longer, it is called chronic hepatitis.\n\n\u201cHepatitis is always an inflammation of the liver cells,\u201d said liver specialist Hans Van Vlierberghe of Ghent University Hospital (UZ Gent). \u201cThat is always the same in any form, whether you have it because of a virus, obesity, alcohol or a strange reaction to a medication. Here, however, we do not know what the cause is.\u201d\n\nRelated News:\n\nHe stressed that, as long as the cause has not been identified, effectively treating the disease is a lot more difficult. \u201cWith treatment, you want to remove the cause. But if you do not know what it is, it is obviously difficult to treat. What we do then, is treat the symptoms.\u201d\n\nWhile the WHO mentioned the adenovirus as a possible cause of the disease, the organisation also stressed that \u201cinvestigations are ongoing for the causative agent.\u201d\n\nAdenoviruses are common viruses that cause a range of illnesses. They are widespread and regularly cause infectious diseases in all age groups, causing cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, bronchitis, pneumonia and/or diarrhoea, among others.\n\nThere are many different types of adenoviruses, so people can get infected more than once. Infections are rarely serious, and most children have had at least one adenovirus infection before age 10. Additionally, these viruses do not have a \u201cseason\u201d like other viruses (such as the flu), meaning infections can happen at any time of the year.\n\n\u2018Too early to be worried\u2019\n\nSo far, 74 of the identified hepatitis cases have tested positive for that adenovirus. \u201cThe patient in our country also had the adenovirus in their stool,\u201d said Van Gucht. \u201cBut adenoviruses are very common in children so we do not know if it is the cause here.\u201d\n\nStill, an infection with the adenovirus has never before led to hepatitis in healthy children, he added. Therefore, the WHO is looking into increased susceptibility due to a lower circulation of adenoviruses during the coronavirus pandemic, the emergence of a new adenovirus or a combination with an infection with the coronavirus as potential causes.\n\nAdditionally, no potential link with any of the Covid-19 vaccines was found, and no other epidemiological risk factor, such as a recent trip abroad, has been identified so far either. \u201cWe do not know if a common cause exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is still completely in the research phase,\u201d Van Gucht said. \u201cThere are many questions and few answers. That does not mean that you should not take it seriously and investigate it properly, but it is still very early to be worried about it. Perhaps it is not necessary at all.\u201d",

Of these, 17 became so sick they needed liver transplants.The WHO also said that a common cold virus known as an adenovirus had been detected in at least 74 cases. A COVID-19 infection was identified in 20 of those tested and 19 cases were detected with a COVID-19 and adenovirus co-infection, it said.After the cases were reported, public health officials in the US and the UK announced that they had launched an investigation into cases of the severe acute hepatitis in children.Although no case has been reported in China, this information has gripped the nerves of the Chinese public, who fear that when the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak is yet to ebb away, such an outbreak of hepatitis may lead the outbreak into uncharted territory.Scientists worldwide believe more studies are needed to look into the connection between Sars-CoV-2 and the strain of severe hepatitis.Public Health Scotland's director, Jim McMenamin, told Reuters that work is under way to understand if an adenovirus has mutated to cause more severe disease, or if it could be causing the problems with another virus, including possibly Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Any link to COVID-19 vaccines has been ruled out, as the vast majority of children who have fallen ill were not vaccinated, according to the WHO.Guangzhou-based medical expert Zhuang Shilihe disagreed with those claims of a \"direct link\" between the hepatitis and Sars-CoV-2, as well as the COVID-19 vaccines, as there's no scientific evidence pointing that way.But Zhuang believed it is possible that infection with Omicron, the latest dominant variant of Sars-CoV-2, has made the symptoms of the hepatitis more severe, as Sars-CoV-2 wreaks havoc on the human immune system.Lu Hongzhou, head of Shenzhen's anti-epidemic expert team and head of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, told the Global Times that \"under normal circumstances, infection by an adenovirus won't lead to severe hepatitis.\"However, Lu also pointed out that people with weak immune systems can suffer severe consequences from an infection by an adenovirus. Especially among patients who have undergone organ transplants, an adenovirus can cause serious respiratory tract infection, as well as viral pneumonia.People of all ages are easily prone to adenovirus infections, yet children with weaker immune systems are even more vulnerable to such a virus, according to Lu.Epidemiologists believe China's current zero-COVID policy has provided a shelter for the vulnerable group, so that the under-aged group is currently less exposed to further dangers like the unknown hepatitis.Zhuang urged relevant institutes to pay special attention to epidemiological surveillance, so that if such cases of hepatitis occur, they should report this and transfer the cases to hospitals with better conditions.",

            "text": "Drums, flutes and the tramp of marching feet resounded across Northern Ireland last week in the latest round of protests against the protocol which imposes checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea as part of the Brexit deal. On Thursday, they paraded in Castlederg, on Friday in east and north Belfast, and on Saturday night they were due in Derry, columns of loyalist order bands, unionist politicians, activists and citizens, marching behind union jacks proclaiming their Britishness.\n\nSuch parades begin before dusk and climax with speeches as night falls, as if to match warnings of creeping political oblivion. Northern Ireland will hold an election for the Stormont assembly on 5 May, which many marchers consider a proxy battle not just for the protocol but Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK. They fear the state\u2019s existence, and with it their culture and identity, is in jeopardy. Promises from Downing Street last week to \u201creform\u201d the protocol and delay border checks did not assuage unease \u2013 unionists feel they have heard it before.\n\nIf polls are accurate Sinn F\u00e9in will emerge as the biggest party, positioning Michelle O\u2019Neill to become first minister and the region\u2019s first nationalist leader. For the protesters this will be an unprecedented affront that could further grease the slide into a united Ireland. Sinn F\u00e9in, after all, seeks to dissolve Northern Ireland. The party shuns even its name, instead referring to \u201cthe north\u201d. The demographics fuel unionist anxiety; Catholics are expected to soon outnumber Protestants.\n\nDefiance pervades the protests, which have rumbled for a year. One of the biggest was held this month in Lurgan, County Armagh. Billed as a show of strength with invitations to 60 bands and more than 10,000 participants, the marchers tramped down roads with royal names typical of towns founded by Protestant settlers in the 17th century.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still under European rule and we\u2019re British citizens,\u201d said Andrew Hamill, in a bowler hat and sash, as drums began to pound. \u201cIt\u2019s the slippery slope to a united Ireland. Anything is possible.\u201d Scott Wilkinson, 25, bedecked in badges commemorating Ulster regiments in the first world war, said Boris Johnson\u2019s government had betrayed their sacrifice. \u201cIt\u2019s like the middle finger to them. They fought so we could be as one.\u201d England, he said, seemed to not care about unionists. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to say goodbye to us even though we want to be part of them. It\u2019s very upsetting.\u201d\n\nAndrew Hamill pictured at an anti-protocol rally and parade in Lurgan. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Observer\n\nAs speakers mounted the podium, temperatures dropped close to freezing. The audience stamped feet for warmth. \u201cOur demand is simple, we want full and equal citizenship within our own country, something that has been denied to us by this protocol,\u201d Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader and MP, told the crowd. \u201cUntil the protocol is removed we will not see a functioning executive at Stormont because democracy must prevail.\u201d\n\nJim Allister, the gravel-voiced leader of Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), a small, rightwing rival to the DUP, said Northern Ireland was marooned from the rest of the UK. \u201cThe choice is simple, we either kill the protocol or it kills the union,\u201d he said. Jamie Bryson, a young loyalist firebrand, called the protocol \u201ca devil\u2019s pit\u201d. Roy Ferguson, president of the Apprentice Boys of Derry, invoked the 1689 siege of Derry when Protestants repelled the Catholic forces of King James II. \u201cTo preserve our faith, to preserve our culture, to preserve our heritage, we must win this battle,\u201d he thundered. \u201cThe blood of our forefathers still flows in the veins of the Ulster Protestant today.\u201d Ferguson surveyed the crowd and jabbed a finger. \u201cThis evening the people of Ulster, the grassroots Protestants, have spoken!\u201d\n\nThe assertion hung in the night air, hollow and ridiculous. The Protestants of Lurgan and the rest of Northern Ireland had indeed spoken, eloquently, by not turning up. Perhaps 1,000 people stood before Ferguson, a small fraction of the envisaged 10,000, and even that would have been a feeble echo of the flag protests a decade ago and the vaster throngs that protested against the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. The Lurgan event might have passed largely unnoticed except for a controversy over a noose drawn on a poster of the Ulster Unionist party leader, Doug Beattie, who boycotts such rallies, deeming them irresponsible rabble-rousing.\n\nEngland is trying to say goodbye to us even though we want to be part of them. It\u2019s very upsetting Scott Wilkinson, unionist\n\nRallies like this have become a familiar ritual, usually drawing between a few dozen and a few hundred people. This does not stop podium orators proclaiming mobilisation and momentum, as if rhetoric alone could conjure multitudes. Their absence reflects a curious phenomenon unfolding within unionism.\n\nNorthern Ireland is on the cusp of an election with potentially momentous implications for the protocol, power-sharing and the Good Friday agreement. Yet jeremiads about the imperilled union draw only paltry crowds. Two realities are playing out simultaneously. Those virulently opposed to the protocol have kept the issue centre-stage with denunciations and, in some cases, threats of violence. Last month an Ulster Volunteer Force bomb hoax forced the evacuation of Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, from an event in Belfast. The Ulster Defence Association, another paramilitary group, said it, too, will target the Irish government. The countdown to a possible Sinn F\u00e9in election breakthrough underscores a perception of Northern Ireland unionists as a lost tribe adrift from history, much like Algeria\u2019s pieds-noirs French settlers.\n\nThis evocative narrative ignores the fact that most pro-union people in Northern Ireland are not marching or suffering existential angst. They may not want the protocol or a united Ireland but neither issue keeps them awake at night. In surveys they express a desire for a stable, functional society and wish their politicians would stop banging on about constitutional issues. They may chafe if O\u2019Neill becomes first minister but are confident Northern Ireland will remain in the UK for the foreseeable future.\n\nTUV leader Jim Allister at Brownlow House following a Loyalist anti-protocol rally and parade in Lurgan. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Observer\n\nThis sentiment came across forcefully in interviews with moderate pro-union voices from different backgrounds. For all the convulsions in unionist politics, they said, the union feels solid. The protocol continues to cause headaches for some companies but ordinary people no longer see the shortages and empty shelves of a year ago, said Linda Ervine, who manages the Turas Irish language project in east Belfast, which is attended mainly by Protestants. \u201cPeople are just getting on with their lives. Nothing terrible has happened. We\u2019re being told continuously that we\u2019re being shoved into a united Ireland, that we\u2019re losing our identity, but we look around and we\u2019re not really seeing it.\u201d\n\nJames Wilson, a County Derry-based researcher and historian who served in the British army, agreed. \u201cThe average punter in Northern Ireland doesn\u2019t see the manifestation of the protocol.\u201d Farmers and business owners were quietly adapting to the protocol\u2019s pros and cons, while ducking out of the region\u2019s polarising politics, he said. \u201cThe protocol is a process to be worked at. Where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way.\u201d A recent Institute of Irish Studies-University of Liverpool/Irish News opinion poll found that unionist voters ranked the economy and health care as priorities ahead of the protocol.\n\nThey can focus on bread-and-butter issues because a referendum on a united Ireland, let alone a vote in favour, seems beyond the horizon. Brexit has not produced a clamour to end partition. The same poll found that just 33.4% of people in Northern Ireland would vote for unification within 15 years. That support fell to a quarter if a united Ireland meant higher taxes or paying for healthcare. This hard-nosed caveat deterred even a fifth of Sinn F\u00e9in voters.\n\nThe poll found that three-quarters of people wanted the next Stormont executive to prioritise jobs, health and welfare over constitutional issues. People are not waking up thinking about Irish unity, O\u2019Neill conceded. Sinn F\u00e9in has duly muted its demands for a border poll and focused on the cost of living and healthcare.\n\nLoyalist activist Jamie Bryson joins TUV Leader Jim Allister and DUP Leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson at Brownlow House in Lurgan. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Observer\n\nThe same poll gave Sinn F\u00e9in 27% of first preference votes, well ahead of the DUP on 20%. The centrist Alliance, which shuns orange and green labels, was third on 11%. Smaller nationalist and unionist parties accounted for most of the rest. \u201cWe have this weird situation where votes for unionist parties are going down but support for the union is stable,\u201d said Peter Shirlow, director of the Institute of Irish Studies. Conversely, Sinn F\u00e9in may make a symbolic electoral breakthrough amid tepid support for a united Ireland.\n\nThere is a disconnect between unionists and unionist parties. Most pro-union voters favour marriage equality and abortion rights, while unionist parties are more socially conservative, said Shirlow. Fewer now seem willing to hold their nose and vote DUP to keep out Sinn F\u00e9in, even if that means getting O\u2019Neill as first minister. They have lost some fear of the republican bogeyman and know that under power-sharing the first minister has identical power to the deputy first minister, a post O\u2019Neill held before, so her elevation would be purely symbolic.\n\nIan Marshall, an Ulster Unionist candidate in County Tyrone who served in the Irish Senate, said a functional executive would help secure the union, no matter who was first minister. \u201cPeople who are pragmatic and who believe Northern Ireland must work will just get on with it. When you\u2019re a democrat you can\u2019t pick and choose. If that\u2019s the will of the people, that\u2019s the will of the people.\u201d\n\nBut this is Northern Ireland. A growing desire to put solution-oriented governance ahead of the constitutional question does not signal an imminent outbreak of political normality. In fact, that desire is likely to get shredded in the buzz-saw of zero-sum tribalism. Most people will still vote for parties that are orange or green, and those parties\u2019 leaders tend to drive power-sharing into a ditch, most recently in February, when the DUP withdrew.\n\nThe 1998 Good Friday agreement locked nationalist and unionist parties into a loveless marriage at Stormont. The DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, in particular, have made a habit of brinkmanship and grandstanding until they find it convenient to walk out, toppling the institutions until negotiating more favourable terms to return. The resulting vacuums have made Stormont synonymous with dysfunction and unaccountability.\n\nLoyalists at an anti-protocol rally in Lurgan. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Observer\n\nAfter votes are counted on 6 May, power-sharing may yet again freeze up. Donaldson has refused to say if the DUP would serve in an executive with a Sinn F\u00e9in first minister, raising the spectre of a stalemate that could cripple Stormont indefinitely, requiring direct rule from London. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the process of emerging from a long, bitter conflict,\u201d said Wilson, the historian. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet a post-conflict society, we\u2019re getting there. You have these jagged edges, it\u2019s not a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nInstead of the doom-laden visions of a \u201cdevil\u2019s pit\u201d, or the shiny hopes of a non-sectarian society, Northern Ireland seems poised to bumble on through its strange limbo, not British enough for some, not Irish enough for others, its eventual destination unclear. It\u2019s messy and unedifying and a damn sight better than the awfulness known as the Troubles.\n\nKey moments in Northern Ireland unionism\n\n1 Unionists formed the Ulster Volunteer Force, a Protestant militia, in the north of Ireland in 1913 to oppose the British government\u2019s promise of self-government for the whole of Ireland.\n\n2 In 1916 the 36th (Ulster) division fought heroically at the Battle of the Somme, earning a place in folklore as embodiments of sacrifice and loyalty to the crown.\n\n3 The Government of Ireland Act 1920 partitioned Ireland. Six north-eastern counties, with an overall Protestant majority, remained in the UK as Northern Ireland. The 26 southern counties eventually became an independent Irish republic.\n\n4 In January 1969 loyalists and RUC officers ambushed and beat civil rights marchers outside Derry, exposing entrenched state sectarianism. The Troubles soon flared.\n\n5 In May 1974 unionist leaders and paramilitaries led a general strike that torpedoed the Sunningdale Agreement\u2019s attempt to create power-sharing with nationalists.\n\n6 In 1985 DUP leader Ian Paisley led massive protests against the Anglo-Irish agreement, which gave the Irish government a role in Northern Ireland. Margaret Thatcher faced down the protests.\n\n7 On 13 October 1994 loyalist paramilitary groups announced a ceasefire, ending a sectarian murder campaign that had killed hundreds of Catholics.\n\n8 In July 1995 Orange Order marchers clashed with police at Drumcree, a test of strength the police eventually won.\n\n9 In 1998 the Ulster Unionist party leader David Trimble persuaded most unionists to back the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n10 In May 2007 Ian Paisley led the DUP into a power-sharing executive with Sinn F\u00e9in.\n\n11 March 2021 loyalist paramilitary groups renounced support for the Good Friday Agreement in protest at the Irish Sea border imposed under the terms of the Brexit deal protocol.",

With Michel, the two are all centrist allies of Macron.\n\nAfter Britain's surprise vote to quit the EU and the election of Donald Trump in the United States in 2016, the bloc was alarmed by Le Pen's potentially explosive social and economic reforms, even if polls showed Macron winning in Sunday's second round.\n\nFrance, a founding member of the EU, has been at the centre of efforts to integrate Europe since the end of World War Two, even if such policies have been divisive.\n\nHaving Le Pen, a deeply eurosceptic politician who has professed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace would have had huge implications for the stability of the EU, analysts and diplomats said.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, although she insisted she had no \"secret agenda\" this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, a French national, offered warm words for the pro-business Macron, saying \"strong leadership is essential in these uncertain times.\"\n\nThe leaders of Sweden, Romania, Lithuania, Finland, the Netherlands, Ireland and Greece, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen all reacted within about half an hour of the result with their congratulations.\n\n\"I look forward to continuing our extensive and constructive cooperation within the EU and NATO, and to further strengthening the excellent relationship between our countries,\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also took to Twitter, \"congratulating\" Macron, saying he looks \"forward to continuing to work together\".\n\nCongratulations to @EmmanuelMacron on your re-election as President of France.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters \"have sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today. I am happy that we will continue our good cooperation\".\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who along with Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is seen as forming a powerful trio of pro-EU leaders, also said the re-election was \"wonderful news for all of Europe\".\n\nMany leaders referred to Macron as \"cher (dear) Emmanuel\".\n\nThe youthful centrist is one of the bloc's most pro-EU leaders, credited by many as having the vision to help it stand up to China's rise and Russia's military threat.\n\nSpain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, tweeted his congratulations to Macron: \"The citizens have chosen a France committed to a free, strong and fair EU. Democracy wins. Europe wins.\" Sanchez on Thursday wrote a joint op-ed in French daily Le Monde with Portugal's Antonio Costa and Scholz criticising Le Pen and urging people to vote for Macron.\n\n\"The chance that there will be pro-European governments in France and Germany for at least the next four years must be seized,\" Anton Hofreiter, chairman of the Europe Committee in the German Bundestag, said.\n\nNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said France had chosen \"liberal democracy over the far-right\". Uniting the French and \"taking courageous decisions for the climate\", were important tasks ahead, he added, calling for closer cooperation in Europe and \"unity against authoritarian forces and war\".\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP and REUTERS)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

It is the first nationwide ceasefire in the past six years in the Middle Eastern country\u2019s deadly civil war, which erupted in 2014. That year, Iranian-backed Houthis seized Sana\u2019a and forced the internationally recognised government into exile. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war in early 2015 to try to restore the government to power.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am\n\n\n\n",

It gained 124,109 votes and 33% of the total vote, the biggest number by far. But given that the boat is \u201ca serious science ship that required the name of a serious scientist\u201d, the vote was overruled. Instead, a small but very advanced yellow submarine on the Sir David Attenborough carries the name Boaty McBoatface.\n\nThe weather forecast for Rothera on Monday is a bracing -2C (28F), and it will feel like -7C, the Met Office said.

There was not any contact between the two sides really.\u201d\n\nAbortion protests have become a hot topic in Scotland with pro life groups targeting medical spaces that conduct the legal procedure.\n\nJane says that Edinburgh Abortion Rights group supports the campaign by Back Off Scotland that calls on the Scottish Government to introduce 150m buffer zones.\n\nShe continued: \u201cAbortion is an essential reproductive healthcare option and a basic human right and we feel that the right to have an abortion safely, legally and locally is not something we should take for granted.\n\n\u201cThere has been a big push in last few years from large groups in US that fund pro life activism all around the world in order to try and diminish access to abortion.\n\n\u201cIt is not getting anywhere in Scotland thankfully but it seems as though their numbers are increasing. We recently saw hundreds outside a hospital in Glasgow protesting outside of a hospital that administered abortions.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still a minority because around 80 per cent of people in Scotland agree that woman should have the right to access an abortion.\n\n\u201cI think, but I cannot prove, that a lot of their funding is coming in from the US but we cannot say where it is going with regards to individual groups.\n\n\u201cYou see the difference in resources with their expensive banners whereas we have home made signs.\n\n\u201cWe feel it is unlikely they could do anything in the present circumstances to overturn the law but we do need to be keeping an eye on them and show there is an alternate presence.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there are anti-choice MSP\u2019s in Scottish parliament does make us squeamish about abortion rights being watered down.\n\n\u201cAs what we want to see is greater protections. We are supporting a bill going through parliament at the moment for buffer zones to be put in place at medical spaces that are offering abortions.\n\n\u201cWe believe people have the right to protest but it is just wrong to intimidate those going for treatment.\n\n\u201cOnce an individual has made her choice, she should be able to go and have an abortion without being harrassed.\u201d\n\nA statement by Abortion Rights Scotland stated that although there is a minority in favour of watering down or removing abortion rights in Scotland, that Scotland should still remain vigilant.\n\nA spokesperson for the organisation said: \u201cThe Abortion Act has been settled law for 55 years and generations of women have been able to take for granted that if they need an abortion, they can have one - safely, legally, locally.\n\n\u201cWhile the majority of people in Scotland accept that only the one who is pregnant can decide if she needs to abort her pregnancy, and she should be able to have an abortion on the NHS, a small minority think that Scotland should be more like certain states in the US where right-wing legislatures have lately been passing extreme abortion bans, sometimes causing all abortion access to be closed down in an entire state.\n\n\u201cDuring the six weeks before Easter, some of these people took part in a US-owned franchise called \"40 Days for Life\", and gathered outside NHS hospitals to protest patient access to reproductive healthcare in Scotland. A private members' bill has been proposed for Holyrood to put a stop to this harassment of patients.\n\n\u201cAbortion was never criminalised in Scotland prior to 1967: while often difficult to access, abortion in Scotland was treated as a private matter between a woman and her doctor.\n\n\u201cThe 1967 Act made abortion more accessible, but also made abortion criminal except under specific circumstances defined by the legislation.\n\n\u201cFifty-four years ago the Abortion Act became law in Scotland. Before the Act turns sixty we should decriminalise abortion completely - Scotland can and should become the first part of the UK where abortion is regulated like any other form of reproductive healthcare.\u201d\n\nIt is not fully known who was behind the organised pro life protest but according to Jane, the \u2018Society for the Protection of Unborn Children\u2019 (SPUC) advertised the event on their site and that several of their banners were spotted at Festival Square.\n\nSPUC have been contacted for comment.",

            "text": "Amal Clooney is a London-based British-Lebanese lawyer, campaigner, and novelist who has a net worth of $50 million. Although she formerly worked at the United Nations and the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, she resigned from the latter post in 2020. As of 2020, she is currently a practising barrister at Doughty Street Chambers. She focuses in international law and human rights. Outside of her professional career, Amal is notable for being the wife of actor George Clooney.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAmal Alamuddin was born on February 3rd of 1978 in Beirut, Lebanon. Amal (whose name means \u201chope\u201d in Arabic) migrated to England with her family when she was two years old, residing in Buckinghamshire. Her family evacuated due of the Lebanese Civil War, however her father ultimately returned to his home country in 1991. She was raised alongside three siblings and attended an all-girls grammar school as a child.\n\nAfter graduating from secondary school, Amal attended St. Hugh\u2019s College in Oxford. After obtaining a number of prizes for academic distinction, she graduated in 2000 with a BA degree in Jurisprudence. She continued her post-secondary study in 2001, attending New York University School of Law to prepare for her LLM degree. During her time studying in New York, she worked under judge Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nCareer\n\nAlamuddin is qualified to practise law in both the United Kingdom and the United States. She was first accepted to the New York bar in 2002, and then to the English and Welsh bars in the following years. International courts in The Hague, such as the International Criminal Court, are among her most notable achievements.\n\nAmal worked as a clerk at the International Court of Justice after working for Sullivan & Cromwell in New York City. She then worked at The Hague for the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor before returning to the United States. Amal returned to the UK in 2010 to practise law as a barrister. Many UN commissions nominated her during this time period. She worked on a number of high-profile cases during this time period. The 2013 Drone Inquiry was among them. While she was representing Julian Assange, she also represented the entire country of Cambodia.\n\nAlamuddin is also a skilled educator, and she served as a visiting faculty member at Columbia Law School\u2019s Human Rights Institute between 2015 and 2016 as part of its Human Rights Institute. She offered courses on human rights, as well as courses on civil and human rights litigation. In addition, Amal has delivered lectures on international criminal law at institutions such as SOAS Law School, The New School, The Hague Academy of International Law, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nA legal action was launched on behalf of the Armenian government in 2015, with the goal of gaining international recognition for the Armenian genocide. As a representative of Doughty Street Chambers, she has continued to promote Armenia and has denounced Turkey\u2019s attitude on Armenia as \u201chypocritical.\u201d A large number of Turkish-Armenians had previously sought to have the 1915 atrocities classed as genocide, but their efforts were unsuccessful.\n\nIn addition, in 2015, Amal filed a lawsuit against the government of the Philippines, alleging that former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has been detained indefinitely. The United Nations later came to the opinion that the former\u2019s imprisonment constituted a violation of international human rights obligations. Later same year, Alamuddin became a member of the legal team defending Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, against charges of corruption. Nasheed had been sentenced to 13 years in prison in part because of what has been referred to be a kangaroo court process. Later on, she was credited with helping to strengthen democracy in the Maldives.\n\nAmal had a very busy year in 2015, as she was also involved in the so-called \u201cHooded Men\u201d investigation. The illegal interrogation methods used by the British government against Irish citizens were the subject of this investigation. In 2016, Amal testified for the first time at the United Nations, drawing attention to the rape and slave market orchestrated by ISIL and calling for action. According to Amal, this includes the establishment of an online slave market on Facebook, which continues to exist today.\n\nWith the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Amal was appointed as a special envoy in 2019. In this capacity, she campaigned to protect worldwide media freedom. Despite her enthusiasm for the position, she resigned in protest in 2020 after it was discovered that the UK government had violated international law in connection with the Brexit referendum.\n\nRelationship\n\nAmal first became engaged to George Clooney in 2014, after meeting him a year earlier through a mutual friend. They have been together since. Later in 2014, they were married in a ceremony that took place in Venice. They were married in a ceremony that created quite a stir in the media. When Amal and George announced in 2017 that they were expecting their first child, the media erupted into a frenzy once more. Later in the year, the couple became parents to twins who were born in December.\n\nActivism\n\nThe Clooney Foundation, which George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin co-founded in 2016, is a collaborative effort between the two. The group aspires to make progress in the advancement of justice throughout the world. A scholarship named after Amal Clooney was established by the couple, which provides financial assistance to a female Lebanese student enrolling in a 2-year International Baccalaureate curriculum.\n\nProperty\n\nAmal and her husband, George Clooney, own a substantial amount of real estate in the United States. They have real estate holdings in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America. A property on Lake Como and a mansion in England, both valued at $13 million, are among their most prominent residences. Clooney also has a mansion in Laglio, Italy, worth $13 million, and the couple used to possess a holiday home in San Lucas, Mexico, which they sold a few years ago.\n\nNew York City\u2019s One Hundred Fifty-third Street skyscraper was the site of the couple\u2019s first apartment purchase, which occurred in 2016. Despite the fact that the exact cost of this property is unknown, the penthouse suite in this complex is valued at $65 million. Some of their less well-known properties can be found in areas like Las Vegas and Studio City, for example. Many of these houses were purchased long before Clooney and Amal became engaged to be married.\n\nRead More: Marshawn Lynch Net Worth: How He Earns His Income (Update 2022)?\n\nRead More: Joe Francis Net Worth: Who Is Joe Francis Dating?",

            "text": "S\u00c3O PAULO, SP (FOLHAPRESS) \u2013 Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the African nation, 7,000 kilometers from his home country, was \u201cone of the world\u2019s most recognized countries for accepting and integrating the largest number of migrants\u201d.\n\nIn fact, the small country of 13 million people, according to the United Nations agency overseeing the issue, provides them with regularization and work permits to pursue a \u201cpolicy open to refugees\u201d and economic integration. Today there are about 130,000 people in this situation, most of them from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi, many of whom have lived in the country for decades.\n\nHowever, in practice, access to these rights is not easy. In the refugee camps where 90% of this population lives, there are infrastructural problems, especially for the elderly, whose families have grown over the years without any change to accommodate them.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has endorsed Boris Johnson\u2019s plan. \u201cAlthough Rwanda has generously provided safe havens for refugees fleeing conflict and persecution for decades, most are living in camps with limited access to economic opportunities,\u201d Assistant High Commissioner for Defense Gillian Trix said in a statement from April 14.\n\nAccording to Trix, rich countries need to support the immigrants Rwanda is already harboring, not turning others into \u201ctheir goods\u201d.\n\nRefugees in the country have also been affected by alleged human rights abuses by President Paul Kagame\u2019s government. In 2018, at least 12 Congolese were killed by police outside the UNHCR office. They were living in the Kisiba camp, which had a population of 17,000 at the time, and protested against reducing the food quotas they received.\n\nRead on\n\nAccording to the international human rights watchdog (HRW), police opened fire on protesters, injuring several others and arresting 60 for crimes such as rebellion and \u201cspreading false information to create anti-government international opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cRwanda has a well-known record of illegal executions, suspicious deaths in custody, illegal or arbitrary detention, torture and misdemeanors, especially against critics and protesters,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe British government itself has acknowledged that Kagame, the former rebel leader who overthrew the regime that led to the country\u2019s 1994 genocide and has been in power for 27 years, is disrespecting human rights and insisting on adhering to \u201cdemocratic values\u201d. Law \u201c, in a speech in Geneva in January 2021. The UK is granting asylum to Rwandans who have fled Kigali due to political problems.\n\nThe persecution of deported dissidents is another point raised by critics of the UK proposal. According to the HRW report on the human rights situation in Rwanda in 2021, \u201cthe government and its allies are putting pressure on Rwandan immigrants in Australia and Canada.\u201d\n\n\u201cRwanda has routinely shown little interest in the protection of refugees under international law,\u201d Luis Madz, director of HRW in Central Africa, told AFP.\n\nThe group claims that refugees who criticize Kagama have been threatened and tortured, and that some of them have been abducted and forcibly returned to Rwanda, where they have disappeared or died.\n\nThe best example of Paul Russapakina\u2019s story about protecting Tutsi citizens during the genocide in the movie \u201cHotel Rwanda\u201d. Kagamin\u2019s critic says he was abducted in Dubai and flown to Kigali on a private plane, where he was arrested on terrorism charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n\nCarine Kanimba, the daughter of Rusesabagina, who was deported to Belgium, appeared on a list released by Amnesty International in July last year of alleged spying on Pegasus by Rwandan authorities. The list includes more than 3,500 activists, journalists and politicians who, according to the organization, have hacked their cell phones in and out of Rwanda.\n\nOpposition politicians have expressed concern over the high number of refugees in the densely populated country, which is already facing economic problems caused by land shortages and epidemics.\n\nThe Rwandan government denies allegations of human rights abuses and defends the treaty with the United Kingdom. Announcing the partnership, President Vincent Bruda said the country\u2019s recent history \u201chas a deep connection with the plight of those seeking security and opportunity in the new land\u201d and that those who come there will be \u201cprotected, respected and empowered.\u201d You have to.\n\nSpeaking at an event this Friday (22), Paul Kagame declared that his government was not \u201ctrading people\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, please. We really help,\u201d he said, describing the deal as a turning point.\n\nThe president argued that Rwanda had already received refugees detained in Libya under an agreement with the African Union and UNHCR. \u201cWhen the question came up, I said, \u2018Well, we\u2019re not a rich country, we\u2019re not a big country, but there are solutions. We can always help, find and solve big problems.\u2019\n\nBoris says there are some details on how the deal will work in practice, which is intended to make life more difficult for criminal organizations that traffic people. The move by Conservative Party voters opposed to immigration policies elected him to carry out the Brexit process in 2016. Corruption of parties held in his office during locked periods.\n\nThe United Kingdom owes the Rwandan government an initial 120 120 million (R $ 738 million), but analysts point out that Kagame\u2019s motivation to accept the deal is high in the diplomatic arena \u2013 a way to make a profit. Who knows who will get a strong ally to confront and criticize human rights abuses, including those of their own deportees.",

            "text": "The NHS is paying \u00a32bn a year to private hospitals to care for mental health patients because it does not have enough of its own beds, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nThe independent sector receives about 13.5% of the \u00a314.8bn the NHS in England spends on mental health, a dramatic rise since 2005 when it was paid \u00a3951m. Nine out of every 10 of the 10,123 mental health beds run by private operators are occupied by NHS patients.\n\nThe NHS\u2019s increasing reliance on independent care providers comes despite some health service bosses\u2019 concerns that there are persistent \u2013 and sometimes fatal \u2013 problems with the quality and safety of care at many of the mental health units they run.\n\nThose fears, which are shared by NHS psychiatrists, mental health nurses and charities, are borne out by reports of inspections undertaken by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Figures it has provided to the Guardian show that 71 different psychiatric facilities run by non-NHS providers looking after adults or under-18s were found to be \u201cinadequate\u201d since the start of 2017 \u2013 more than one in four of the total of 269 such units.\n\nAccording to the latest research by leading the health market analysts LaingBuisson, independent mental health providers receive \u00a31.964bn a year for treating NHS patients. They have gained a dominant role as the NHS has reduced its own stock of mental health beds despite rising demand for residential psychiatric care.\n\nThe disclosure that the NHS in England is handing independent operators such a massive sum of money prompted Dave Munday, the lead professional officer for the Mental Health Nurses Association, to denounce \u201cthe scandalous privatisation of services that people who are most vulnerable rely on to survive\u201d.\n\nPaul Farmer, the chief executive of Mind, said the \u201cdangerous gradual reduction\u201d in NHS beds over recent years had left it worryingly dependent on the private sector.\n\n\u201cWhile this use of private care providers is itself not concerning, the fact that some patients are being transferred to private providers halfway across the country, or indeed providers who have been deemed by the CQC to be delivering inadequate standards of care, is incredibly worrying, particularly as some of these referrals seem to have led to tragic and fatal consequences,\u201d said Farmer, who chaired NHS England\u2019s mental health taskforce in 2015.\n\nLaingBuisson\u2019s research also shows that:\n\nIndependent mental health care providers now make 91% of their income from the NHS.\n\nTheir typical profit margins are 15%-20%.\n\nA majority of inpatient care for under-18s is now outsourced, with independent operators looking after 55% of all the children and young people who are hospitalised.\n\nNon-NHS providers earn \u00a3316m a year for treating children and young people.\n\nOverall, the four biggest operators \u2013 the for-profit firms Cygnet Health Care, the Priory Group and Elysium Healthcare and the charity St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare \u2013 receive \u00a31.356bn \u2013 two-thirds of the nearly \u00a32bn total. That reflects that between them they run 182 hospitals containing 6,700 (66%) of the independent sector\u2019s total of 10,123 mental health beds. In another sign of their dominant role, the quartet have almost 40% of all England\u2019s secure mental health beds, reserved for the most unwell patients.\n\nWhile private sector beds increased from 9,291 in 2010 to 10,123 in 2021, the number of mental health beds in the NHS dropped from 23,447 to 17,610 \u2013 a fall of 5,837.\n\nThe NHS watchdog gave 10 of the 71 \u201cinadequate\u201d hospitals its lowest rating twice when, on return visits, CQC inspectors found that urgent improvements they had ordered to improve the care of people with conditions such as psychosis and bipolar disorder had not been made, with patients still exposed to danger.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Andrew Molodynski, the British Medical Association\u2019s mental health policy lead, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s persistent underfunding of NHS services and failure to address mental health bed shortages has led to a worrying over-reliance on private providers, many of which have been responsible for a catalogue of patient safety failings, placing very vulnerable patients at increased risk of inadequate care or, in worst cases, self-harm and suicide.\u201d\n\nThe big four non-NHS operators said staffing problems were hampering their efforts to always provide the best possible care for patients with challenging and often complex illnesses, and that only small numbers of their facilities had been rated inadequate.\n\nA Priory spokesperson said: \u201cPriory works in partnership with the NHS and the availability off independent mental health services enables the NHS to give very unwell patients immediate access to treatment which they often lack suitable facilities, or capacity, to offer themselves, and to free up much-needed NHS A&E beds occupied by patients in need of specialist mental health treatment.\u201d\n\nA Cygnet spokesperson said the safety and wellbeing of service users was its \u201cabsolute priority\u201d, adding that 82% of its facilities were rated \u201cgood\u201d or \u201coutstanding\u201d by regulators.\n\nElysium said it was proud to provide care to people at \u201cthe most vulnerable point in their lives\u201d.

            "text": "As a psychiatrist, I reserve admission to a mental health hospital bed for only the most unwell patients, whose mental health has collapsed. But despite my very best efforts to keep as many patients as I can out of hospital, bed pressures pervade every aspect of my daily work. The decision about whether or not we can admit a patient with a psychotic relapse who is not eating or drinking, for example, must first be agreed by the trust\u2019s bed-management team. The woeful and worsening scarcity of NHS mental health beds forces psychiatrists to make very difficult judgments about a patient\u2019s need for care and the risk they pose.\n\nActing in the best interests of the patient often seems secondary to the need to manage our hospital\u2019s limited bed capacity. If, after much robust discussion with bed management, I get the green light to admit someone, I immediately become anxious that my patient will be sent to a private sector \u201coverspill\u201d bed, where I can be fairly sure that they will receive much poorer care than they would receive in the NHS.\n\nI am not for one moment suggesting that being an inpatient in one of England\u2019s underfunded NHS mental health hospitals is a pleasant experience. Most of our wards are dilapidated. Between six and eight patients share a single bathroom. Decades of underinvestment in mental health trusts is there for all to see. If the government is serious about mental health, it needs to start rebuilding our wards to provide a proper therapeutic environment and greater dignity in the care of our patients. And yet, the quality of care that we provide in the NHS for our most unwell patients is much better than they would receive in the private sector.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the NHS has come to rely more and more heavily on the private sector, as our own stock of mental health beds has fallen. This is despite the ever-increasing need and demand for inpatient mental health care. It is a hugely shortsighted policy which has left NHS mental health services at the mercy of companies whose purpose is to make a profit.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am\n\nMany NHS psychiatrists are very concerned about this increasing dependence on the private sector, mainly because the quality of care there is highly variable and also because some private mental health operators use some very questionable practices.\n\nThe idea that private provision of mental health care is \u201cbetter\u201d than NHS care is a myth. Countless Care Quality Commission inspection reports have shown that private mental health hospitals suffer from serious staffing problems. The private mental health sector relies heavily on temporary staff, has few full-time psychiatrists of its own and relies heavily on NHS psychiatrists working there one or two days a week.\n\nThe quality of inpatient therapeutic care is often poor, and the follow-up care after discharge can be nonexistent and badly coordinated with NHS community teams. Once private firms have banked the NHS fees from someone\u2019s stay as an inpatient, they often seem to then forget about the patient, whereas we in the NHS continue to support them for as long as they need.\n\nPrivate beds are sometimes a long way from the patient\u2019s home, family and friends, which is distressing for everyone. I have lost count of the number of families who have complained that their loved ones are in a private hospital far away and that they are therefore unable to visit them. Out-of-area care reduces the support for the patient when they are in hospital, can lead to them staying longer, compromises effective and timely discharge planning and, crucially, reduces their chances of recovery.\n\nPrivate mental health hospitals often seem to hold on to NHS patients for longer than necessary. They have no incentive to discharge patients and are paid to keep their beds filled, with a guaranteed income from the taxpayer. Longer than needed inpatient stays are bad for patients. When an inpatient stay lasts for many months, the person can become institutionalised and deskilled in everyday tasks.\n\nSome private hospitals also tell patients what they want to hear. They can agree too readily with the patient\u2019s self-diagnosis. A diagnosis of personality disorder in the NHS often becomes bipolar disorder in the private sector. Again, this seems to be all about filling their beds and boosting their profits.\n\nPrivate care of NHS mental health patients is bad for patients, bad for the NHS and bad for taxpayers. The government needs to face up to this by building more NHS inpatient mental health bed capacity.\n\nThe author is a psychiatrist working at a London mental health trust",

It\u2019s celebrated in many countries, not just England \u2013 he is the patron saint of Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Portugal and parts of Catalonia in Spain.

In England, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking it\u2019s just any other day \u2013 but why is this the case? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nHistory of St. George\n\nSign up to our daily newsletter Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting...\n\nContrary to popular belief, St. George was actually born in Cappadocia (modern day Turkey), not England.\n\nSaint George was born in Cappadocia and served as a member of Emperor Diocletian\u2019s Praetorian Guard (the Emperor\u2019s bodyguards and intelligence agents). He was discovered to be a Christian and was consequently considered a heretic by Diocletian, who had him sentenced to death by beheading. Some Roman accounts claim that George was brutally tortured before his execution, over the course of seven excruciating years.\n\nThis act of martyrdom for his religion is what made him a saint \u2013 though other sources believe George to be a different person entirely. Edward Gibbon, an historian from the 16th century, claimed that George was actually a corrupt bishop who enforced high taxes on the Greeks for his own monetary gain. In Gibbon\u2019s account, George was eventually captured and killed by the oppressed masses.\n\nGibbon\u2019s take on St. George has been frequently challenged \u2013 most sources indicated that he was killed and martyred before 290, while the George of Cappadocia that he is referring to was active well into the 4th century.\n\nOf course, the real St. George didn\u2019t go out and slay a dragon to save a village. This myth originates back to the 11th century in Georgia, almost a millennium after the real St. George had already died.\n\nEngland flags are often out in full force for sporting events - but rarely for St. George's Day.\n\nWhy do we not get a day off on St. George\u2019s Day?\n\nThe Church of England, headed by the monarch of the UK (currently, Elizabeth II), forbids any national holidays regarding saints in between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday.\n\nThis hasn\u2019t always been the case. During 15th century, all the way up until the end of the 18th century, St. George\u2019s Day was a major celebration across the whole country - on a par with even Christmas. Some believe the waning of its popularity had something to with England\u2019s union with Scotland after the Scottish king, James VI (James I in England), took control of the throne after Elizabeth I\u2019s death.\n\nSeveral politicians have lobbied for a bank holiday on St. George\u2019s Day, including Andrew Rosindell, Jeremy Corbyn and current Prime Minister Boris Johnson. However, there has yet to be an official initiative from parliament to make it a national day off.",

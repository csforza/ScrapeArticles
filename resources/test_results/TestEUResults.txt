This move was a reaction to the terrible atrocities the Russian aggressor committed in the Ukrainian city of Bucha, were civilians, including children, were murdered. The Russian leadership was responsible for the “incredible brutality”, Annalena Baerbock had stated back then. Now, Russia reacted by expelling 40 German diplomats.\n\nAdverse Conditions\n\n“We expected the step that was taken today”, Germany’s Foreign Minister stated on Monday. “But it is not justified at all.” The 40 members of the Russian representations in Germany who had been expelled from the Federal Republic had not worked in the field of diplomacy even one single day. Instead, these persons had “worked against our freedom and the cohesion of our society, for years”. On top of it all, their work had threatened those who were looking for protection in Germany. “We could not tolerate this anymore, and we will not tolerate it in the future”, Mrs. Baerbock said.\n\nOur staff, my colleagues from the Foreign Ministry who are being expelled from Russia, have not done anything wrong. In spite of adverse conditions, they had gone to Russia with an open mind and interest, and they had put a lot of efforts into serving the bilateral relations. “With those expulsions that were announced today, Russia is harming itself”, Annalena Baerbock stated in Berlin.\n\nExtensive Support\n\nThe Green Foreign Minister said she had discussed Russia’s expected move and the difficult consequences for the staff with the German representations in Russia, in the past days. She announced the people affected and their families who were confronted with challenges now would be supported extensively.\n\nThe Berlin Spectator now has a newsletter. You can subscribe to it here:\n\nAccording to several German-language publications, about one third of the diplomatic corps in Russia is affected by the expulsions. More than 100 Germans will have to leave Russia. This number includes the diplomats’ family members. Those reports say the German consulates in Russia, including those in Moscow, would have to restrict the services they were offering as a result.\n\nLargest Representation\n\nCompared to all other members of the European Union, Germany has the largest representation in Russia. At least it did until today. Since Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine commenced, several E.U. states have expelled Russian diplomats.\n\nDear readers: We need your help.The Berlin Spectator delivers news and features about a wide range of topics from Germany.

How can it be otherwise?" Lavrov said. "NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war," he added.\n\nIn another interview late Monday, Lavrov vowed peace talks with Ukraine would continue even as he warned of a "real" danger of the conflict in Ukraine escalating into a third world war.\n\n"The danger is serious, it is real, you can\'t underestimate it," Lavrov told the Interfax news agency.\n\nThe foreign minister also told Russian state television that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything.

Lavrov accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of "pretending" to negotiate.\n\nHe told Russian news agencies the content of peace talks would depend on the military situation and added, "Good will has its limits.

The three Baltic states are all members of both the EU and NATO.\n\n"The Bundeswehr has already taken on a leading role among NATO\'s presence in Lithuania," she added. "We are ready to play a bigger role in the security of our partners."\n\nShe promised to contribute more to the security of the Baltic states if necessary.\n\nBaerbock is meeting with the leaders of the three countries in their respective capitals during her trip. The focus of the talks will be the "reaction from the EU, NATO and the international community to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine," a statement from the German Foreign Ministry said.\n\nGrowing concerns over lack of Ukraine support\n\nOn Thursday, Baerbock addressed the growing chorus of criticism of Germany\'s apparent reluctance to deliver the weaponry Ukraine says it is in desperate need of to fend off the Russian onslaught.\n\n"There are no taboos for us with regard to armored vehicles and other weaponry that Ukraine needs," she said after meeting her Estonian counterpart Eva-Maria Liimets in Tallinn.\n\nGermany\'s priority was to ensure Ukraine quickly got older Soviet-designed kit that its military could use without additional training, she said, adding that it would backfill the stocks of allied countries that had such weaponry to spare, replacing it with more modern German-made equipment.\n\nWatch video 00:34 German FM Annalena Baerbock: \'No taboos\' on arming Ukraine\n\nGermany open to sending armored vehicles to Ukraine\n\nOn Wednesday, the German foreign minister held a joint press conference with her Latvian counterpart Edgars Rinkevics following her first set of talks.\n\nShe said Germany "delivered anti-tank Stinger [missiles] and other things that we didn\'t talk about in public so that the deliveries could be carried out quickly and securely."\n\nShe added that the German government is not against sending armored vehicles, and has already signed off on the option, but currently does not have the capacity to send equipment. However, Baerbock said Germany was taking a long-term perspective on assisting Ukraine with military defense.\n\n"It is about the next three months, and the next three years. This is where Germany can contribute more," she said.\n\nBaerbock also made it clear that German government sending arms to Ukraine does not make Germany a party to the war.\n\nGermany has previously been criticized for not sending heavy weapons to Ukraine.\n\nWatch video 00:19 Germany\'s Annalena Baerbock in Riga\n\nHow did Baerbock address energy concerns?\n\nBaerbock referred to the similar dependence both Germany and Latvia have on Russian gas, saying that the two partners discussed a "similar timely route" to reduce consumption of Russian gas.\n\n"We have made mistakes in this area, but we cannot turn back the clock now, we cannot undo this," she said. "We all want to phase out gas supplies, sooner rather than later."\n\nBaerbock said Germany and its partners must reduce trade with Russia as much as possible. Germany will end its imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, Baerbock said, adding that gas would follow shortly.\n\nShe went on to promise the three Baltic states, as NATO members, that they can "100% rely on Germany."\n\nThe German foreign minister also stressed the desire to learn from Latvia\'s offering of media for Russian speakers. "We have been working together with NGOs for years and media outlets to take the ground from under Russian propaganda channels," she said.\n\nShe called for "strong, independent media and a critical audience" to counter propaganda from the Kremlin.\n\nWhat else is on Baerbock\'s Baltic agenda?\n\nOn Friday, Baerbock will head to Vilnius in Lithuania where she will meet President Gitanas Nauseda and Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landisbergis. German troops have been deployed to Lithuania as part of NATO exercises.\n\nAs former Soviet republics, Baltic countries are home to significant population of ethnic Russians, and have concerns about Moscow using this as a pretext for extending Russian influence.\n\nThe German foreign minister said that the Baltic states have been watching what is going on in Russia "intensely and with concern" for years.

According to the Interfax news agency, the country\'s media supervisor Roskomnadzor has blocked two of its pages with information about the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian prosecutors demanded the move on Saturday. As the site uses https network protocol, barring the access to those pages has reportedly caused the entire site to be inaccessible in Russia.\n\nPreviously, Russian grandmaster Sergei Karjakin had called for the pages with information about what Russia calls its "special military operations" in Ukraine to be blocked.\n\nRussia claims it struck arms depots in the Kharkiv region\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense said Sunday that it had struck nine Ukrainian military targets overnight.\n\nIncluded among those targets were four arms depots in the Kharkiv region where artillery is stored and a facility producing military grade explosives in Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nWatch video 02:39 A village in Ukraine marks Good Friday in wartime\n\nUkrainian negotiator calls for a \'real Easter truce\'\n\nMykhailo Podoliak, the senior Ukrainian negotiator and presidential advisor, urged a "real Easter truce" as both Ukraine and Russia mark Orthodox Easter.\n\nOn Twitter, Podoliak also urged a humanitarian corridor out of the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\n"Russia is continuously attacking the Mariupol Azovstal.

The Kremlin has argued that because of this, Ukraine\'s national identity is virtually identical to Russia\'s; Kyiv strongly objects.\n\nMeanwhile, Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world\'s Eastern Orthodox Christians, called from Istanbul for humanitarian corridors to be opened in Ukraine where he said "an indescribable human tragedy is unfolding."\n\n"We call once again for an immediate end to the fratricidal war, which, like any war, undermines human dignity," Bartholomew added.\n\nSwitzerland impedes German arms deliveries: report\n\nSwitzerland has blocked the re-export from Germany to Ukraine of Swiss-produced ammunition used in German-made Marder infantry fighting vehicles, according to the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.\n\nThe move by Switzerland, which maintains a neutral status, has held up arms deliveries by Germany at a time when Berlin is already under fire for failing to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons to help fight off Russia\'s invasion of the country.\n\nSwitzerland has gone against previous practice and adopted EU sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for its invasion, but has insisted its neutrality does not allow it to send arms to conflict zones. Swiss officials have previously rejected Poland\'s request for the Alpine state to send arms to Ukraine.\n\nThe Marder vehicles are made by German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall but use Swiss-manufactured ammunition.\n\nUK says Russian troops suffer from poor morale\n\nRussia has made "some territorial gains" since starting the ongoing offensive in the east of the country, according to UK military intelligence. At the same time, UK officials said that Ukraine provided strong resistance and inflicted significant losses on the Russian forces.\n\n"Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness," they said on Twitter.\n\nUkraine governor says Russian attacks killed 8 in Luhansk\n\nRussian shelling killed eight people and injured two more in Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, according to governor Serhiy Gaidai. The Ukrainian official two more people were seriously injured, and no less than eight buildings were destroyed in the region, which is partially controlled by pro-Russian rebels.\n\nThe numbers could not be independently verified.\n\nWatch video 02:39 North of Kyiv, battle of Teterivske demonstrates \'imprecise\' Russian military style\n\nGermany reportedly to buy Chinook heavy transport helicopters\n\nGermany would buy 60 CH-47F Chinook heavy transport helicopters from Boeing worth around €5 billion ($5.4 billion), Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported, citing government sources.\n\nDeliveries would begin after 2025-2026, and the helicopters are said to replace the aging CH-53G Stallion rotorcraft.\n\nThe paper said the project will be funded from the €100 billion fund Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced in February to modernize the military.\n\nThe paper said Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht would inform the parliament of the decision next week, but a spokesperson for the ministry said no decision on helicopter purchases had been made yet.\n\nOpposition leader calls for German foreign and security policy review\n\nThe leader of Germany\'s opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, has called for a review of German foreign and security policies over the past two decades.\n\n"The entire German foreign and security policies of the past 20 years are in ruins. When this war is over, we must carefully analyze how this happened," he told newspaper Bild am Sonntag.\n\nHe did not spare his own party, saying "serious failures" were made on defense over the past two decades.\n\n"Looking back, we must, unfortunately, say that all defense ministers of the past 20 years made wrong decisions about materiel and the condition of troops," Merz said.\n\nWatch video 04:21 Are Ukrainian forces getting everything they need?\n\nFrom the end of 2005 to the end of 2021, the CDU and its sister party, the CSU, held the Ministry of Defense.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a plan to beef up the German military in February, pledging a special package of €100 billion ($112.7 billion) to boost the strength of the country\'s armed forces.\n\nHe also vowed to increase Germany’s annual defense spending to 2% of the nation’s GDP, in line with NATO demands.\n\nUN Chief to stop in Turkey before visits to Russia and Ukraine\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will visit Turkey on Monday before heading to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and then to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the UN said in a statement.\n\nIn the Turkish capital Ankara, Guterres will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nTurkey has been trying to negotiate an end to the conflict, so far without success.\n\nOn Tuesday, Guterres will meet Putin in Moscow, followed by a trip Thursday to Kyiv in an effort to mediate an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy criticized Guterres\'s decision to head to Moscow before Kyiv, saying there is "no justice and no logic in this order."\n\n"The war is in Ukraine, there are no bodies in the streets of Moscow. It would be logical to go first to Ukraine, to see the people there, the consequences of the occupation," Zelenskyy said.\n\nUkraine blames Russian troops for forcibly recruiting civilians\n\nUkraine has accused Russian troops of forcibly recruiting civilians in occupied regions of eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to young people, doctors were being targeted in the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv regions, Ukrainian military officials wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe UK\'s Ministry of Defense also noted similar conscription practices in the Russian-occupied Donbas and Crimea.\n\n"Any enlistment of Ukrainian civilians into the Russian armed forces, even if presented by Russia as being voluntary or military service in accordance with Russian law, would constitute a violation of Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention," the UK Ministry of Defense wrote on Twitter.\n\nIAEA to provide Ukraine with equipment to keep nuclear plants running\n\nUkraine has asked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the equipment it needs to operate nuclear power plants during the war with Russia.\n\nThe agency says it includes radiation measurement devices, protective material, computer-related assistance, power supply systems, and diesel generators.\n\n"We will coordinate the implementation of the assistance that the IAEA and its member states will provide, including by delivering required equipment directly to Ukraine\'s nuclear sites," IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said.\n\nUkraine has 15 operational reactors at four plants.\n\nGrossi was due to visit the decommissioned Chernobyl plant next week, on the anniversary of the 1986 disaster there.\n\nPutin in church as Ukrainians told to stay home\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attended an Easter mass conducted by the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow.\n\nThe church has strongly backed the Kremlin leader\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPutin did not speak during the service.\n\nPatriarch Kirill said he hoped the conflict in Ukraine would end quickly but did not condemn it.\n\nHis previous statements backing Russia\'s invasion have splintered the worldwide Orthodox Church.\n\nOn Sunday, many Ukrainians will observe Easter, but they were told to attend service virtually as authorities there have announced a nationwide curfew.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nZelenksyy to meet Blinken and Austin in Kyiv\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expecting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to visit Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt would be the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war two months ago.\n\nZelenskyy had high hopes for the encounter, saying Ukraine was expecting more weapons to counter the Russian invasion.

And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence. The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing. Mantoo added that Syria has the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled the country.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nUN doubles Ukraine aid appeal to $2.25 billion\n\nThe United Nations\' humanitarian agency (UN OCHA) said that it has been forced to double its aid appeal to $2.25 billion (€2.11 billion) as the humanitarian situation in the country worsens.\n\n"Over $2.25 billion is now required for needs inside Ukraine, more than double of the amount requested ($1.1 billion) when we launched the appeal on 1 March, a few days after the war began," the UN OCHA said in a statement.\n\nUS, allies will \'move heaven and Earth\' to meet Ukrainian security requirements — Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the aim of the conference at the air base in Ramstein, Germany was to "help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion," as well as to "build up Ukraine\'s defenses for tomorrow\'s challenges."\n\nAustin said that he discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Kyiv\'s "changing requirements" as Russia focuses on Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region. Austin said that the US and its allies will "keep moving heaven and Earth" to meet Ukraine\'s security requirements.\n\n"Ukraine needs our help to win today, and they will still need our help when the war is over," Austin said. He added that the US and its allies have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine\'s defense since the start of the war.\n\nThe defense secretary said that Ukraine "has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia\'s unprovoked invasion."\n\nAustin said that Ukraine\'s allies had provided assistance at "record speed," adding that "Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly."\n\nReferring to Russian troop withdrawal from areas around Ukraine\'s capital, Austin said that the war was "entering a new phase" following what he called "Russia\'s defeat at the battle of Kyiv."\n\n"Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man," Austin said, alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens."\n\nWatch video 01:06 Austin: \'We\'re here to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion\'\n\nExplosions hit radio facility in Russia-backed Trans-Dniester\n\nPolice in the breakaway Moldovan region of Trans-Dniester said that two explosions knocked two powerful antennas out of service in a radio facility close to Ukrainian border. The interior ministry of the region said those antennas were re-broadcasting Russian radio.\n\nThe incident occurred in a small town of Maiac about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the regional capital Tiraspol and roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said.\n\nThe explosions come just a day after several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the state security ministry in Tiraspol.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu is convening a meeting of the country\'s Supreme Security Council on Tuesday over incidents that took place in Trans-Dniester.\n\nTrans-Dniester is a narrow strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River, sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova. The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government has come under increasing pressure over not yet sending heavy weapons to Ukraine.\n\nUS kicks off Ukraine conference at Ramstein air base\n\nA defense conference on securing Ukraine\'s long-term security is now underway at the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has invited around 40 countries to the conference.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes.

Click here for updates from April 24.\n\nMariupol Officials Say New Mass Grave Found\n\nOfficials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new mass grave has been identified north of the city.\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) north of Mariupol.\n\nSatellite photos released over the past several days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nMariupol has been decimated by fierce fighting over the past two months. The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk. The Russian report said oil storage tanks at the facility caught fire around 2 a.m. local time.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires show a burning fire at coordinates that correspond to a Rosneft facility some 70 miles north of the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, adviser to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was cited by the Ukrainian news agency Unian as saying that people who live near the burning oil depot were being evacuated.\n\nMoscow has previously blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s top security officials have denied that Kyiv was behind an earlier airstrike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 35 miles from the border.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin Meet With Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country’s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nIt came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia’s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n“Yes, they’re meeting with the president.

This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:40'}

Credit: Wikipedia - Government.ru Novy Urengoy CC BY 3.0\n\nPoland and Bulgaria will both see their gas supplies turned off by Gazprom in Russia\n\n\n\nAs of today, Wednesday, April 27, Moscow has stopped Russian gas from flowing through the pipes of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline that supplies Poland, and also Germany. In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nAs both sides in the war brace for what could be a grinding battle of attrition in the country’s eastern industrial heartland, top US officials pledged more help to ensure Ukraine prevails.\n\nIn a bold visit to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the American secretaries of state and defence said Washington had approved a 165 million dollar (£129 million) sale of ammunition – non-US ammo, mainly if not entirely to fit Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons – along with more than 300 million dollars (£235 million) in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said after the meeting that the West’s united support for Ukraine and pressure on Moscow are having “real results”.\n\n“When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the American support but said that “as long as Russian soldiers put a foot on Ukrainian soil, nothing is enough”.\n\nMr Kuleba warned that if western powers want Ukraine to win the war and “stop Putin in Ukraine and not to allow him to go further, deeper into Europe”, then countries need to speed up the delivery of the weapons requested by Ukraine.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to “split Russian society and to destroy Russia from within”.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv and perhaps the toppling of its government. But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries. The ministry said the blaze damaged a depot containing diesel fuel. It said the region has enough diesel for 15 days.\n\nIt was not clear if the depot was part of the pipeline infrastructure, but Polish pipelines operator PERN said deliveries to Poland have not been affected.\n\nA Russian news report said another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire on Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nLast month, two Ukrainian helicopter gunships hit an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Mr Zelensky described his meeting with Mr Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging and, importantly, effective”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nWith Russia’s shift in focus towards the Donbas, Mr Zelensky is now focused on more heavy weaponry, such as tanks and artillery.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\n“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory,” Mr Austin said. “We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nIn a boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term on Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to loosen France’s ties to the European Union and Nato.\n\nMs Le Pen had spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.', 'image': 'https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/13713011/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:05'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces).

War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'...

It has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of gas payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract.\n\nPoland also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland.\n\nPoland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, and covers about 50pc of national consumption.\n\nEarlier, data from the EU network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted, but they resumed later today.\n\nPoland\'s energy supplies are secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said today, adding that there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut.\n\nThe country can source gas via two links with Germany including a reverse flow on the Yamal pipeline, a link with Lithuania with an annual capacity of 2.5 bcm that will open on May 1 and via an interconnector with the Czech Republic for up to 1.5 bcm.\n\nAnother 5-6 bcm could be shipped via a link with Slovakia to be opened later this year.\n\nIn addition, PGNiG can import up to 6 bcm per year via the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea, and it produces more than 3 bcm of gas per year locally in Poland. In October, a pipeline allowing up to 10 bcm of gas per year to flow between Poland and Norway, will be opened.\n\nGazprom said that Poland would need to begin making payments under a new scheme as of Tuesday. It did not elaborate and did not comment on PGNiG\'s statement about the possible gas supply stoppage.\n\nOnly a few Russian gas buyers, such as Hungary and Uniper, Germany\'s main importer of Russian gas, have said it would be possible to pay for future supplies under the scheme announced by Moscow without breaching EU sanctions.\n\nThe Kremlin said Gazprom was implementing the presidential decree on enforcing payment for gas supplies in roubles.\n\nPGNiG said it would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas according to the Yamal contract and that any halt of supplies was a breach of that contract.\n\nIt added it has the right to pursue damages over breach of contract.\n\nEarlier today, Poland announced a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, that would be subject to sanctions under a law passed earlier this month allowing their assets to be frozen.

At that time, they thought the war would only last a few days…\n\nThis seems like ancient history now.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to EU leaders at that summit via video link. Shortly after, the author of this Brief met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who said leaders reeled in shock because Zelenskyy’s video call seemed like a final goodbye.\n\n“One shudders because this man who is asking for help and support may not be alive in the next 48 hours”, Petkov said.\n\nSince then, it has become apparent that the Russian army was not as efficient as we thought, and Ukrainian resistance is not only heroic but potent.\n\nArms started to arrive in Ukraine, Kyiv became safe enough to receive visits from foreign officials, and Zelenskyy addressed parliaments across the world.\n\nRussia re-hashed its strategy, abandoning plans for total dominance via a puppet government and concentrating on territories in the east and south of Ukraine that it still hopes to capture and retain.\n\nChances for a ceasefire are linked with a scenario in which one of the two sides is close to capitulation. But as long as both sides harbour other ambitions – Ukraine to regain most of its territory and Russia to obtain full access to the Black Sea – it is unrealistic to imagine a peace agreement.\n\nBesides, the West now looks set to offer Ukraine whatever weapons it needs, while Russia has no other option but to fight because a defeat is simply not an option for President Vladimir Putin. The main risk factor remains that Putin might be tempted to use arms of mass destruction at some point.\n\nBut if this war remains conventional, as we hope, it is safe to assume that it may last a very long time. And if this is the case, we must concede the war will transform Europe and possibly the world.\n\nThe EU was blind to internal developments in Russia during the run-up to the war, which sought to restore “the glory” of the USSR by force.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU remains over-dependent on Russian oil and gas and vulnerable to Russian propaganda and policy of sowing divisions.\n\nIn hindsight, we can say that the most naïve country was Germany, perceived until recently as our Union’s leader. Conversely, perhaps the most alert country was Poland, who has been fighting a rule-of-law war with the European Commission – a dispute that looks rather unhelpful in the current context.\n\nWhen Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in 2019 that she had ambitions to lead a ‘geopolitical Commission’, she could not know that she would have no other choice three years on. EU policies are changing, taboos are disappearing, and bureaucrats are being pushed out of their comfort zone.\n\nIf, for example, the EU cannot reach an agreement on sanctioning the oil imports from Russia, it should abandon the unanimity rule, which serves nobody else but Putin. This would also significantly reduce the power of nuisance leaders like Viktor Orban.\n\nIt should be up to the Commission to make sure that detractors are excluded from specific funding and opportunities. This is part of building the EU’s resilience.\n\nWhile the war drags on, it is safe to bet that the EU will change more than it has done in decades.\n\nIt is good for Europe that the French President Emmanuel Macron has won a second mandate and that in Slovenia, Eurosceptic Janez Janša was badly beaten.\n\nIf the mainstream politicians take the social challenges in their countries seriously, the far-right politicians, who have already lost Putin as an icon, will be squeezed into the corner.\n\nEuropeans are capable of solidarity and will show the best of themselves and perhaps Europe will have a new generation of war leaders, as it did after World War II.\n\nThe Roundup\n\nWith the ongoing French EU Council presidency and the upcoming parliamentary elections, Emmanuel Macron will enjoy no grace period in his second mandate and the opposition, both on the left and the right, is more determined than ever to strip the newly re-elected president of his parliamentary majority.\n\nTwitter Inc is nearing a deal to sell itself to Elon Musk for $54.20 per share in cash, the price that he originally offered to the social media company and called his ‘best and final’, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIf you want to read up on how Slovenia fared in its parliamentary election on Sunday, we’ve got you covered: Conservatives are out, a progressive government is in.\n\nEurope’s market for hydrogen-powered taxis is becoming increasingly competitive, with French company Hype, which has developed them in Paris since 2015, being among the frontrunners.\n\nThe EU and India are set to announce closer cooperation and an imminent relaunch of negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement on Monday, as part of Western efforts to help decrease the world’s second-most populous country’s dependence on Russia.\n\nLook out for…\n\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee holds public hearing on encouraging engagement of young people towards achieving sustainable development.\n\nCouncil of Europe holds conference on ‘Speaking Human Rights Online’.\n\nViews are the author’s.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Shared-Link-The-Hub-Article-Templates-Options-44-800x450.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:10'}

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot. There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\'s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nIn a daily update on the conflict, Britain\'s defence ministry said Russia had only made minor advances in some parts of Donbas.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nIn an emotional address at Kyiv\'s 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral to mark the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday, Zelensky said his nation would overcome "dark times".\n\nWAR GRINDS ON\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country, where the war grinds on relentlessly.\n\nSome 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\nRussia also fired rockets at two towns in the central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\nUkraine\'s general staff described Russian shelling and assaults along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steel works in Mariupol where the last Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a city destroyed during two months of Russian siege and bombardment.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation", denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, Britain\'s The Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.', 'image': 'https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/04/25/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg/BINARY/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:55'}

Once referred to as the European ‘hegemon’ during the euro crisis, Berlin is now showing hesitance and indecisiveness instead of leading Europe through what could be described as the crisis of the century.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany has been pressing the brakes the hardest when it comes to European efforts to put the spoiler of international peace in its place.\n\nIn almost every sanction round – from banning Russia from SWIFT in March to the current issue of energy imports – Germany is one of the last countries to drop its opposition and clear the way for joint EU action against the aggressor.\n\nThe same picture emerges when it comes to weapons deliveries, where Germany is still hesitant to provide Ukraine with the tanks they need to fend off the Russians in Donbas.\n\nGiven the current political fiasco, it is hard to believe that Germany was once feared as reaching an almost hegemonic position in Europe during the euro crisis, where it managed to impose its vision of austerity on the continent.\n\nBut how did we get here, and why is Europe’s economic powerhouse lacking any serious capacity to guide us through this crisis?\n\nThe easy answer is, of course, to point the finger at Chancellor Olaf Scholz and say he is the one stalling the process and showing indecisiveness in Ukraine’s hour of need. Something like this would have never happened if Angela Merkel were still in power, critics utter in Berlin and Brussels.\n\nHowever, this is only part of the story. While Scholz’s leadership skills have been criticised in recent weeks – even by his coalition partners in the FDP and the Greens – the problem is much more profound.\n\nFor Germany, foreign policy was always rooted in its economic interests. It resembled more of an external economic policy instead of focusing on the tough decisions that come with the mess that is international security.\n\nLeadership in Europe meant, first and foremost, protecting its economic interests and spreading its ordoliberal model across Europe.\n\nThis ‘economy first’ approach was, of course, also the reason why Berlin could exert dominance during the euro and Greek debt crisis because all that foreign policy was about was economics.\n\nIn hindsight, it almost feels as if Germany stumbled through the messy place that is international security blindfolded. After all, Merkel was responsible for Germany’s energy dependency on Russia.\n\nAnd economic interests once again prevailed over security concerns when she disregarded the warnings by allies and laid the groundwork for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline – only a few years after Russia revealed its true colours in Ukraine and annexed Crimea.\n\nGermany managed to lead Europe as long as the EU was primarily concerned with questions of economic integration and the problems that come with it.

Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer. It is probably no longer politically tenable for German politicians to find ways of accommodating Putin, and Germany must at long last wrestle with a reality it has long avoided: Building nuclear power plants is perhaps the only viable path to something close to energy independence.\n\nMacron may realize he has other problems as well; although he outpolled the insurgent Le Pen by 17 percentage points, his right-wing opponent delivered her best showing ever by playing on the fears of rising energy prices stemming partly from Western boycotts, among other issues. At a victory rally, Macron declared that “an answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right.” That includes developing a new policy toward a hostile Russia.\n\n“France needs a better Ostpolitik, and Scholz’s Germany doesn’t seem to have a Europe policy,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution. “Neither of them has really come to grips with what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means for the European security order.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/olaf-scholz-macron-G-7-germany-GettyImages-1238300895.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:16'}

It was not disclosed who exactly in the Ukrainian leadership made this decision. In any case, Steinmeier was not able to join the small group of other European presidents who were warmly received in in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nWhy did this happen to the German president? In this question, you could stress both the word "German" and the word "president." I am not certain which of them should be stressed more.\n\nChummy approach\n\nFirst, however, a brief look back at a personal story of mine. In the late summer of 2016, I was in the German city of Weimar, where I was awarded the Goethe Medal along with a prominent Nigerian photographer and a no less prominent Georgian archaeologist.\n\nThe official program included a meeting with three foreign ministers. As a reminder, Germany, Poland and France form the so-called "Weimar Triangle" — the foreign ministers of the three countries meet from time to time, not necessarily in Weimar, but that\'s where it was back then. According to the program, the ministers were scheduled to congratulate the three new laureates.\n\nUkrainian writer Yuri Andrukhovych\n\nOur meeting lasted between one and three minutes at the most. The French foreign minister seemed a little bored, perhaps he was just tired. The Polish foreign minister seemed unhappy with something and grumpy. Only Steinmeier, Germany\'s foreign minister at the time, was affable — it seemed he could hardly keep from patting us on the shoulder or back.\n\nThen he said something like "Oh, well done, congratulations... The Goethe Medal! Great, great... can anyone tell me what it is awarded for — what merits?" That\'s how he spoke to the three of us. It all happened quickly, and no one really listened to our answers. When the TV cameras had their shots, the trio of ministers moved on.\n\nModel Putin sympathizer\n\nAkinbode Akinbiyi, David Lordkipanidze and I later exchanged our impressions of this so-called "meeting." We agreed that it all seemed rather unprofessional and that we regarded Steinmeier\'s question as more of a joke, albeit a bad one. Otherwise, it would have been even more sad. None of us had expected the ministers to bow to us. But this obvious superficiality — and the less obvious but perceptible arrogance — was disappointing to us.\n\nIt was particularly disappointing to me — after all, I came from the country for which Frank-Walter Steinmeier had come up with his infamous formula. I don\'t want to claim that it played a decisive role in his further career or that it is the reason Steinmeier was elected President twice. But I can say with certainty that it is precisely because of this formula that Ukrainian society sees him as a model of a Putin sympathizer, and almost as an "agent of Moscow."\n\nWritten by Moscow?\n\nThe infamous formula which lost all meaning on February 24 was de facto intended to cement Ukraine\'s surrender in the Donbas. It matches Putin\'s plans to such an extent that the Ukrainians understandably attributed its true authorship to Moscow. Allegedly, Steinmeier was adhering to the wishes of his Russian friends and agreed to lend his name and suggested auhorship to a project that was disasterous for Ukraine. If secret diplomacy is considered to evil par excellence, the current German president holds the copyright to its embodiment — at least in the eyes of many Ukrainians.\n\nI do not think Steinmeier is aware of how often Ukrainian media, especially since 2019, have mentioned his name along with the word "formula." It is not an exaggeration to say it was thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of times. Along with this "popularity" comes an avalanche of criticism, distrust and outright rejection. For Ukrainians, the "Steinmeier formula" has become a synonym for something insidious and threatening, a kind of Trojan horse for the destruction of Ukrainian statehood.\n\nUnrivaled unpopularity\n\nPerhaps the "author" himself, who has long since moved to a higher, if rather decorative, position, has already forgotten the essence of the formula he invented. But Ukraine has not forgotten, it has remembered all these years, almost daily, almost always with a curse and always in connection with the name Steinmeier. On the list of German politicians most disliked by Ukrainians, Steinmeier comes second only to his old boss, ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. As for current politically active personalities, no one comes close to Steinmeier\'s unpopularity.\n\nUkrainians are wary when they see photos like this one of Steinmeier and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\n\nWith Steinmeier\'s example in mind, Germany\'s elite should recognize how much damage their ambiguous policies during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict have done since 2014. In the process, they have not only harmed Ukraine, but also themselves: Branded as a partner who is extremely unreliable, cynical, and cunning, whose words egregiously diverge from their actions. As a result, Germany has lost its relevance and — thanks to the efforts of both the previous and current federal government — has become an outsider.\n\n\'Unimportant president of an unimportant country\'\n\nUkrainian society and the country\'s leadership, which is heavily dependent on public opinion, clearly felt the moment when the United States and Britain filled the vacuum — the moment they were able to say "no" even to German President Steinmeier and had to do so for strategic reasons.\n\nBut the "unimportant president of an unimportant country" can radically fix that situation. Germany as a whole can recover its role in the eyes of Ukrainians — in particular as neither the US nor Britain are involved: in providing effective and committed support to Ukraine on the road to EU membership. Germany should do so, however without flirting with the aggressor and the ambiguities that go with it.\n\nYuri Andrukhovych is a Ukrainian writer, poet, essayist and translator.

"We don\'t have airplanes. We have only cars and trains now," he said.\n\nThe still-operational rail links in the country have also come into political focus in recent weeks, with various foreign leaders using the trains to visit Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine.\n\n"All Western leaders who arrived to Ukraine, arrived by train. […] We call it Iron Diplomacy, and we will keep bringing more people to Kyiv. For us, it\'s important to give the opportunity to those leaders who want to show their support of Ukraine by visiting Kyiv, to travel to Kyiv safe, and travel back safe," Kamyshin said.\n\nWatch video 02:41 Courageous rail workers keep Ukraine running amid war\n\nBiden names new US ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden has named Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine, the White House said in a statement.\n\nBridget Brink currently represents the United States in Slovakia.\n\nBrink\'s nomination must be confirmed by the US Senate.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that US diplomats would begin to return to Ukraine starting next week.\n\nWatch video 02:08 US pledges more arms funding for Ukraine\n\nNo southern Ukraine secession referendum plans — Russian Foreign Ministry\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry has denied claims that Moscow is planning a referendum on the secession of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson.\n\n"I have not heard anything about that," deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko told journalists.\n\nRudenko also said that a face-to-face meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers was not planned at present. Moscow has accused Kyiv of dragging out negotiations and claims to have handed over proposals to Ukraine last week, which Kyiv has denied.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday accused Moscow of planning to "falsify" a referendum in parts of Ukraine\'s south that are under Russian control after Russia\'s Central Military District (CFD) command said that Moscow was planning to seize the region.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Demonstrations against Russian referendum plan in Kherson\n\n\'Right now I\'m talking to you from a bunker\' says DW correspondent\n\nDW correspondent Emmanuelle Chaze said that half of the $700 million in military assistance announced by the US will go directly to Kyiv, and half will go to NATO allies that have been supporting Ukraine.\n\nWatch video 03:21 Airstrikes near Lviv: DW\'s Jan-Philipp Scholz reports\n\nSpeaking from the western city of Liviv, Chaze added that $165 million worth of ammunition will be delivered to Ukraine.\n\nChaze said that the situation in Mariupol is "dire," adding that Ukrainian soldiers and hundreds of civilians are still trapped in the Azovstal steel plant in the city.

The ceasefire is set to begin at 2 p.m. Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Monday.\n\nThe ministry said any civilians trapped at the facility could leave in whichever direction they chose.\n\nOn April 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he cancelled plans to storm the Azovstal plant in Mariupol. He said he wanted the plant to be securely blockaded instead.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian fighters at the Azovstal plant reported heavy shelling and Russian attacks in recent days.\n\nAzovstal is the last remaining pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the key port of Mariupol.\n\nGermany\'s Steinmeier meets Ukrainian Holocaust survivors\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Ukrainian Holocaust survivors in Berlin and said that he hoped that refugees in Germany would feel safe from further attacks.\n\nSteinmeier met the survivors during a visit to a care facility in Berlin\'s eastern neighborhood of Marzahn.\n\nThe six Holocaust survivors told Steinmeier stories of their escape from Ukrainian cities, which in some cases lasted several days. The four women and two men were brought to Germany with the help of Jewish organizations.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the president\'s office, around 70 Holocaust survivors from Ukraine who are in need of serious care have so far been admitted in 11 German cities.\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Holocaust survivors in Berlin who fled Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia \'greeted\' Ukraine on Easter with missile strikes, Zelenskyy said\n\nIn a morning video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia "greeted" Ukraine with missiles strikes over the weekend, when Orthodox Easter was celebrated. The majority of population in both Russia and Ukraine are Orthodox Christians.\n\n"Why was this blow needed at Easter? There is no military threat from which this could protect Russia. This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the biggest Orthodox holiday," Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also spoke about yesterday\'s visit by top US officials. "Assistance to Ukraine was the number one issue in talks with representatives of the United States of America, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin," Zelenskyy said.\n\n"We share the same understanding with the United States: when democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world. When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world," said the Ukrainian president.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskyy also mentioned the morning air raids in the Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv and Odesa regions. However, he did not provide any information on the rocket attacks reported at train stations in western Ukraine.\n\nUkraine reports deadly rocket attacks in central Vinnytsia region\n\nTwo towns in Ukraine\'s central Vinnytsia region came under fire on Monday, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, according to local officials.\n\nThe cities of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn were struck by "rocket fire," local governor Serhiy Borzov said on Facebook. The attacks reportedly targeted "critical infrastructure" in the region, he said. Both cities are important railway junctions on the route from Kyiv to western Ukraine.\n\nBorzov also said the strikes caused deaths and injuries, but he did not give any numbers.\n\nRailway stations struck by missiles — Ukrainian railway chief\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine have been hit by missile strikes, according to the head of the country\'s railways, Oleksandr Kamyshin.\n\n"Russian forces are systematically destroying the infrastructure of our railways," Kamyshin said on his Telegram channel.\n\nKamyshin added that trains are being forced to alter routes and schedules for security reasons.\n\nReports of missile attacks also emerged in the western city of Lviv and southwestern city of Vinnytsia.\n\nAccording to Maksym Kozytskyy, the governor of the western Lviv region, an explosion occurred on Monday morning at the traction substation of the Krasne railway station as a result of a missile strike.\n\nOne missile was destroyed by Ukrainian air defense. The missiles flew to western Ukraine from the southeast, Kozytskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe added that the missiles were likely fired from Russian strategic aircraft. He had no information yet about possible victims.\n\nKyiv needs long-range fires and tanks — US Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed and that Kyiv now needs long-range fires for both artillery and missiles, as well as tanks.\n\nAustin said that he and Blinken had discussed "security assistance" and "training" with Ukrainian officials. He said that the meeting was to talk about things that would "enable us to win the current fight and also build for tomorrow."\n\n"We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," Austin said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke to reporters following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nAustin is scheduled to go to the Ramstein US Air Base in western Germanyon Tuesday to speak with allies on how best to support Ukraine.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense said it is difficult for the US to track what happens to weapons transferred to Ukraine as there are no US forces on the ground, but added that he spoke to Kyiv to make sure weapons were tracked as best as possible.\n\nRussia \'failing\' in its war aims — Blinken\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press conference following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Russia has been "failing" when it came to its war aims in Ukraine, while Kyiv is "succeeding."\n\n"Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine," Blinken said. "That has failed."\n\nBlinken said that Russia\'s military was underperforming and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin\'s on the scene," Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees "final success."\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "things are beginning to get back to normal" in Kyiv, but noted that "that\'s in stark contrast to what\'s going on" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas — UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain\'s defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, "Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. Britain\'s defense ministry believes this "reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia\'s losses from the domestic population."\n\nWatch video 01:57 Ukraine war: Russia\'s renewed ambitions in the east\n\nRussia increased military spending to $65.9 billion in 2021\n\nWorld military expenditure surpassed the $2 trillion mark (€1.8 trillion) for the first time in 2021, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe report released on Monday shows Russia increased its military expenditure to $65.9 billion in 2021 to reach 4.1% of its GDP.\n\nIt was the third consecutive year of growth and Russia\'s military spending. Moscow was the fifth largest spender in the world, behind the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nUkraine\'s military spending has risen by 72% since Russia\'s annexation of Crimea in 2014. It spent $5.9 billion, or 3.2% of the country\'s GDP, in 2021.\n\nTotal spending in Europe in 2021 amounted to $418 billion, 3% higher than in 2020 and 19% higher than in 2012. Many European countries have contributed substantial military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, and third-largest spender Germany boosted its military aid budget to €2 billion a little over a week ago.\n\nThe United States saw a drop in expenditure in 2021 due to a drop in American spending on research and development. The US is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, having provided an additional $800 million in mid-April and another $322 million this Sunday.\n\nWatch video 02:24 US approves more military aid to Ukraine\n\nBlinken and Austin announce aid, diplomatic surge\n\nThe United States will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military financing and has approved a $165 million sale of ammunition to the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe announcement came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt was the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war.\n\nThe US officials also pledged further assistance worth $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries, with the $322 million earmarked specifically for Kyiv.\n\nThe new money brings the total amount of US military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said.\n\nThe two returned overland to Poland after their meeting. While Blinken was returning to Washington, Austin would head to Ramstein in Germany, for a meeting Tuesday of NATO defense ministers and other donor countries.\n\nWatch video 03:37 Zelenskyy hopes US Foreign and Defense Ministers bring promises of weapons: DW\'s Rebecca Ritter\n\nFire at Russian oil depot north of Ukrainian border\n\nA large fire was reported at an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk. The emergency services ministry told Russian news agencies it was a single large fire.\n\nIt was not immediately not clear how the fire started. Bryansk is located about 380 kilometers (236 miles) southwest of Moscow.\n\nThe city is the administrative center of the Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials on Thursday had said Ukrainian helicopters hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the Bryansk region.\n\nThere was no immediate indication the fire on Monday at the oil storage facility was related to the war in Ukraine.\n\nEU considering \'smart sanctions\' against Russian oil\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, the UK newspaper The Times reported.\n\nQuoting the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis, the paper reported that the precise details of the oil sanctions had not yet been agreed but could include a gradual phasing-out of Russian oil or imposing tariffs on imports beyond a certain price cap.\n\n"We are working on a sixth sanctions package, and one of the issues we are considering is some form of an oil embargo. When we are imposing sanctions, we need to do so in a way that maximizes pressure on Russia while minimizing collateral damage on ourselves," Dombrovskis said.\n\nEurope spends around $450 million (€417 million) per day on Russian crude oil and refined products.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand show support for Ukraine at ANZAC Day commemorations\n\nThe leaders of Australia and New Zealand used their annual speeches on Anzac Day to show support for Ukraine.\n\nAnzac Day marks the anniversary of Australian and New Zealand soldiers landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in 1915 during World War I but is now used to commemorate troops from all conflicts.\n\n"The invasion of Ukraine is a senseless act of war, one that is taking the lives of innocent people. It is a threat to the international laws that a nation like ours relies on — but it is also a threat to our sense of humanity. And that makes it a threat to all of us," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said\n\nNew Zealand was physically distanced from the conflict but "inextricably linked" to what it represented, Ardern added.\n\nAcross the Tasman sea, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the people of Ukraine, who are fighting a Russian invasion.\n\n"On this particular day, as we honor those who fought for our liberty and freedom, we stand with the people of Ukraine who do the same thing at this very moment," Morrison said.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nSummary of Sunday\'s events in Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv. A senior Ukrainian official confirmed the meeting. Zelenskyy was expected to push Washington for more powerful weapons.\n\nRussia\'s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol. Ukraine\'s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing "offensive operations" at the Azovstal steel plant.\n\nThe UN refugee agency said 5,186,744 Ukrainians have fled since the start of Russia\'s invasion, an increase of 23,058 on Saturday\'s figures.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has said it is "extremely concerned" after several of its Ukrainian members were believed to have been arrested in pro-Russian separatist territories in the country\'s east. In a tweet, the organization said it was using all available channels to facilitate their release.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defense said Russia was planning a "staged referendum in the southern city of Kherson aimed at justifying its occupation." In 2014, Russia held a sham referendum in Crimea to retrospectively justify its annexation of the territory.\n\ndh, si, lo/sri,rs (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61578306_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:01'}

"We all want to phase out gas supplies, sooner rather than later."\n\nBaerbock said Germany and its partners must reduce trade with Russia as much as possible.

The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk.

Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back.

Credit: Wikipedia - Government.ru Novy Urengoy CC BY 3.0\n\nPoland and Bulgaria will both see their gas supplies turned off by Gazprom in Russia\n\n\n\nAs of today, Wednesday, April 27, Moscow has stopped Russian gas from flowing through the pipes of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline that supplies Poland, and also Germany. In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nAs both sides in the war brace for what could be a grinding battle of attrition in the country’s eastern industrial heartland, top US officials pledged more help to ensure Ukraine prevails.\n\nIn a bold visit to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the American secretaries of state and defence said Washington had approved a 165 million dollar (£129 million) sale of ammunition – non-US ammo, mainly if not entirely to fit Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons – along with more than 300 million dollars (£235 million) in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said after the meeting that the West’s united support for Ukraine and pressure on Moscow are having “real results”.\n\n“When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the American support but said that “as long as Russian soldiers put a foot on Ukrainian soil, nothing is enough”.\n\nMr Kuleba warned that if western powers want Ukraine to win the war and “stop Putin in Ukraine and not to allow him to go further, deeper into Europe”, then countries need to speed up the delivery of the weapons requested by Ukraine.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to “split Russian society and to destroy Russia from within”.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv and perhaps the toppling of its government. But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries. The ministry said the blaze damaged a depot containing diesel fuel. It said the region has enough diesel for 15 days.\n\nIt was not clear if the depot was part of the pipeline infrastructure, but Polish pipelines operator PERN said deliveries to Poland have not been affected.\n\nA Russian news report said another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire on Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nLast month, two Ukrainian helicopter gunships hit an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Mr Zelensky described his meeting with Mr Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging and, importantly, effective”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nWith Russia’s shift in focus towards the Donbas, Mr Zelensky is now focused on more heavy weaponry, such as tanks and artillery.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\n“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory,” Mr Austin said. “We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nIn a boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term on Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to loosen France’s ties to the European Union and Nato.\n\nMs Le Pen had spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.', 'image': 'https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/13713011/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:05'}

It has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of gas payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract.\n\nPoland also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland.\n\nPoland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, and covers about 50pc of national consumption.\n\nEarlier, data from the EU network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted, but they resumed later today.\n\nPoland\'s energy supplies are secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said today, adding that there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut.\n\nThe country can source gas via two links with Germany including a reverse flow on the Yamal pipeline, a link with Lithuania with an annual capacity of 2.5 bcm that will open on May 1 and via an interconnector with the Czech Republic for up to 1.5 bcm.\n\nAnother 5-6 bcm could be shipped via a link with Slovakia to be opened later this year.\n\nIn addition, PGNiG can import up to 6 bcm per year via the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea, and it produces more than 3 bcm of gas per year locally in Poland. In October, a pipeline allowing up to 10 bcm of gas per year to flow between Poland and Norway, will be opened.\n\nGazprom said that Poland would need to begin making payments under a new scheme as of Tuesday. It did not elaborate and did not comment on PGNiG\'s statement about the possible gas supply stoppage.\n\nOnly a few Russian gas buyers, such as Hungary and Uniper, Germany\'s main importer of Russian gas, have said it would be possible to pay for future supplies under the scheme announced by Moscow without breaching EU sanctions.\n\nThe Kremlin said Gazprom was implementing the presidential decree on enforcing payment for gas supplies in roubles.\n\nPGNiG said it would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas according to the Yamal contract and that any halt of supplies was a breach of that contract.\n\nIt added it has the right to pursue damages over breach of contract.\n\nEarlier today, Poland announced a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, that would be subject to sanctions under a law passed earlier this month allowing their assets to be frozen.

Something like this would have never happened if Angela Merkel were still in power, critics utter in Berlin and Brussels.\n\nHowever, this is only part of the story. While Scholz’s leadership skills have been criticised in recent weeks – even by his coalition partners in the FDP and the Greens – the problem is much more profound.\n\nFor Germany, foreign policy was always rooted in its economic interests.

After all, Merkel was responsible for Germany’s energy dependency on Russia.\n\nAnd economic interests once again prevailed over security concerns when she disregarded the warnings by allies and laid the groundwork for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline – only a few years after Russia revealed its true colours in Ukraine and annexed Crimea.\n\nGermany managed to lead Europe as long as the EU was primarily concerned with questions of economic integration and the problems that come with it.

It’s all but certain that Macron will use his second term—his party faces parliamentary elections in June—to further pursue his dream of a truly united “ sovereign Europe ” that speaks with one voice, especially in confronting Russia.\n\nFor a brief historic moment, just after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world witnessed what appeared to be a new spirit of unity between France and Germany. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Feb. 27 declaration of Zeitenwende, or “ the turning of an era ”—meaning a dramatically stepped-up defense and independent energy policy—seemed to reinvigorate the fading idea of the West and imbue the European Union with a new sense of higher purpose. It was just the sort of reinvention that French President Emmanuel Macron has been demanding for years.\n\nFor a brief historic moment, just after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world witnessed what appeared to be a new spirit of unity between France and Germany.

It’s all but certain that Macron will use his second term—his party faces parliamentary elections in June—to further pursue his dream of a truly united “sovereign Europe” that speaks with one voice, especially in confronting Russia.\n\nYet Scholz and his ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) may be going in a different direction. Despite urgent calls for Germany to reduce or eliminate its energy dependence on Russia in the aftermath of President Vladimir Putin’s aggression, Scholz in recent days has stated clearly this is not going to happen anytime soon. He told Der Spiegel in an interview published on April 22 that an embargo on Russian gas wouldn’t affect Putin’s plans and only cause a “dramatic economic crisis” in Germany. Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer. It is probably no longer politically tenable for German politicians to find ways of accommodating Putin, and Germany must at long last wrestle with a reality it has long avoided: Building nuclear power plants is perhaps the only viable path to something close to energy independence.\n\nMacron may realize he has other problems as well; although he outpolled the insurgent Le Pen by 17 percentage points, his right-wing opponent delivered her best showing ever by playing on the fears of rising energy prices stemming partly from Western boycotts, among other issues. At a victory rally, Macron declared that “an answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right.” That includes developing a new policy toward a hostile Russia.\n\n“France needs a better Ostpolitik, and Scholz’s Germany doesn’t seem to have a Europe policy,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution. “Neither of them has really come to grips with what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means for the European security order.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/olaf-scholz-macron-G-7-germany-GettyImages-1238300895.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:16'}

It was not disclosed who exactly in the Ukrainian leadership made this decision. In any case, Steinmeier was not able to join the small group of other European presidents who were warmly received in in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nWhy did this happen to the German president? In this question, you could stress both the word "German" and the word "president." I am not certain which of them should be stressed more.\n\nChummy approach\n\nFirst, however, a brief look back at a personal story of mine. In the late summer of 2016, I was in the German city of Weimar, where I was awarded the Goethe Medal along with a prominent Nigerian photographer and a no less prominent Georgian archaeologist.\n\nThe official program included a meeting with three foreign ministers. As a reminder, Germany, Poland and France form the so-called "Weimar Triangle" — the foreign ministers of the three countries meet from time to time, not necessarily in Weimar, but that\'s where it was back then. According to the program, the ministers were scheduled to congratulate the three new laureates.\n\nUkrainian writer Yuri Andrukhovych\n\nOur meeting lasted between one and three minutes at the most. The French foreign minister seemed a little bored, perhaps he was just tired. The Polish foreign minister seemed unhappy with something and grumpy. Only Steinmeier, Germany\'s foreign minister at the time, was affable — it seemed he could hardly keep from patting us on the shoulder or back.\n\nThen he said something like "Oh, well done, congratulations... The Goethe Medal! Great, great... can anyone tell me what it is awarded for — what merits?" That\'s how he spoke to the three of us. It all happened quickly, and no one really listened to our answers. When the TV cameras had their shots, the trio of ministers moved on.\n\nModel Putin sympathizer\n\nAkinbode Akinbiyi, David Lordkipanidze and I later exchanged our impressions of this so-called "meeting." We agreed that it all seemed rather unprofessional and that we regarded Steinmeier\'s question as more of a joke, albeit a bad one. Otherwise, it would have been even more sad. None of us had expected the ministers to bow to us. But this obvious superficiality — and the less obvious but perceptible arrogance — was disappointing to us.\n\nIt was particularly disappointing to me — after all, I came from the country for which Frank-Walter Steinmeier had come up with his infamous formula. I don\'t want to claim that it played a decisive role in his further career or that it is the reason Steinmeier was elected President twice. But I can say with certainty that it is precisely because of this formula that Ukrainian society sees him as a model of a Putin sympathizer, and almost as an "agent of Moscow."\n\nWritten by Moscow?\n\nThe infamous formula which lost all meaning on February 24 was de facto intended to cement Ukraine\'s surrender in the Donbas. It matches Putin\'s plans to such an extent that the Ukrainians understandably attributed its true authorship to Moscow. Allegedly, Steinmeier was adhering to the wishes of his Russian friends and agreed to lend his name and suggested auhorship to a project that was disasterous for Ukraine. If secret diplomacy is considered to evil par excellence, the current German president holds the copyright to its embodiment — at least in the eyes of many Ukrainians.\n\nI do not think Steinmeier is aware of how often Ukrainian media, especially since 2019, have mentioned his name along with the word "formula." It is not an exaggeration to say it was thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of times. Along with this "popularity" comes an avalanche of criticism, distrust and outright rejection. For Ukrainians, the "Steinmeier formula" has become a synonym for something insidious and threatening, a kind of Trojan horse for the destruction of Ukrainian statehood.\n\nUnrivaled unpopularity\n\nPerhaps the "author" himself, who has long since moved to a higher, if rather decorative, position, has already forgotten the essence of the formula he invented. But Ukraine has not forgotten, it has remembered all these years, almost daily, almost always with a curse and always in connection with the name Steinmeier. On the list of German politicians most disliked by Ukrainians, Steinmeier comes second only to his old boss, ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. As for current politically active personalities, no one comes close to Steinmeier\'s unpopularity.\n\nUkrainians are wary when they see photos like this one of Steinmeier and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\n\nWith Steinmeier\'s example in mind, Germany\'s elite should recognize how much damage their ambiguous policies during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict have done since 2014. In the process, they have not only harmed Ukraine, but also themselves: Branded as a partner who is extremely unreliable, cynical, and cunning, whose words egregiously diverge from their actions. As a result, Germany has lost its relevance and — thanks to the efforts of both the previous and current federal government — has become an outsider.\n\n\'Unimportant president of an unimportant country\'\n\nUkrainian society and the country\'s leadership, which is heavily dependent on public opinion, clearly felt the moment when the United States and Britain filled the vacuum — the moment they were able to say "no" even to German President Steinmeier and had to do so for strategic reasons.\n\nBut the "unimportant president of an unimportant country" can radically fix that situation. Germany as a whole can recover its role in the eyes of Ukrainians — in particular as neither the US nor Britain are involved: in providing effective and committed support to Ukraine on the road to EU membership. Germany should do so, however without flirting with the aggressor and the ambiguities that go with it.\n\nYuri Andrukhovych is a Ukrainian writer, poet, essayist and translator.

Instead, these persons had “worked against our freedom and the cohesion of our society, for years”.

You can subscribe to it here:\n\nAccording to several German-language publications, about one third of the diplomatic corps in Russia is affected by the expulsions.

Those reports say the German consulates in Russia, including those in Moscow, would have to restrict the services they were offering as a result.\n\nLargest Representation\n\nCompared to all other members of the European Union, Germany has the largest representation in Russia.

It said Moscow\'s forces had "targeted and occupied Ukrainian nuclear sites, recklessly damaging the facilities."\n\nThe EU also called on Russia to return control of the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian authorities and "refrain from any further actions targeting nuclear installations."\n\nWatch video 05:46 Nuclear plant attack \'dangerous on many levels\'\n\nMeanwhile, German politician Jürgen Trittin of the Greens focused instead on nuclear energy, saying: "Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of atomic energy. The shutdown, which Germany will finally complete this year, is still taking too long worldwide." Given the recent controversies over German energy policy surrounding the war in Ukraine, Trittin\'s comments might not meet unified agreement among allies.\n\nCruise missiles over a nuclear power plant\n\nRussian troops seized the Zaporizhzhia atomic plant, Europe\'s largest, on March 3; it remains under Russian control.\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company Energoatom said Russian cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Tuesday during an air strike on Zaporizhzhia.\n\n"Missiles flying at a low altitude directly over the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, where there are 7 nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said in a statement on the Telegram.\n\n"Thirty-six years after the Chernobyl tragedy, Russia exposes the whole world to the danger of a repeat of the nuclear catastrophe!"

And that makes it a threat to all of us," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said\n\nNew Zealand was physically distanced from the conflict but "inextricably linked" to what it represented, Ardern added.\n\nAcross the Tasman sea, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the people of Ukraine, who are fighting a Russian invasion.\n\n"On this particular day, as we honor those who fought for our liberty and freedom, we stand with the people of Ukraine who do the same thing at this very moment," Morrison said.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nSummary of Sunday\'s events in Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv.

"We are ready to play a bigger role in the security of our partners."\n\nShe promised to contribute more to the security of the Baltic states if necessary.\n\nBaerbock is meeting with the leaders of the three countries in their respective capitals during her trip. The focus of the talks will be the "reaction from the EU, NATO and the international community to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine," a statement from the German Foreign Ministry said.\n\nGrowing concerns over lack of Ukraine support\n\nOn Thursday, Baerbock addressed the growing chorus of criticism of Germany\'s apparent reluctance to deliver the weaponry Ukraine says it is in desperate need of to fend off the Russian onslaught.\n\n"There are no taboos for us with regard to armored vehicles and other weaponry that Ukraine needs," she said after meeting her Estonian counterpart Eva-Maria Liimets in Tallinn.\n\nGermany\'s priority was to ensure Ukraine quickly got older Soviet-designed kit that its military could use without additional training, she said, adding that it would backfill the stocks of allied countries that had such weaponry to spare, replacing it with more modern German-made equipment.\n\nWatch video 00:34 German FM Annalena Baerbock: \'No taboos\' on arming Ukraine\n\nGermany open to sending armored vehicles to Ukraine\n\nOn Wednesday, the German foreign minister held a joint press conference with her Latvian counterpart Edgars Rinkevics following her first set of talks.\n\nShe said Germany "delivered anti-tank Stinger [missiles] and other things that we didn\'t talk about in public so that the deliveries could be carried out quickly and securely."\n\nShe added that the German government is not against sending armored vehicles, and has already signed off on the option, but currently does not have the capacity to send equipment. However, Baerbock said Germany was taking a long-term perspective on assisting Ukraine with military defense.\n\n"It is about the next three months, and the next three years. This is where Germany can contribute more," she said.\n\nBaerbock also made it clear that German government sending arms to Ukraine does not make Germany a party to the war.\n\nGermany has previously been criticized for not sending heavy weapons to Ukraine.\n\nWatch video 00:19 Germany\'s Annalena Baerbock in Riga\n\nHow did Baerbock address energy concerns?\n\nBaerbock referred to the similar dependence both Germany and Latvia have on Russian gas, saying that the two partners discussed a "similar timely route" to reduce consumption of Russian gas.\n\n"We have made mistakes in this area, but we cannot turn back the clock now, we cannot undo this," she said. "We all want to phase out gas supplies, sooner rather than later."\n\nBaerbock said Germany and its partners must reduce trade with Russia as much as possible. Germany will end its imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, Baerbock said, adding that gas would follow shortly.\n\nShe went on to promise the three Baltic states, as NATO members, that they can "100% rely on Germany."\n\nThe German foreign minister also stressed the desire to learn from Latvia\'s offering of media for Russian speakers. "We have been working together with NGOs for years and media outlets to take the ground from under Russian propaganda channels," she said.\n\nShe called for "strong, independent media and a critical audience" to counter propaganda from the Kremlin.\n\nWhat else is on Baerbock\'s Baltic agenda?\n\nOn Friday, Baerbock will head to Vilnius in Lithuania where she will meet President Gitanas Nauseda and Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landisbergis.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk. The Russian report said oil storage tanks at the facility caught fire around 2 a.m. local time.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires show a burning fire at coordinates that correspond to a Rosneft facility some 70 miles north of the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, adviser to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was cited by the Ukrainian news agency Unian as saying that people who live near the burning oil depot were being evacuated.\n\nMoscow has previously blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s top security officials have denied that Kyiv was behind an earlier airstrike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 35 miles from the border.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin Meet With Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country’s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nIt came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia’s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n“Yes, they’re meeting with the president. Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:40'}

Credit: Wikipedia - Government.ru Novy Urengoy CC BY 3.0\n\nPoland and Bulgaria will both see their gas supplies turned off by Gazprom in Russia\n\n\n\nAs of today, Wednesday, April 27, Moscow has stopped Russian gas from flowing through the pipes of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline that supplies Poland, and also Germany. In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nAs both sides in the war brace for what could be a grinding battle of attrition in the country’s eastern industrial heartland, top US officials pledged more help to ensure Ukraine prevails.\n\nIn a bold visit to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the American secretaries of state and defence said Washington had approved a 165 million dollar (£129 million) sale of ammunition – non-US ammo, mainly if not entirely to fit Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons – along with more than 300 million dollars (£235 million) in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said after the meeting that the West’s united support for Ukraine and pressure on Moscow are having “real results”.\n\n“When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the American support but said that “as long as Russian soldiers put a foot on Ukrainian soil, nothing is enough”.\n\nMr Kuleba warned that if western powers want Ukraine to win the war and “stop Putin in Ukraine and not to allow him to go further, deeper into Europe”, then countries need to speed up the delivery of the weapons requested by Ukraine.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to “split Russian society and to destroy Russia from within”.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv and perhaps the toppling of its government. But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries. The ministry said the blaze damaged a depot containing diesel fuel. It said the region has enough diesel for 15 days.\n\nIt was not clear if the depot was part of the pipeline infrastructure, but Polish pipelines operator PERN said deliveries to Poland have not been affected.\n\nA Russian news report said another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire on Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nLast month, two Ukrainian helicopter gunships hit an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Mr Zelensky described his meeting with Mr Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging and, importantly, effective”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nWith Russia’s shift in focus towards the Donbas, Mr Zelensky is now focused on more heavy weaponry, such as tanks and artillery.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\n“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory,” Mr Austin said. “We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nIn a boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term on Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to loosen France’s ties to the European Union and Nato.\n\nMs Le Pen had spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.', 'image': 'https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/13713011/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:05'}

Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland.\n\nPoland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, and covers about 50pc of national consumption.\n\nEarlier, data from the EU network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted, but they resumed later today.\n\nPoland\'s energy supplies are secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said today, adding that there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut.\n\nThe country can source gas via two links with Germany including a reverse flow on the Yamal pipeline, a link with Lithuania with an annual capacity of 2.5 bcm that will open on May 1 and via an interconnector with the Czech Republic for up to 1.5 bcm.\n\nAnother 5-6 bcm could be shipped via a link with Slovakia to be opened later this year.\n\nIn addition, PGNiG can import up to 6 bcm per year via the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea, and it produces more than 3 bcm of gas per year locally in Poland. In October, a pipeline allowing up to 10 bcm of gas per year to flow between Poland and Norway, will be opened.\n\nGazprom said that Poland would need to begin making payments under a new scheme as of Tuesday. It did not elaborate and did not comment on PGNiG\'s statement about the possible gas supply stoppage.\n\nOnly a few Russian gas buyers, such as Hungary and Uniper, Germany\'s main importer of Russian gas, have said it would be possible to pay for future supplies under the scheme announced by Moscow without breaching EU sanctions.\n\nThe Kremlin said Gazprom was implementing the presidential decree on enforcing payment for gas supplies in roubles.\n\nPGNiG said it would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas according to the Yamal contract and that any halt of supplies was a breach of that contract.\n\nIt added it has the right to pursue damages over breach of contract.\n\nEarlier today, Poland announced a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, that would be subject to sanctions under a law passed earlier this month allowing their assets to be frozen. The law is separate from sanctions imposed jointly by EU countries.', 'image': 'https://www.independent.ie/world-news/84741/41590890.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/gas.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:56'}

The next day, EU leaders gathered for an extraordinary summit. At that time, they thought the war would only last a few days…\n\nThis seems like ancient history now.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to EU leaders at that summit via video link. Shortly after, the author of this Brief met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who said leaders reeled in shock because Zelenskyy’s video call seemed like a final goodbye.\n\n“One shudders because this man who is asking for help and support may not be alive in the next 48 hours”, Petkov said.\n\nSince then, it has become apparent that the Russian army was not as efficient as we thought, and Ukrainian resistance is not only heroic but potent.\n\nArms started to arrive in Ukraine, Kyiv became safe enough to receive visits from foreign officials, and Zelenskyy addressed parliaments across the world.\n\nRussia re-hashed its strategy, abandoning plans for total dominance via a puppet government and concentrating on territories in the east and south of Ukraine that it still hopes to capture and retain.\n\nChances for a ceasefire are linked with a scenario in which one of the two sides is close to capitulation. But as long as both sides harbour other ambitions – Ukraine to regain most of its territory and Russia to obtain full access to the Black Sea – it is unrealistic to imagine a peace agreement.\n\nBesides, the West now looks set to offer Ukraine whatever weapons it needs, while Russia has no other option but to fight because a defeat is simply not an option for President Vladimir Putin. The main risk factor remains that Putin might be tempted to use arms of mass destruction at some point.\n\nBut if this war remains conventional, as we hope, it is safe to assume that it may last a very long time. And if this is the case, we must concede the war will transform Europe and possibly the world.\n\nThe EU was blind to internal developments in Russia during the run-up to the war, which sought to restore “the glory” of the USSR by force.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU remains over-dependent on Russian oil and gas and vulnerable to Russian propaganda and policy of sowing divisions.\n\nIn hindsight, we can say that the most naïve country was Germany, perceived until recently as our Union’s leader. Conversely, perhaps the most alert country was Poland, who has been fighting a rule-of-law war with the European Commission – a dispute that looks rather unhelpful in the current context.\n\nWhen Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in 2019 that she had ambitions to lead a ‘geopolitical Commission’, she could not know that she would have no other choice three years on. EU policies are changing, taboos are disappearing, and bureaucrats are being pushed out of their comfort zone.\n\nIf, for example, the EU cannot reach an agreement on sanctioning the oil imports from Russia, it should abandon the unanimity rule, which serves nobody else but Putin. This would also significantly reduce the power of nuisance leaders like Viktor Orban.\n\nIt should be up to the Commission to make sure that detractors are excluded from specific funding and opportunities. This is part of building the EU’s resilience.\n\nWhile the war drags on, it is safe to bet that the EU will change more than it has done in decades.\n\nIt is good for Europe that the French President Emmanuel Macron has won a second mandate and that in Slovenia, Eurosceptic Janez Janša was badly beaten.\n\nIf the mainstream politicians take the social challenges in their countries seriously, the far-right politicians, who have already lost Putin as an icon, will be squeezed into the corner.\n\nEuropeans are capable of solidarity and will show the best of themselves and perhaps Europe will have a new generation of war leaders, as it did after World War II.\n\nThe Roundup\n\nWith the ongoing French EU Council presidency and the upcoming parliamentary elections, Emmanuel Macron will enjoy no grace period in his second mandate and the opposition, both on the left and the right, is more determined than ever to strip the newly re-elected president of his parliamentary majority.\n\nTwitter Inc is nearing a deal to sell itself to Elon Musk for $54.20 per share in cash, the price that he originally offered to the social media company and called his ‘best and final’, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIf you want to read up on how Slovenia fared in its parliamentary election on Sunday, we’ve got you covered: Conservatives are out, a progressive government is in.\n\nEurope’s market for hydrogen-powered taxis is becoming increasingly competitive, with French company Hype, which has developed them in Paris since 2015, being among the frontrunners.\n\nThe EU and India are set to announce closer cooperation and an imminent relaunch of negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement on Monday, as part of Western efforts to help decrease the world’s second-most populous country’s dependence on Russia.\n\nLook out for…\n\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee holds public hearing on encouraging engagement of young people towards achieving sustainable development.\n\nCouncil of Europe holds conference on ‘Speaking Human Rights Online’.\n\nViews are the author’s.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Shared-Link-The-Hub-Article-Templates-Options-44-800x450.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:10'}

"We are here to support you in any way possible."\n\nSaid Blinken: "The reason we\'re back is because of you, because of the extraordinary courage, leadership and success that you\'ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression."\n\nUS officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for Zelensky\'s government and other countries in the region. An extra $322 million in military aid for Ukraine would take total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, one official said.\n\n"It will provide support for capabilities Ukraine needs, especially the fight in the Donbas," the official said.

Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nJust weeks ago, Kyiv was a frontline city under curfew and bombardment, with tens of thousands of Russian troops massing on its northern outskirts.

Russia has regrouped its forces and sent more troops in to eastern Ukraine. Last week it launched a massive assault there in an attempt to capture eastern provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nRAILWAY STATIONS HIT\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying. Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot. There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems.

Once referred to as the European ‘hegemon’ during the euro crisis, Berlin is now showing hesitance and indecisiveness instead of leading Europe through what could be described as the crisis of the century.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany has been pressing the brakes the hardest when it comes to European efforts to put the spoiler of international peace in its place.\n\nIn almost every sanction round – from banning Russia from SWIFT in March to the current issue of energy imports – Germany is one of the last countries to drop its opposition and clear the way for joint EU action against the aggressor.\n\nThe same picture emerges when it comes to weapons deliveries, where Germany is still hesitant to provide Ukraine with the tanks they need to fend off the Russians in Donbas.\n\nGiven the current political fiasco, it is hard to believe that Germany was once feared as reaching an almost hegemonic position in Europe during the euro crisis, where it managed to impose its vision of austerity on the continent.\n\nBut how did we get here, and why is Europe’s economic powerhouse lacking any serious capacity to guide us through this crisis?\n\nThe easy answer is, of course, to point the finger at Chancellor Olaf Scholz and say he is the one stalling the process and showing indecisiveness in Ukraine’s hour of need. Something like this would have never happened if Angela Merkel were still in power, critics utter in Berlin and Brussels.\n\nHowever, this is only part of the story. While Scholz’s leadership skills have been criticised in recent weeks – even by his coalition partners in the FDP and the Greens – the problem is much more profound.\n\nFor Germany, foreign policy was always rooted in its economic interests. It resembled more of an external economic policy instead of focusing on the tough decisions that come with the mess that is international security.\n\nLeadership in Europe meant, first and foremost, protecting its economic interests and spreading its ordoliberal model across Europe.\n\nThis ‘economy first’ approach was, of course, also the reason why Berlin could exert dominance during the euro and Greek debt crisis because all that foreign policy was about was economics.\n\nIn hindsight, it almost feels as if Germany stumbled through the messy place that is international security blindfolded. After all, Merkel was responsible for Germany’s energy dependency on Russia.\n\nAnd economic interests once again prevailed over security concerns when she disregarded the warnings by allies and laid the groundwork for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline – only a few years after Russia revealed its true colours in Ukraine and annexed Crimea.\n\nGermany managed to lead Europe as long as the EU was primarily concerned with questions of economic integration and the problems that come with it.

Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer. It is probably no longer politically tenable for German politicians to find ways of accommodating Putin, and Germany must at long last wrestle with a reality it has long avoided: Building nuclear power plants is perhaps the only viable path to something close to energy independence.\n\nMacron may realize he has other problems as well; although he outpolled the insurgent Le Pen by 17 percentage points, his right-wing opponent delivered her best showing ever by playing on the fears of rising energy prices stemming partly from Western boycotts, among other issues. At a victory rally, Macron declared that “an answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right.” That includes developing a new policy toward a hostile Russia.\n\n“France needs a better Ostpolitik, and Scholz’s Germany doesn’t seem to have a Europe policy,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution. “Neither of them has really come to grips with what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means for the European security order.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/olaf-scholz-macron-G-7-germany-GettyImages-1238300895.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:16'}

It was not disclosed who exactly in the Ukrainian leadership made this decision. In any case, Steinmeier was not able to join the small group of other European presidents who were warmly received in in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nWhy did this happen to the German president? In this question, you could stress both the word "German" and the word "president." I am not certain which of them should be stressed more.\n\nChummy approach\n\nFirst, however, a brief look back at a personal story of mine. In the late summer of 2016, I was in the German city of Weimar, where I was awarded the Goethe Medal along with a prominent Nigerian photographer and a no less prominent Georgian archaeologist.\n\nThe official program included a meeting with three foreign ministers. As a reminder, Germany, Poland and France form the so-called "Weimar Triangle" — the foreign ministers of the three countries meet from time to time, not necessarily in Weimar, but that\'s where it was back then. According to the program, the ministers were scheduled to congratulate the three new laureates.\n\nUkrainian writer Yuri Andrukhovych\n\nOur meeting lasted between one and three minutes at the most. The French foreign minister seemed a little bored, perhaps he was just tired. The Polish foreign minister seemed unhappy with something and grumpy. Only Steinmeier, Germany\'s foreign minister at the time, was affable — it seemed he could hardly keep from patting us on the shoulder or back.\n\nThen he said something like "Oh, well done, congratulations... The Goethe Medal! Great, great... can anyone tell me what it is awarded for — what merits?" That\'s how he spoke to the three of us. It all happened quickly, and no one really listened to our answers. When the TV cameras had their shots, the trio of ministers moved on.\n\nModel Putin sympathizer\n\nAkinbode Akinbiyi, David Lordkipanidze and I later exchanged our impressions of this so-called "meeting." We agreed that it all seemed rather unprofessional and that we regarded Steinmeier\'s question as more of a joke, albeit a bad one. Otherwise, it would have been even more sad. None of us had expected the ministers to bow to us. But this obvious superficiality — and the less obvious but perceptible arrogance — was disappointing to us.\n\nIt was particularly disappointing to me — after all, I came from the country for which Frank-Walter Steinmeier had come up with his infamous formula. I don\'t want to claim that it played a decisive role in his further career or that it is the reason Steinmeier was elected President twice. But I can say with certainty that it is precisely because of this formula that Ukrainian society sees him as a model of a Putin sympathizer, and almost as an "agent of Moscow."\n\nWritten by Moscow?\n\nThe infamous formula which lost all meaning on February 24 was de facto intended to cement Ukraine\'s surrender in the Donbas. It matches Putin\'s plans to such an extent that the Ukrainians understandably attributed its true authorship to Moscow. Allegedly, Steinmeier was adhering to the wishes of his Russian friends and agreed to lend his name and suggested auhorship to a project that was disasterous for Ukraine. If secret diplomacy is considered to evil par excellence, the current German president holds the copyright to its embodiment — at least in the eyes of many Ukrainians.\n\nI do not think Steinmeier is aware of how often Ukrainian media, especially since 2019, have mentioned his name along with the word "formula." It is not an exaggeration to say it was thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of times. Along with this "popularity" comes an avalanche of criticism, distrust and outright rejection. For Ukrainians, the "Steinmeier formula" has become a synonym for something insidious and threatening, a kind of Trojan horse for the destruction of Ukrainian statehood.\n\nUnrivaled unpopularity\n\nPerhaps the "author" himself, who has long since moved to a higher, if rather decorative, position, has already forgotten the essence of the formula he invented. But Ukraine has not forgotten, it has remembered all these years, almost daily, almost always with a curse and always in connection with the name Steinmeier. On the list of German politicians most disliked by Ukrainians, Steinmeier comes second only to his old boss, ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. As for current politically active personalities, no one comes close to Steinmeier\'s unpopularity.\n\nUkrainians are wary when they see photos like this one of Steinmeier and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\n\nWith Steinmeier\'s example in mind, Germany\'s elite should recognize how much damage their ambiguous policies during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict have done since 2014. In the process, they have not only harmed Ukraine, but also themselves: Branded as a partner who is extremely unreliable, cynical, and cunning, whose words egregiously diverge from their actions. As a result, Germany has lost its relevance and — thanks to the efforts of both the previous and current federal government — has become an outsider.\n\n\'Unimportant president of an unimportant country\'\n\nUkrainian society and the country\'s leadership, which is heavily dependent on public opinion, clearly felt the moment when the United States and Britain filled the vacuum — the moment they were able to say "no" even to German President Steinmeier and had to do so for strategic reasons.\n\nBut the "unimportant president of an unimportant country" can radically fix that situation. Germany as a whole can recover its role in the eyes of Ukrainians — in particular as neither the US nor Britain are involved: in providing effective and committed support to Ukraine on the road to EU membership. Germany should do so, however without flirting with the aggressor and the ambiguities that go with it.\n\nYuri Andrukhovych is a Ukrainian writer, poet, essayist and translator.

Leuna is the primary supplier of fuels to the Thuringia, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt regions -- including the cities of Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nHabeck said the government plans to top up the two refineries with reserves from western Germany as it pushes ahead with the effort to achieve complete independence from Russian oil as soon as possible. The Leuna refinery had already managed to find alternative suppliers, he said.\n\nWider Effort\n\nAs part of a wider effort to stop buying Russian energy, Germany has signed up to a European Union-coordinated embargo on the nation’s coal, and is expanding LNG capacity to help cut reliance on its gas. A deputy foreign minister said last week that Germany is aiming to end Russian gas purchases “during 2024” and oil imports by the end of the year at the latest.\n\nThe options discussed between U.S. and European officials included a ban, a price cap and a payment mechanism to withhold revenue that Russia’s generated since the start of the war in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported last week.\n\nSpeaking alongside Habeck on Tuesday, Polish Environment Minister Anna Moskwa said that the government in Warsaw is ready to join EU partners in ending energy imports from Russia.\n\n“We appreciate the gesture in the form of a coal embargo, and we expect an embargo on other Russian resources without undue delay -- here and now,” she added.\n\nRelated News ///', 'image': 'https://www.worldoil.com/media/3982/udmurtneft-udmurt-republic-russia-image-rosneft.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:21'}

The ceasefire is set to begin at 2 p.m. Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Monday.\n\nThe ministry said any civilians trapped at the facility could leave in whichever direction they chose.\n\nOn April 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he cancelled plans to storm the Azovstal plant in Mariupol. He said he wanted the plant to be securely blockaded instead.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian fighters at the Azovstal plant reported heavy shelling and Russian attacks in recent days.\n\nAzovstal is the last remaining pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the key port of Mariupol.\n\nGermany\'s Steinmeier meets Ukrainian Holocaust survivors\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Ukrainian Holocaust survivors in Berlin and said that he hoped that refugees in Germany would feel safe from further attacks.\n\nSteinmeier met the survivors during a visit to a care facility in Berlin\'s eastern neighborhood of Marzahn.\n\nThe six Holocaust survivors told Steinmeier stories of their escape from Ukrainian cities, which in some cases lasted several days. The four women and two men were brought to Germany with the help of Jewish organizations.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the president\'s office, around 70 Holocaust survivors from Ukraine who are in need of serious care have so far been admitted in 11 German cities.\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Holocaust survivors in Berlin who fled Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia \'greeted\' Ukraine on Easter with missile strikes, Zelenskyy said\n\nIn a morning video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia "greeted" Ukraine with missiles strikes over the weekend, when Orthodox Easter was celebrated. The majority of population in both Russia and Ukraine are Orthodox Christians.\n\n"Why was this blow needed at Easter? There is no military threat from which this could protect Russia. This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the biggest Orthodox holiday," Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also spoke about yesterday\'s visit by top US officials. "Assistance to Ukraine was the number one issue in talks with representatives of the United States of America, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin," Zelenskyy said.\n\n"We share the same understanding with the United States: when democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world. When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world," said the Ukrainian president.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskyy also mentioned the morning air raids in the Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv and Odesa regions. However, he did not provide any information on the rocket attacks reported at train stations in western Ukraine.\n\nUkraine reports deadly rocket attacks in central Vinnytsia region\n\nTwo towns in Ukraine\'s central Vinnytsia region came under fire on Monday, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, according to local officials.\n\nThe cities of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn were struck by "rocket fire," local governor Serhiy Borzov said on Facebook. The attacks reportedly targeted "critical infrastructure" in the region, he said. Both cities are important railway junctions on the route from Kyiv to western Ukraine.\n\nBorzov also said the strikes caused deaths and injuries, but he did not give any numbers.\n\nRailway stations struck by missiles — Ukrainian railway chief\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine have been hit by missile strikes, according to the head of the country\'s railways, Oleksandr Kamyshin.\n\n"Russian forces are systematically destroying the infrastructure of our railways," Kamyshin said on his Telegram channel.\n\nKamyshin added that trains are being forced to alter routes and schedules for security reasons.\n\nReports of missile attacks also emerged in the western city of Lviv and southwestern city of Vinnytsia.\n\nAccording to Maksym Kozytskyy, the governor of the western Lviv region, an explosion occurred on Monday morning at the traction substation of the Krasne railway station as a result of a missile strike.\n\nOne missile was destroyed by Ukrainian air defense. The missiles flew to western Ukraine from the southeast, Kozytskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe added that the missiles were likely fired from Russian strategic aircraft. He had no information yet about possible victims.\n\nKyiv needs long-range fires and tanks — US Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed and that Kyiv now needs long-range fires for both artillery and missiles, as well as tanks.\n\nAustin said that he and Blinken had discussed "security assistance" and "training" with Ukrainian officials. He said that the meeting was to talk about things that would "enable us to win the current fight and also build for tomorrow."\n\n"We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," Austin said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke to reporters following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nAustin is scheduled to go to the Ramstein US Air Base in western Germanyon Tuesday to speak with allies on how best to support Ukraine.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense said it is difficult for the US to track what happens to weapons transferred to Ukraine as there are no US forces on the ground, but added that he spoke to Kyiv to make sure weapons were tracked as best as possible.\n\nRussia \'failing\' in its war aims — Blinken\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press conference following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Russia has been "failing" when it came to its war aims in Ukraine, while Kyiv is "succeeding."\n\n"Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine," Blinken said. "That has failed."\n\nBlinken said that Russia\'s military was underperforming and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin\'s on the scene," Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees "final success."\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "things are beginning to get back to normal" in Kyiv, but noted that "that\'s in stark contrast to what\'s going on" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas — UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain\'s defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, "Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. Britain\'s defense ministry believes this "reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia\'s losses from the domestic population."\n\nWatch video 01:57 Ukraine war: Russia\'s renewed ambitions in the east\n\nRussia increased military spending to $65.9 billion in 2021\n\nWorld military expenditure surpassed the $2 trillion mark (€1.8 trillion) for the first time in 2021, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe report released on Monday shows Russia increased its military expenditure to $65.9 billion in 2021 to reach 4.1% of its GDP.\n\nIt was the third consecutive year of growth and Russia\'s military spending. Moscow was the fifth largest spender in the world, behind the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nUkraine\'s military spending has risen by 72% since Russia\'s annexation of Crimea in 2014. It spent $5.9 billion, or 3.2% of the country\'s GDP, in 2021.\n\nTotal spending in Europe in 2021 amounted to $418 billion, 3% higher than in 2020 and 19% higher than in 2012. Many European countries have contributed substantial military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, and third-largest spender Germany boosted its military aid budget to €2 billion a little over a week ago.\n\nThe United States saw a drop in expenditure in 2021 due to a drop in American spending on research and development. The US is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, having provided an additional $800 million in mid-April and another $322 million this Sunday.\n\nWatch video 02:24 US approves more military aid to Ukraine\n\nBlinken and Austin announce aid, diplomatic surge\n\nThe United States will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military financing and has approved a $165 million sale of ammunition to the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe announcement came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt was the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war.\n\nThe US officials also pledged further assistance worth $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries, with the $322 million earmarked specifically for Kyiv.\n\nThe new money brings the total amount of US military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said.\n\nThe two returned overland to Poland after their meeting. While Blinken was returning to Washington, Austin would head to Ramstein in Germany, for a meeting Tuesday of NATO defense ministers and other donor countries.\n\nWatch video 03:37 Zelenskyy hopes US Foreign and Defense Ministers bring promises of weapons: DW\'s Rebecca Ritter\n\nFire at Russian oil depot north of Ukrainian border\n\nA large fire was reported at an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk. The emergency services ministry told Russian news agencies it was a single large fire.\n\nIt was not immediately not clear how the fire started. Bryansk is located about 380 kilometers (236 miles) southwest of Moscow.\n\nThe city is the administrative center of the Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials on Thursday had said Ukrainian helicopters hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the Bryansk region.\n\nThere was no immediate indication the fire on Monday at the oil storage facility was related to the war in Ukraine.\n\nEU considering \'smart sanctions\' against Russian oil\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, the UK newspaper The Times reported.\n\nQuoting the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis, the paper reported that the precise details of the oil sanctions had not yet been agreed but could include a gradual phasing-out of Russian oil or imposing tariffs on imports beyond a certain price cap.\n\n"We are working on a sixth sanctions package, and one of the issues we are considering is some form of an oil embargo. When we are imposing sanctions, we need to do so in a way that maximizes pressure on Russia while minimizing collateral damage on ourselves," Dombrovskis said.\n\nEurope spends around $450 million (€417 million) per day on Russian crude oil and refined products.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand show support for Ukraine at ANZAC Day commemorations\n\nThe leaders of Australia and New Zealand used their annual speeches on Anzac Day to show support for Ukraine.\n\nAnzac Day marks the anniversary of Australian and New Zealand soldiers landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in 1915 during World War I but is now used to commemorate troops from all conflicts.\n\n"The invasion of Ukraine is a senseless act of war, one that is taking the lives of innocent people. It is a threat to the international laws that a nation like ours relies on — but it is also a threat to our sense of humanity. And that makes it a threat to all of us," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said\n\nNew Zealand was physically distanced from the conflict but "inextricably linked" to what it represented, Ardern added.\n\nAcross the Tasman sea, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the people of Ukraine, who are fighting a Russian invasion.\n\n"On this particular day, as we honor those who fought for our liberty and freedom, we stand with the people of Ukraine who do the same thing at this very moment," Morrison said.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nSummary of Sunday\'s events in Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv. A senior Ukrainian official confirmed the meeting. Zelenskyy was expected to push Washington for more powerful weapons.\n\nRussia\'s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol. Ukraine\'s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing "offensive operations" at the Azovstal steel plant.\n\nThe UN refugee agency said 5,186,744 Ukrainians have fled since the start of Russia\'s invasion, an increase of 23,058 on Saturday\'s figures.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has said it is "extremely concerned" after several of its Ukrainian members were believed to have been arrested in pro-Russian separatist territories in the country\'s east. In a tweet, the organization said it was using all available channels to facilitate their release.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defense said Russia was planning a "staged referendum in the southern city of Kherson aimed at justifying its occupation." In 2014, Russia held a sham referendum in Crimea to retrospectively justify its annexation of the territory.\n\ndh, si, lo/sri,rs (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61578306_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:01'}

"We all want to phase out gas supplies, sooner rather than later."\n\nBaerbock said Germany and its partners must reduce trade with Russia as much as possible. Germany will end its imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, Baerbock said, adding that gas would follow shortly.\n\nShe went on to promise the three Baltic states, as NATO members, that they can "100% rely on Germany."\n\nThe German foreign minister also stressed the desire to learn from Latvia\'s offering of media for Russian speakers. "We have been working together with NGOs for years and media outlets to take the ground from under Russian propaganda channels," she said.\n\nShe called for "strong, independent media and a critical audience" to counter propaganda from the Kremlin.\n\nWhat else is on Baerbock\'s Baltic agenda?\n\nOn Friday, Baerbock will head to Vilnius in Lithuania where she will meet President Gitanas Nauseda and Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landisbergis.

Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus.

He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk.

Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back.

PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries. The ministry said the blaze damaged a depot containing diesel fuel. It said the region has enough diesel for 15 days.\n\nIt was not clear if the depot was part of the pipeline infrastructure, but Polish pipelines operator PERN said deliveries to Poland have not been affected.\n\nA Russian news report said another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire on Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nLast month, two Ukrainian helicopter gunships hit an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Mr Zelensky described his meeting with Mr Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging and, importantly, effective”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nWith Russia’s shift in focus towards the Donbas, Mr Zelensky is now focused on more heavy weaponry, such as tanks and artillery.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\n“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory,” Mr Austin said. “We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nIn a boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term on Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to loosen France’s ties to the European Union and Nato.\n\nMs Le Pen had spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.', 'image': 'https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/13713011/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:05'}

"We are here to support you in any way possible."\n\nSaid Blinken: "The reason we\'re back is because of you, because of the extraordinary courage, leadership and success that you\'ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression."\n\nUS officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for Zelensky\'s government and other countries in the region. An extra $322 million in military aid for Ukraine would take total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, one official said.\n\n"It will provide support for capabilities Ukraine needs, especially the fight in the Donbas," the official said. It would also help Ukraine\'s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defence systems -- essentially NATO capable systems, the official added on condition of anonymity.\n\nWestern arms for Ukraine have infuriated Moscow.

Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot. There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\'s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nIn a daily update on the conflict, Britain\'s defence ministry said Russia had only made minor advances in some parts of Donbas.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nIn an emotional address at Kyiv\'s 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral to mark the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday, Zelensky said his nation would overcome "dark times".\n\nWAR GRINDS ON\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country, where the war grinds on relentlessly.\n\nSome 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\nRussia also fired rockets at two towns in the central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\nUkraine\'s general staff described Russian shelling and assaults along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steel works in Mariupol where the last Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a city destroyed during two months of Russian siege and bombardment.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation", denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, Britain\'s The Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.', 'image': 'https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/04/25/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg/BINARY/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:55'}

Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer. It is probably no longer politically tenable for German politicians to find ways of accommodating Putin, and Germany must at long last wrestle with a reality it has long avoided: Building nuclear power plants is perhaps the only viable path to something close to energy independence.\n\nMacron may realize he has other problems as well; although he outpolled the insurgent Le Pen by 17 percentage points, his right-wing opponent delivered her best showing ever by playing on the fears of rising energy prices stemming partly from Western boycotts, among other issues. At a victory rally, Macron declared that “an answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right.” That includes developing a new policy toward a hostile Russia.\n\n“France needs a better Ostpolitik, and Scholz’s Germany doesn’t seem to have a Europe policy,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution. “Neither of them has really come to grips with what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means for the European security order.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/olaf-scholz-macron-G-7-germany-GettyImages-1238300895.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:16'}

It was not disclosed who exactly in the Ukrainian leadership made this decision. In any case, Steinmeier was not able to join the small group of other European presidents who were warmly received in in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nWhy did this happen to the German president? In this question, you could stress both the word "German" and the word "president." I am not certain which of them should be stressed more.\n\nChummy approach\n\nFirst, however, a brief look back at a personal story of mine. In the late summer of 2016, I was in the German city of Weimar, where I was awarded the Goethe Medal along with a prominent Nigerian photographer and a no less prominent Georgian archaeologist.\n\nThe official program included a meeting with three foreign ministers. As a reminder, Germany, Poland and France form the so-called "Weimar Triangle" — the foreign ministers of the three countries meet from time to time, not necessarily in Weimar, but that\'s where it was back then. According to the program, the ministers were scheduled to congratulate the three new laureates.\n\nUkrainian writer Yuri Andrukhovych\n\nOur meeting lasted between one and three minutes at the most. The French foreign minister seemed a little bored, perhaps he was just tired. The Polish foreign minister seemed unhappy with something and grumpy. Only Steinmeier, Germany\'s foreign minister at the time, was affable — it seemed he could hardly keep from patting us on the shoulder or back.\n\nThen he said something like "Oh, well done, congratulations... The Goethe Medal! Great, great... can anyone tell me what it is awarded for — what merits?" That\'s how he spoke to the three of us. It all happened quickly, and no one really listened to our answers. When the TV cameras had their shots, the trio of ministers moved on.\n\nModel Putin sympathizer\n\nAkinbode Akinbiyi, David Lordkipanidze and I later exchanged our impressions of this so-called "meeting." We agreed that it all seemed rather unprofessional and that we regarded Steinmeier\'s question as more of a joke, albeit a bad one. Otherwise, it would have been even more sad. None of us had expected the ministers to bow to us. But this obvious superficiality — and the less obvious but perceptible arrogance — was disappointing to us.\n\nIt was particularly disappointing to me — after all, I came from the country for which Frank-Walter Steinmeier had come up with his infamous formula. I don\'t want to claim that it played a decisive role in his further career or that it is the reason Steinmeier was elected President twice. But I can say with certainty that it is precisely because of this formula that Ukrainian society sees him as a model of a Putin sympathizer, and almost as an "agent of Moscow."\n\nWritten by Moscow?\n\nThe infamous formula which lost all meaning on February 24 was de facto intended to cement Ukraine\'s surrender in the Donbas. It matches Putin\'s plans to such an extent that the Ukrainians understandably attributed its true authorship to Moscow. Allegedly, Steinmeier was adhering to the wishes of his Russian friends and agreed to lend his name and suggested auhorship to a project that was disasterous for Ukraine. If secret diplomacy is considered to evil par excellence, the current German president holds the copyright to its embodiment — at least in the eyes of many Ukrainians.\n\nI do not think Steinmeier is aware of how often Ukrainian media, especially since 2019, have mentioned his name along with the word "formula." It is not an exaggeration to say it was thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of times. Along with this "popularity" comes an avalanche of criticism, distrust and outright rejection. For Ukrainians, the "Steinmeier formula" has become a synonym for something insidious and threatening, a kind of Trojan horse for the destruction of Ukrainian statehood.\n\nUnrivaled unpopularity\n\nPerhaps the "author" himself, who has long since moved to a higher, if rather decorative, position, has already forgotten the essence of the formula he invented. But Ukraine has not forgotten, it has remembered all these years, almost daily, almost always with a curse and always in connection with the name Steinmeier. On the list of German politicians most disliked by Ukrainians, Steinmeier comes second only to his old boss, ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. As for current politically active personalities, no one comes close to Steinmeier\'s unpopularity.\n\nUkrainians are wary when they see photos like this one of Steinmeier and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\n\nWith Steinmeier\'s example in mind, Germany\'s elite should recognize how much damage their ambiguous policies during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict have done since 2014. In the process, they have not only harmed Ukraine, but also themselves: Branded as a partner who is extremely unreliable, cynical, and cunning, whose words egregiously diverge from their actions. As a result, Germany has lost its relevance and — thanks to the efforts of both the previous and current federal government — has become an outsider.\n\n\'Unimportant president of an unimportant country\'\n\nUkrainian society and the country\'s leadership, which is heavily dependent on public opinion, clearly felt the moment when the United States and Britain filled the vacuum — the moment they were able to say "no" even to German President Steinmeier and had to do so for strategic reasons.\n\nBut the "unimportant president of an unimportant country" can radically fix that situation. Germany as a whole can recover its role in the eyes of Ukrainians — in particular as neither the US nor Britain are involved: in providing effective and committed support to Ukraine on the road to EU membership. Germany should do so, however without flirting with the aggressor and the ambiguities that go with it.\n\nYuri Andrukhovych is a Ukrainian writer, poet, essayist and translator.

This move was a reaction to the terrible atrocities the Russian aggressor committed in the Ukrainian city of Bucha, were civilians, including children, were murdered. The Russian leadership was responsible for the “incredible brutality”, Annalena Baerbock had stated back then. Now, Russia reacted by expelling 40 German diplomats.\n\nAdverse Conditions\n\n“We expected the step that was taken today”, Germany’s Foreign Minister stated on Monday. “But it is not justified at all.” The 40 members of the Russian representations in Germany who had been expelled from the Federal Republic had not worked in the field of diplomacy even one single day. Instead, these persons had “worked against our freedom and the cohesion of our society, for years”. On top of it all, their work had threatened those who were looking for protection in Germany. “We could not tolerate this anymore, and we will not tolerate it in the future”, Mrs. Baerbock said.\n\nOur staff, my colleagues from the Foreign Ministry who are being expelled from Russia, have not done anything wrong. In spite of adverse conditions, they had gone to Russia with an open mind and interest, and they had put a lot of efforts into serving the bilateral relations. “With those expulsions that were announced today, Russia is harming itself”, Annalena Baerbock stated in Berlin.\n\nExtensive Support\n\nThe Green Foreign Minister said she had discussed Russia’s expected move and the difficult consequences for the staff with the German representations in Russia, in the past days. She announced the people affected and their families who were confronted with challenges now would be supported extensively.\n\nThe Berlin Spectator now has a newsletter. You can subscribe to it here:\n\nAccording to several German-language publications, about one third of the diplomatic corps in Russia is affected by the expulsions. More than 100 Germans will have to leave Russia. This number includes the diplomats’ family members. Those reports say the German consulates in Russia, including those in Moscow, would have to restrict the services they were offering as a result.\n\nLargest Representation\n\nCompared to all other members of the European Union, Germany has the largest representation in Russia. At least it did until today. Since Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine commenced, several E.U. states have expelled Russian diplomats.\n\nDear readers: We need your help.The Berlin Spectator delivers news and features about a wide range of topics from Germany.

Click here for updates from April 24.\n\nMariupol Officials Say New Mass Grave Found\n\nOfficials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new mass grave has been identified north of the city.\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) north of Mariupol.\n\nSatellite photos released over the past several days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nMariupol has been decimated by fierce fighting over the past two months. The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk. The Russian report said oil storage tanks at the facility caught fire around 2 a.m. local time.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires show a burning fire at coordinates that correspond to a Rosneft facility some 70 miles north of the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, adviser to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was cited by the Ukrainian news agency Unian as saying that people who live near the burning oil depot were being evacuated.\n\nMoscow has previously blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s top security officials have denied that Kyiv was behind an earlier airstrike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 35 miles from the border.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin Meet With Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country’s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nIt came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia’s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n“Yes, they’re meeting with the president. Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin.

In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

Ukraine is succeeding,” he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the American support but said that “as long as Russian soldiers put a foot on Ukrainian soil, nothing is enough”.\n\nMr Kuleba warned that if western powers want Ukraine to win the war and “stop Putin in Ukraine and not to allow him to go further, deeper into Europe”, then countries need to speed up the delivery of the weapons requested by Ukraine.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to “split Russian society and to destroy Russia from within”.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv and perhaps the toppling of its government. But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries. The ministry said the blaze damaged a depot containing diesel fuel. It said the region has enough diesel for 15 days.\n\nIt was not clear if the depot was part of the pipeline infrastructure, but Polish pipelines operator PERN said deliveries to Poland have not been affected.\n\nA Russian news report said another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire on Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nLast month, two Ukrainian helicopter gunships hit an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Mr Zelensky described his meeting with Mr Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging and, importantly, effective”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nWith Russia’s shift in focus towards the Donbas, Mr Zelensky is now focused on more heavy weaponry, such as tanks and artillery.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\n“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory,” Mr Austin said. “We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nIn a boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term on Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to loosen France’s ties to the European Union and Nato.\n\nMs Le Pen had spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.', 'image': 'https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/13713011/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:05'}

It has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of gas payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract.\n\nPoland also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland.\n\nPoland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, and covers about 50pc of national consumption.\n\nEarlier, data from the EU network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted, but they resumed later today.\n\nPoland\'s energy supplies are secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said today, adding that there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut.\n\nThe country can source gas via two links with Germany including a reverse flow on the Yamal pipeline, a link with Lithuania with an annual capacity of 2.5 bcm that will open on May 1 and via an interconnector with the Czech Republic for up to 1.5 bcm.\n\nAnother 5-6 bcm could be shipped via a link with Slovakia to be opened later this year.\n\nIn addition, PGNiG can import up to 6 bcm per year via the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea, and it produces more than 3 bcm of gas per year locally in Poland. In October, a pipeline allowing up to 10 bcm of gas per year to flow between Poland and Norway, will be opened.\n\nGazprom said that Poland would need to begin making payments under a new scheme as of Tuesday. It did not elaborate and did not comment on PGNiG\'s statement about the possible gas supply stoppage.\n\nOnly a few Russian gas buyers, such as Hungary and Uniper, Germany\'s main importer of Russian gas, have said it would be possible to pay for future supplies under the scheme announced by Moscow without breaching EU sanctions.\n\nThe Kremlin said Gazprom was implementing the presidential decree on enforcing payment for gas supplies in roubles.\n\nPGNiG said it would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas according to the Yamal contract and that any halt of supplies was a breach of that contract.\n\nIt added it has the right to pursue damages over breach of contract.\n\nEarlier today, Poland announced a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, that would be subject to sanctions under a law passed earlier this month allowing their assets to be frozen.

Something like this would have never happened if Angela Merkel were still in power, critics utter in Berlin and Brussels.\n\nHowever, this is only part of the story. While Scholz’s leadership skills have been criticised in recent weeks – even by his coalition partners in the FDP and the Greens – the problem is much more profound.\n\nFor Germany, foreign policy was always rooted in its economic interests. It resembled more of an external economic policy instead of focusing on the tough decisions that come with the mess that is international security.\n\nLeadership in Europe meant, first and foremost, protecting its economic interests and spreading its ordoliberal model across Europe.\n\nThis ‘economy first’ approach was, of course, also the reason why Berlin could exert dominance during the euro and Greek debt crisis because all that foreign policy was about was economics.\n\nIn hindsight, it almost feels as if Germany stumbled through the messy place that is international security blindfolded. After all, Merkel was responsible for Germany’s energy dependency on Russia.\n\nAnd economic interests once again prevailed over security concerns when she disregarded the warnings by allies and laid the groundwork for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline – only a few years after Russia revealed its true colours in Ukraine and annexed Crimea.\n\nGermany managed to lead Europe as long as the EU was primarily concerned with questions of economic integration and the problems that come with it.

On Sunday, Macron won a smashing victory over right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen, making him the first president of France’s Fifth Republic (under the new constitution adopted in 1958) to be reelected without having to share power. It’s all but certain that Macron will use his second term—his party faces parliamentary elections in June—to further pursue his dream of a truly united “ sovereign Europe ” that speaks with one voice, especially in confronting Russia.\n\nFor a brief historic moment, just after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world witnessed what appeared to be a new spirit of unity between France and Germany. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Feb. 27 declaration of Zeitenwende, or “ the turning of an era ”—meaning a dramatically stepped-up defense and independent energy policy—seemed to reinvigorate the fading idea of the West and imbue the European Union with a new sense of higher purpose. It was just the sort of reinvention that French President Emmanuel Macron has been demanding for years.\n\nFor a brief historic moment, just after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world witnessed what appeared to be a new spirit of unity between France and Germany.

It’s all but certain that Macron will use his second term—his party faces parliamentary elections in June—to further pursue his dream of a truly united “sovereign Europe” that speaks with one voice, especially in confronting Russia.\n\nYet Scholz and his ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) may be going in a different direction. Despite urgent calls for Germany to reduce or eliminate its energy dependence on Russia in the aftermath of President Vladimir Putin’s aggression, Scholz in recent days has stated clearly this is not going to happen anytime soon. He told Der Spiegel in an interview published on April 22 that an embargo on Russian gas wouldn’t affect Putin’s plans and only cause a “dramatic economic crisis” in Germany. Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer. It is probably no longer politically tenable for German politicians to find ways of accommodating Putin, and Germany must at long last wrestle with a reality it has long avoided: Building nuclear power plants is perhaps the only viable path to something close to energy independence.\n\nMacron may realize he has other problems as well; although he outpolled the insurgent Le Pen by 17 percentage points, his right-wing opponent delivered her best showing ever by playing on the fears of rising energy prices stemming partly from Western boycotts, among other issues. At a victory rally, Macron declared that “an answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right.” That includes developing a new policy toward a hostile Russia.\n\n“France needs a better Ostpolitik, and Scholz’s Germany doesn’t seem to have a Europe policy,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution. “Neither of them has really come to grips with what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means for the European security order.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/olaf-scholz-macron-G-7-germany-GettyImages-1238300895.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:16'}

It was not disclosed who exactly in the Ukrainian leadership made this decision. In any case, Steinmeier was not able to join the small group of other European presidents who were warmly received in in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nWhy did this happen to the German president? In this question, you could stress both the word "German" and the word "president." I am not certain which of them should be stressed more.\n\nChummy approach\n\nFirst, however, a brief look back at a personal story of mine. In the late summer of 2016, I was in the German city of Weimar, where I was awarded the Goethe Medal along with a prominent Nigerian photographer and a no less prominent Georgian archaeologist.\n\nThe official program included a meeting with three foreign ministers. As a reminder, Germany, Poland and France form the so-called "Weimar Triangle" — the foreign ministers of the three countries meet from time to time, not necessarily in Weimar, but that\'s where it was back then. According to the program, the ministers were scheduled to congratulate the three new laureates.\n\nUkrainian writer Yuri Andrukhovych\n\nOur meeting lasted between one and three minutes at the most. The French foreign minister seemed a little bored, perhaps he was just tired. The Polish foreign minister seemed unhappy with something and grumpy. Only Steinmeier, Germany\'s foreign minister at the time, was affable — it seemed he could hardly keep from patting us on the shoulder or back.\n\nThen he said something like "Oh, well done, congratulations... The Goethe Medal! Great, great... can anyone tell me what it is awarded for — what merits?" That\'s how he spoke to the three of us. It all happened quickly, and no one really listened to our answers. When the TV cameras had their shots, the trio of ministers moved on.\n\nModel Putin sympathizer\n\nAkinbode Akinbiyi, David Lordkipanidze and I later exchanged our impressions of this so-called "meeting." We agreed that it all seemed rather unprofessional and that we regarded Steinmeier\'s question as more of a joke, albeit a bad one. Otherwise, it would have been even more sad. None of us had expected the ministers to bow to us. But this obvious superficiality — and the less obvious but perceptible arrogance — was disappointing to us.\n\nIt was particularly disappointing to me — after all, I came from the country for which Frank-Walter Steinmeier had come up with his infamous formula. I don\'t want to claim that it played a decisive role in his further career or that it is the reason Steinmeier was elected President twice. But I can say with certainty that it is precisely because of this formula that Ukrainian society sees him as a model of a Putin sympathizer, and almost as an "agent of Moscow."\n\nWritten by Moscow?\n\nThe infamous formula which lost all meaning on February 24 was de facto intended to cement Ukraine\'s surrender in the Donbas. It matches Putin\'s plans to such an extent that the Ukrainians understandably attributed its true authorship to Moscow. Allegedly, Steinmeier was adhering to the wishes of his Russian friends and agreed to lend his name and suggested auhorship to a project that was disasterous for Ukraine. If secret diplomacy is considered to evil par excellence, the current German president holds the copyright to its embodiment — at least in the eyes of many Ukrainians.\n\nI do not think Steinmeier is aware of how often Ukrainian media, especially since 2019, have mentioned his name along with the word "formula." It is not an exaggeration to say it was thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of times. Along with this "popularity" comes an avalanche of criticism, distrust and outright rejection. For Ukrainians, the "Steinmeier formula" has become a synonym for something insidious and threatening, a kind of Trojan horse for the destruction of Ukrainian statehood.\n\nUnrivaled unpopularity\n\nPerhaps the "author" himself, who has long since moved to a higher, if rather decorative, position, has already forgotten the essence of the formula he invented. But Ukraine has not forgotten, it has remembered all these years, almost daily, almost always with a curse and always in connection with the name Steinmeier. On the list of German politicians most disliked by Ukrainians, Steinmeier comes second only to his old boss, ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. As for current politically active personalities, no one comes close to Steinmeier\'s unpopularity.\n\nUkrainians are wary when they see photos like this one of Steinmeier and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\n\nWith Steinmeier\'s example in mind, Germany\'s elite should recognize how much damage their ambiguous policies during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict have done since 2014. In the process, they have not only harmed Ukraine, but also themselves: Branded as a partner who is extremely unreliable, cynical, and cunning, whose words egregiously diverge from their actions. As a result, Germany has lost its relevance and — thanks to the efforts of both the previous and current federal government — has become an outsider.\n\n\'Unimportant president of an unimportant country\'\n\nUkrainian society and the country\'s leadership, which is heavily dependent on public opinion, clearly felt the moment when the United States and Britain filled the vacuum — the moment they were able to say "no" even to German President Steinmeier and had to do so for strategic reasons.\n\nBut the "unimportant president of an unimportant country" can radically fix that situation. Germany as a whole can recover its role in the eyes of Ukrainians — in particular as neither the US nor Britain are involved: in providing effective and committed support to Ukraine on the road to EU membership. Germany should do so, however without flirting with the aggressor and the ambiguities that go with it.\n\nYuri Andrukhovych is a Ukrainian writer, poet, essayist and translator.

The Kremlin has argued that because of this, Ukraine\'s national identity is virtually identical to Russia\'s; Kyiv strongly objects.\n\nMeanwhile, Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world\'s Eastern Orthodox Christians, called from Istanbul for humanitarian corridors to be opened in Ukraine where he said "an indescribable human tragedy is unfolding."\n\n"We call once again for an immediate end to the fratricidal war, which, like any war, undermines human dignity," Bartholomew added.\n\nSwitzerland impedes German arms deliveries: report\n\nSwitzerland has blocked the re-export from Germany to Ukraine of Swiss-produced ammunition used in German-made Marder infantry fighting vehicles, according to the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.\n\nThe move by Switzerland, which maintains a neutral status, has held up arms deliveries by Germany at a time when Berlin is already under fire for failing to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons to help fight off Russia\'s invasion of the country.\n\nSwitzerland has gone against previous practice and adopted EU sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for its invasion, but has insisted its neutrality does not allow it to send arms to conflict zones. Swiss officials have previously rejected Poland\'s request for the Alpine state to send arms to Ukraine.\n\nThe Marder vehicles are made by German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall but use Swiss-manufactured ammunition.\n\nUK says Russian troops suffer from poor morale\n\nRussia has made "some territorial gains" since starting the ongoing offensive in the east of the country, according to UK military intelligence. At the same time, UK officials said that Ukraine provided strong resistance and inflicted significant losses on the Russian forces.\n\n"Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness," they said on Twitter.\n\nUkraine governor says Russian attacks killed 8 in Luhansk\n\nRussian shelling killed eight people and injured two more in Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, according to governor Serhiy Gaidai. The Ukrainian official two more people were seriously injured, and no less than eight buildings were destroyed in the region, which is partially controlled by pro-Russian rebels.\n\nThe numbers could not be independently verified.\n\nWatch video 02:39 North of Kyiv, battle of Teterivske demonstrates \'imprecise\' Russian military style\n\nGermany reportedly to buy Chinook heavy transport helicopters\n\nGermany would buy 60 CH-47F Chinook heavy transport helicopters from Boeing worth around €5 billion ($5.4 billion), Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported, citing government sources.\n\nDeliveries would begin after 2025-2026, and the helicopters are said to replace the aging CH-53G Stallion rotorcraft.\n\nThe paper said the project will be funded from the €100 billion fund Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced in February to modernize the military.\n\nThe paper said Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht would inform the parliament of the decision next week, but a spokesperson for the ministry said no decision on helicopter purchases had been made yet.\n\nOpposition leader calls for German foreign and security policy review\n\nThe leader of Germany\'s opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, has called for a review of German foreign and security policies over the past two decades.\n\n"The entire German foreign and security policies of the past 20 years are in ruins. When this war is over, we must carefully analyze how this happened," he told newspaper Bild am Sonntag.\n\nHe did not spare his own party, saying "serious failures" were made on defense over the past two decades.\n\n"Looking back, we must, unfortunately, say that all defense ministers of the past 20 years made wrong decisions about materiel and the condition of troops," Merz said.\n\nWatch video 04:21 Are Ukrainian forces getting everything they need?\n\nFrom the end of 2005 to the end of 2021, the CDU and its sister party, the CSU, held the Ministry of Defense.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a plan to beef up the German military in February, pledging a special package of €100 billion ($112.7 billion) to boost the strength of the country\'s armed forces.\n\nHe also vowed to increase Germany’s annual defense spending to 2% of the nation’s GDP, in line with NATO demands.\n\nUN Chief to stop in Turkey before visits to Russia and Ukraine\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will visit Turkey on Monday before heading to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and then to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the UN said in a statement.\n\nIn the Turkish capital Ankara, Guterres will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nTurkey has been trying to negotiate an end to the conflict, so far without success.\n\nOn Tuesday, Guterres will meet Putin in Moscow, followed by a trip Thursday to Kyiv in an effort to mediate an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy criticized Guterres\'s decision to head to Moscow before Kyiv, saying there is "no justice and no logic in this order."\n\n"The war is in Ukraine, there are no bodies in the streets of Moscow. It would be logical to go first to Ukraine, to see the people there, the consequences of the occupation," Zelenskyy said.\n\nUkraine blames Russian troops for forcibly recruiting civilians\n\nUkraine has accused Russian troops of forcibly recruiting civilians in occupied regions of eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to young people, doctors were being targeted in the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv regions, Ukrainian military officials wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe UK\'s Ministry of Defense also noted similar conscription practices in the Russian-occupied Donbas and Crimea.\n\n"Any enlistment of Ukrainian civilians into the Russian armed forces, even if presented by Russia as being voluntary or military service in accordance with Russian law, would constitute a violation of Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention," the UK Ministry of Defense wrote on Twitter.\n\nIAEA to provide Ukraine with equipment to keep nuclear plants running\n\nUkraine has asked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the equipment it needs to operate nuclear power plants during the war with Russia.\n\nThe agency says it includes radiation measurement devices, protective material, computer-related assistance, power supply systems, and diesel generators.\n\n"We will coordinate the implementation of the assistance that the IAEA and its member states will provide, including by delivering required equipment directly to Ukraine\'s nuclear sites," IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said.\n\nUkraine has 15 operational reactors at four plants.\n\nGrossi was due to visit the decommissioned Chernobyl plant next week, on the anniversary of the 1986 disaster there.\n\nPutin in church as Ukrainians told to stay home\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attended an Easter mass conducted by the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow.\n\nThe church has strongly backed the Kremlin leader\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPutin did not speak during the service.\n\nPatriarch Kirill said he hoped the conflict in Ukraine would end quickly but did not condemn it.\n\nHis previous statements backing Russia\'s invasion have splintered the worldwide Orthodox Church.\n\nOn Sunday, many Ukrainians will observe Easter, but they were told to attend service virtually as authorities there have announced a nationwide curfew.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nZelenksyy to meet Blinken and Austin in Kyiv\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expecting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to visit Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt would be the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war two months ago.\n\nZelenskyy had high hopes for the encounter, saying Ukraine was expecting more weapons to counter the Russian invasion.

Kyiv won 3-2 in a charity match played in front of about 35,000 fans. All proceeds will go to victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n"It is about sending a signal, a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, earning a bit of money so that we can do one or the other humanitarian action. And then it is also a sign against this despicable war of aggression," Dortmund managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke told broadcasters ZDF.\n\nKyiv has played similar fund-raising matches in Warsaw, Istanbul and Cluj.\n\nPutin claims he hopes for diplomatic agreement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Moscow. In televised remarks, he told Guterres that he still hoped for negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject [talks]," Putin told Guterres, who was visiting Moscow.\n\nHe said talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv. He claimed without evidence, that the massacres in Bucha were not carried out by Russians.\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nGuterres reiterated his call for Ukraine and Russia to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe broadcast discussions showed Guterres and Putin sitting opposite each other at the large oval table in the hall of the Senate Palace, following an hour-long meeting in the Kremlin.

It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense. Speaking at the event, Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense, told reporters that "we have to move at the speed of war."\n\nAustin said the US was determined to make better use of the US European Command\'s coordination mechanism and would extend the forum for Ukraine\'s defense into a monthly contact group.\n\n"We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and make it less able to do that," Austin said.\n\nAustin went on to express sharp criticism of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who warned on Monday that World War III might be looming.\n\n"You\'ve heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful," Austin said. "Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence. The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing.

The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield.

How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes.

Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk. The Russian report said oil storage tanks at the facility caught fire around 2 a.m. local time.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires show a burning fire at coordinates that correspond to a Rosneft facility some 70 miles north of the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, adviser to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was cited by the Ukrainian news agency Unian as saying that people who live near the burning oil depot were being evacuated.\n\nMoscow has previously blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s top security officials have denied that Kyiv was behind an earlier airstrike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 35 miles from the border.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin Meet With Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country’s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nIt came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia’s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n“Yes, they’re meeting with the president. Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:40'}

Credit: Wikipedia - Government.ru Novy Urengoy CC BY 3.0\n\nPoland and Bulgaria will both see their gas supplies turned off by Gazprom in Russia\n\n\n\nAs of today, Wednesday, April 27, Moscow has stopped Russian gas from flowing through the pipes of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline that supplies Poland, and also Germany. In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries. The ministry said the blaze damaged a depot containing diesel fuel. It said the region has enough diesel for 15 days.\n\nIt was not clear if the depot was part of the pipeline infrastructure, but Polish pipelines operator PERN said deliveries to Poland have not been affected.\n\nA Russian news report said another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire on Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nLast month, two Ukrainian helicopter gunships hit an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Mr Zelensky described his meeting with Mr Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging and, importantly, effective”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nWith Russia’s shift in focus towards the Donbas, Mr Zelensky is now focused on more heavy weaponry, such as tanks and artillery.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\n“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory,” Mr Austin said. “We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nIn a boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term on Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to loosen France’s ties to the European Union and Nato.\n\nMs Le Pen had spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.', 'image': 'https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/13713011/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:05'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene," the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media.\n\n3:37pm: Ukraine war has consequences for Asia, EU chief warns neutral India\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine threatens India\'s regional security, the European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Monday during a trip to New Delhi aimed at fostering deeper strategic ties.\n\nVon der Leyen is the latest visiting Western diplomat to press India, which gets most of its arms from Russia, over its neutral stance on the conflict.\n\nBoth the EU and India face challenges from a rising China, and von der Leyen raised the spectre of Beijing\'s partnership with Moscow to warn the war had consequences further afield than Europe.\n\n"The outcome of the war will not only determine the future of Europe but also deeply affect the Indo-Pacific region," she told an audience at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitical conference in New Delhi.\n\n"Russia and China have forged a seemingly unrestrained pact. They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war. Since the beginning of April, just under 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, after some 3.4 million left in March.\n\nThe UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an additional 218,000 citizens of third countries—largely students and migrant workers—have also fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began.\n\nWomen and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.\n\nBeyond the refugees, the IOM estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Ukrainian children have had to flee their homes, including those who remain in the country.\n\n2:45pm: Visit by top US officials sign of improved security situation in Kyiv\n\nA visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday is a strong sign that the security situation in Ukraine\'s capital has improved.

EU countries have largely refused that demand, saying it breaks contracts denominated in dollars and euros.\n\nThe European Commission said that such payments would violate EU sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nPGNiG said it continued "to settle its liabilities for natural gas delivered under the Yamal Contract in accordance with its current terms."\n\nThe Polish utility demanded that Gazprom resume gas deliveries.

The new Russian payment system is "at odds with the agreement that is effective until the end of this year and poses considerable risks for the Bulgarian side," said the energy ministry.\n\nPoland has vowed to end imports of Russian coal, gas and oil, and is pressing other EU countries to rapidly do the same.\n\n"We are prepared for the complete cut off of Russian fossil fuels," Polish Energy Minister Anna Moskwa said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nPoland gets 46 percent of its gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia, according to Forum Energii, a think tank.\n\nPolish authorities insisted that the cutoff won\'t affect gas users.\n\n"Thanks to the implementation of the government\'s strategy of diversifying gas supply sources, PGNiG is prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on the western and southern borders and the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście," said PGNiG.\n\nMoskwa said: "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security," adding that the country\'s gas storage was 80 percent full. She said Poland will continue to buy gas on European and international markets and aims to fill its reserves to 100 percent.\n\nBulgaria, which gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia, said it has "taken steps to ensure alternative supplies of natural gas and handle the situation.

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer. It is probably no longer politically tenable for German politicians to find ways of accommodating Putin, and Germany must at long last wrestle with a reality it has long avoided: Building nuclear power plants is perhaps the only viable path to something close to energy independence.\n\nMacron may realize he has other problems as well; although he outpolled the insurgent Le Pen by 17 percentage points, his right-wing opponent delivered her best showing ever by playing on the fears of rising energy prices stemming partly from Western boycotts, among other issues. At a victory rally, Macron declared that “an answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right.” That includes developing a new policy toward a hostile Russia.\n\n“France needs a better Ostpolitik, and Scholz’s Germany doesn’t seem to have a Europe policy,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution. “Neither of them has really come to grips with what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means for the European security order.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/olaf-scholz-macron-G-7-germany-GettyImages-1238300895.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:16'}

This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the biggest Orthodox holiday," Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also spoke about yesterday\'s visit by top US officials.

"That has failed."\n\nBlinken said that Russia\'s military was underperforming and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin\'s on the scene," Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees "final success."\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "things are beginning to get back to normal" in Kyiv, but noted that "that\'s in stark contrast to what\'s going on" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas — UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain\'s defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, "Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials.

And that makes it a threat to all of us," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said\n\nNew Zealand was physically distanced from the conflict but "inextricably linked" to what it represented, Ardern added.\n\nAcross the Tasman sea, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the people of Ukraine, who are fighting a Russian invasion.\n\n"On this particular day, as we honor those who fought for our liberty and freedom, we stand with the people of Ukraine who do the same thing at this very moment," Morrison said.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nSummary of Sunday\'s events in Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv.

Kyiv won 3-2 in a charity match played in front of about 35,000 fans. All proceeds will go to victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n"It is about sending a signal, a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, earning a bit of money so that we can do one or the other humanitarian action. And then it is also a sign against this despicable war of aggression," Dortmund managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke told broadcasters ZDF.\n\nKyiv has played similar fund-raising matches in Warsaw, Istanbul and Cluj.\n\nPutin claims he hopes for diplomatic agreement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Moscow. In televised remarks, he told Guterres that he still hoped for negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject [talks]," Putin told Guterres, who was visiting Moscow.\n\nHe said talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv. He claimed without evidence, that the massacres in Bucha were not carried out by Russians.\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nGuterres reiterated his call for Ukraine and Russia to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe broadcast discussions showed Guterres and Putin sitting opposite each other at the large oval table in the hall of the Senate Palace, following an hour-long meeting in the Kremlin.

It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense. Speaking at the event, Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense, told reporters that "we have to move at the speed of war."\n\nAustin said the US was determined to make better use of the US European Command\'s coordination mechanism and would extend the forum for Ukraine\'s defense into a monthly contact group.\n\n"We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and make it less able to do that," Austin said.\n\nAustin went on to express sharp criticism of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who warned on Monday that World War III might be looming.\n\n"You\'ve heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful," Austin said. "Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region.

The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow.

And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes. Russia\'s Defense Ministry claimed it used missiles to destroy facilities powering the railways supplying Ukrainian forces with foreign weapons.\n\nAbout 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. Ukraine has claimed 22,000 Russian troops were killed since the invasion. Russia has acknowledged only 1,351 military deaths.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalize parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims.\n\nAfter a visit to Kyiv, Blinken said Russia\'s military was underperforming, and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nWatch video 02:54 Russian missiles strike Ukrainian rail stations\n\nYou can revisit our live updates from April 25 here.\n\nsi, lo, aw/wmr, rs, mhm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61602081_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:44'}

The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol.

Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk. The Russian report said oil storage tanks at the facility caught fire around 2 a.m. local time.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires show a burning fire at coordinates that correspond to a Rosneft facility some 70 miles north of the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, adviser to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was cited by the Ukrainian news agency Unian as saying that people who live near the burning oil depot were being evacuated.\n\nMoscow has previously blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s top security officials have denied that Kyiv was behind an earlier airstrike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 35 miles from the border.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin Meet With Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country’s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nIt came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia’s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n“Yes, they’re meeting with the president. Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:40'}

Credit: Wikipedia - Government.ru Novy Urengoy CC BY 3.0\n\nPoland and Bulgaria will both see their gas supplies turned off by Gazprom in Russia\n\n\n\nAs of today, Wednesday, April 27, Moscow has stopped Russian gas from flowing through the pipes of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline that supplies Poland, and also Germany. In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nAs both sides in the war brace for what could be a grinding battle of attrition in the country’s eastern industrial heartland, top US officials pledged more help to ensure Ukraine prevails.\n\nIn a bold visit to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the American secretaries of state and defence said Washington had approved a 165 million dollar (£129 million) sale of ammunition – non-US ammo, mainly if not entirely to fit Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons – along with more than 300 million dollars (£235 million) in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said after the meeting that the West’s united support for Ukraine and pressure on Moscow are having “real results”.\n\n“When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the American support but said that “as long as Russian soldiers put a foot on Ukrainian soil, nothing is enough”.\n\nMr Kuleba warned that if western powers want Ukraine to win the war and “stop Putin in Ukraine and not to allow him to go further, deeper into Europe”, then countries need to speed up the delivery of the weapons requested by Ukraine.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to “split Russian society and to destroy Russia from within”.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv and perhaps the toppling of its government. But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries. The ministry said the blaze damaged a depot containing diesel fuel. It said the region has enough diesel for 15 days.\n\nIt was not clear if the depot was part of the pipeline infrastructure, but Polish pipelines operator PERN said deliveries to Poland have not been affected.\n\nA Russian news report said another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire on Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nLast month, two Ukrainian helicopter gunships hit an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Mr Zelensky described his meeting with Mr Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging and, importantly, effective”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nWith Russia’s shift in focus towards the Donbas, Mr Zelensky is now focused on more heavy weaponry, such as tanks and artillery.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\n“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory,” Mr Austin said. “We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nIn a boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term on Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to loosen France’s ties to the European Union and Nato.\n\nMs Le Pen had spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.', 'image': 'https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/13713011/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:05'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene," the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media.\n\n3:37pm: Ukraine war has consequences for Asia, EU chief warns neutral India\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine threatens India\'s regional security, the European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Monday during a trip to New Delhi aimed at fostering deeper strategic ties.\n\nVon der Leyen is the latest visiting Western diplomat to press India, which gets most of its arms from Russia, over its neutral stance on the conflict.\n\nBoth the EU and India face challenges from a rising China, and von der Leyen raised the spectre of Beijing\'s partnership with Moscow to warn the war had consequences further afield than Europe.\n\n"The outcome of the war will not only determine the future of Europe but also deeply affect the Indo-Pacific region," she told an audience at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitical conference in New Delhi.\n\n"Russia and China have forged a seemingly unrestrained pact. They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war. Since the beginning of April, just under 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, after some 3.4 million left in March.\n\nThe UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an additional 218,000 citizens of third countries—largely students and migrant workers—have also fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began.\n\nWomen and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.\n\nBeyond the refugees, the IOM estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Ukrainian children have had to flee their homes, including those who remain in the country.\n\n2:45pm: Visit by top US officials sign of improved security situation in Kyiv\n\nA visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday is a strong sign that the security situation in Ukraine\'s capital has improved.

"The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win," he said. "We believe that we can win, they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support."\n\n7:41am: UK says Russia made minor advances in Ukraine after its shift to Donbas\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the eastern Donbas region, the UK\'s Ministry of Defence has tweeted.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nUkraine\'s defence of the southern city of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 25 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/7NVrOfB161\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/OfcnHgGfR3 — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 25, 2022\n\n6:41am: US aid to Ukraine and neighbours, diplomatic presence in Kyiv\n\nDuring their visit to Kyiv on Sunday – the highest-level US visit since the Russian invasion on February 24 – Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his advisers that the US would provide more than $300 million in foreign military financing and had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition.\n\nMoney will also go to Ukraine\'s regional allies who need to resupply after sending weapons to their neighbour.\n\nThey also said US President Joe Biden would soon announce his nominee for ambassador to Ukraine and that US diplomats who left Ukraine before the war would start returning to the country this coming week.

As Jourová indicated, banking sector sanctions are highly likely to be accepted as there are signs of a consensus among the EU countries.\n\nThe European Commission wants to widen the sanction list to include more people and entities.\n\nThe EU has already imposed five rounds of sanctions against Russia, including an embargo on Russian coal imports and a ban on Russian and Belarusian freight road operators working in the EU.', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57600345-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:24'}

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

"We are here to support you in any way possible."\n\nSaid Blinken: "The reason we\'re back is because of you, because of the extraordinary courage, leadership and success that you\'ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression."\n\nUS officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for Zelensky\'s government and other countries in the region. An extra $322 million in military aid for Ukraine would take total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, one official said.\n\n"It will provide support for capabilities Ukraine needs, especially the fight in the Donbas," the official said. It would also help Ukraine\'s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defence systems -- essentially NATO capable systems, the official added on condition of anonymity.\n\nWestern arms for Ukraine have infuriated Moscow. Russia\'s ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note stressing "the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice".\n\nThe meeting between the US delegation and Ukraine\'s leaders ran for three hours, or more than double the allotted time, a US official said.\n\n"In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded," Blinken told a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine\'s government.

Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot. There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\'s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nIn a daily update on the conflict, Britain\'s defence ministry said Russia had only made minor advances in some parts of Donbas.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nIn an emotional address at Kyiv\'s 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral to mark the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday, Zelensky said his nation would overcome "dark times".\n\nWAR GRINDS ON\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country, where the war grinds on relentlessly.\n\nSome 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\nRussia also fired rockets at two towns in the central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\nUkraine\'s general staff described Russian shelling and assaults along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steel works in Mariupol where the last Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a city destroyed during two months of Russian siege and bombardment.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation", denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, Britain\'s The Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.', 'image': 'https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/04/25/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg/BINARY/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:55'}

Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer.

In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence. The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing. Mantoo added that Syria has the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled the country.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nUN doubles Ukraine aid appeal to $2.25 billion\n\nThe United Nations\' humanitarian agency (UN OCHA) said that it has been forced to double its aid appeal to $2.25 billion (€2.11 billion) as the humanitarian situation in the country worsens.\n\n"Over $2.25 billion is now required for needs inside Ukraine, more than double of the amount requested ($1.1 billion) when we launched the appeal on 1 March, a few days after the war began," the UN OCHA said in a statement.\n\nUS, allies will \'move heaven and Earth\' to meet Ukrainian security requirements — Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the aim of the conference at the air base in Ramstein, Germany was to "help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion," as well as to "build up Ukraine\'s defenses for tomorrow\'s challenges."\n\nAustin said that he discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Kyiv\'s "changing requirements" as Russia focuses on Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region. Austin said that the US and its allies will "keep moving heaven and Earth" to meet Ukraine\'s security requirements.\n\n"Ukraine needs our help to win today, and they will still need our help when the war is over," Austin said. He added that the US and its allies have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine\'s defense since the start of the war.\n\nThe defense secretary said that Ukraine "has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia\'s unprovoked invasion."\n\nAustin said that Ukraine\'s allies had provided assistance at "record speed," adding that "Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly."\n\nReferring to Russian troop withdrawal from areas around Ukraine\'s capital, Austin said that the war was "entering a new phase" following what he called "Russia\'s defeat at the battle of Kyiv."\n\n"Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man," Austin said, alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens."\n\nWatch video 01:06 Austin: \'We\'re here to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion\'\n\nExplosions hit radio facility in Russia-backed Trans-Dniester\n\nPolice in the breakaway Moldovan region of Trans-Dniester said that two explosions knocked two powerful antennas out of service in a radio facility close to Ukrainian border. The interior ministry of the region said those antennas were re-broadcasting Russian radio.\n\nThe incident occurred in a small town of Maiac about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the regional capital Tiraspol and roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said.\n\nThe explosions come just a day after several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the state security ministry in Tiraspol.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu is convening a meeting of the country\'s Supreme Security Council on Tuesday over incidents that took place in Trans-Dniester.\n\nTrans-Dniester is a narrow strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River, sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova. The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes.

Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk.

Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back.

Credit: Wikipedia - Government.ru Novy Urengoy CC BY 3.0\n\nPoland and Bulgaria will both see their gas supplies turned off by Gazprom in Russia\n\n\n\nAs of today, Wednesday, April 27, Moscow has stopped Russian gas from flowing through the pipes of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline that supplies Poland, and also Germany. In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nAs both sides in the war brace for what could be a grinding battle of attrition in the country’s eastern industrial heartland, top US officials pledged more help to ensure Ukraine prevails.\n\nIn a bold visit to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the American secretaries of state and defence said Washington had approved a 165 million dollar (£129 million) sale of ammunition – non-US ammo, mainly if not entirely to fit Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons – along with more than 300 million dollars (£235 million) in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said after the meeting that the West’s united support for Ukraine and pressure on Moscow are having “real results”.\n\n“When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the American support but said that “as long as Russian soldiers put a foot on Ukrainian soil, nothing is enough”.\n\nMr Kuleba warned that if western powers want Ukraine to win the war and “stop Putin in Ukraine and not to allow him to go further, deeper into Europe”, then countries need to speed up the delivery of the weapons requested by Ukraine.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to “split Russian society and to destroy Russia from within”.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv and perhaps the toppling of its government. But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries. The ministry said the blaze damaged a depot containing diesel fuel. It said the region has enough diesel for 15 days.\n\nIt was not clear if the depot was part of the pipeline infrastructure, but Polish pipelines operator PERN said deliveries to Poland have not been affected.\n\nA Russian news report said another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire on Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nLast month, two Ukrainian helicopter gunships hit an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Mr Zelensky described his meeting with Mr Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging and, importantly, effective”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nWith Russia’s shift in focus towards the Donbas, Mr Zelensky is now focused on more heavy weaponry, such as tanks and artillery.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\n“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory,” Mr Austin said. “We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nIn a boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term on Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to loosen France’s ties to the European Union and Nato.\n\nMs Le Pen had spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.', 'image': 'https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/13713011/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:05'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war.

EU countries have largely refused that demand, saying it breaks contracts denominated in dollars and euros.\n\nThe European Commission said that such payments would violate EU sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nPGNiG said it continued "to settle its liabilities for natural gas delivered under the Yamal Contract in accordance with its current terms."\n\nThe Polish utility demanded that Gazprom resume gas deliveries.

The new Russian payment system is "at odds with the agreement that is effective until the end of this year and poses considerable risks for the Bulgarian side," said the energy ministry.\n\nPoland has vowed to end imports of Russian coal, gas and oil, and is pressing other EU countries to rapidly do the same.\n\n"We are prepared for the complete cut off of Russian fossil fuels," Polish Energy Minister Anna Moskwa said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nPoland gets 46 percent of its gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia, according to Forum Energii, a think tank.\n\nPolish authorities insisted that the cutoff won\'t affect gas users.\n\n"Thanks to the implementation of the government\'s strategy of diversifying gas supply sources, PGNiG is prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on the western and southern borders and the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście," said PGNiG.\n\nMoskwa said: "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security," adding that the country\'s gas storage was 80 percent full. She said Poland will continue to buy gas on European and international markets and aims to fill its reserves to 100 percent.\n\nBulgaria, which gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia, said it has "taken steps to ensure alternative supplies of natural gas and handle the situation.

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

"We are here to support you in any way possible."\n\nSaid Blinken: "The reason we\'re back is because of you, because of the extraordinary courage, leadership and success that you\'ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression."\n\nUS officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for Zelensky\'s government and other countries in the region. An extra $322 million in military aid for Ukraine would take total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, one official said.\n\n"It will provide support for capabilities Ukraine needs, especially the fight in the Donbas," the official said. It would also help Ukraine\'s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defence systems -- essentially NATO capable systems, the official added on condition of anonymity.\n\nWestern arms for Ukraine have infuriated Moscow. Russia\'s ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note stressing "the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice".\n\nThe meeting between the US delegation and Ukraine\'s leaders ran for three hours, or more than double the allotted time, a US official said.\n\n"In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded," Blinken told a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine\'s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nJust weeks ago, Kyiv was a frontline city under curfew and bombardment, with tens of thousands of Russian troops massing on its northern outskirts. Residents spent nights huddled in its metro stations, sheltering from artillery.\n\nToday, the nearest Russian troops are hundreds of miles away, normal life is returning to the capital, Western leaders have been visiting and countries are reopening their embassies.\n\nBlinken said US diplomats would first return to Lviv in the west and should be back in Kyiv within weeks.\n\nBut despite Ukraine having repelled the assault on Kyiv, the war is far from over. Russia has regrouped its forces and sent more troops in to eastern Ukraine. Last week it launched a massive assault there in an attempt to capture eastern provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nRAILWAY STATIONS HIT\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying. Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot.

Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer. It is probably no longer politically tenable for German politicians to find ways of accommodating Putin, and Germany must at long last wrestle with a reality it has long avoided: Building nuclear power plants is perhaps the only viable path to something close to energy independence.\n\nMacron may realize he has other problems as well; although he outpolled the insurgent Le Pen by 17 percentage points, his right-wing opponent delivered her best showing ever by playing on the fears of rising energy prices stemming partly from Western boycotts, among other issues. At a victory rally, Macron declared that “an answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right.” That includes developing a new policy toward a hostile Russia.\n\n“France needs a better Ostpolitik, and Scholz’s Germany doesn’t seem to have a Europe policy,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution. “Neither of them has really come to grips with what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means for the European security order.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/olaf-scholz-macron-G-7-germany-GettyImages-1238300895.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:16'}

Berlin has not only hit the brakes when it comes to EU sanctions, but its refusal to supply heavy weapons to Ukraine has also reduced its leadership potential.\n\n“I think Germany has to be content now with playing at best the second, maybe even the third role in Europe. And that, of course, is partly due to the dithering and hesitation of Chancellor Olaf Scholz,” Vöpel said.\n\nAt the same time, the war has also exposed the weaknesses of its policies of the last few decades that concern Russia.\n\nWhile France always warned against too much economic dependence on Russia – especially concerning the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – Germany’s Russia policy was driven by the attempt to bring Russia closer to the West through closer economic integration. This approach has largely failed, considering Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Germany is also much more isolated than France in other areas. Macron, for example, has sought a close alliance with his Italian counterpart, Mario Draghi, on reforming European debt rules.\n\n“Particularly in the face of the current crises, Macron will try to work with Draghi to push for increased financial leeway to be able to shoulder the necessary investments,” emphasised Vöpel.\n\nAlthough Germany, in particular, has been hesitant to support the reform and the loosening of the EU’s fiscal rules, the balance of power in Europe has shifted toward the reform of rules, he added.\n\nGerman position in the EU\n\nHowever, Germany’s positions now coincide with Macron’s visions in many areas, most notably the attempt to foster European sovereignty.\n\nWhile Macron’s calls for a sovereign Europe in his keynote speech at the Sorbonne in 2017 were mainly left unanswered by the German government, the issue is now also topping the agenda in Germany. Scholz’s Zeitenwende is already profoundly anchored in German discourse and goes beyond the Ukraine war’s immediate effects.\n\nLast Wednesday, for example, Finance Minister Christian Lindner called for a complete strategic reset of German policy.\n\n“We have placed ourselves at a triple risk. We have become too dependent when it comes to energy from Russia, security from the U.S. and business with China,” Lindner told Focus Online. As a result, he said, Germany must now “re-found its business model.”\n\nGerman SPD MEP Udo Bullmann also stressed to EURACTIV that it was now necessary to strengthen European sovereignty.\n\nWhat is needed now is “a European policy full of self-confidence, but also full of clear objectives of peacekeeping, the international role of the European Union, and a new economic and development model in the face of climate change,” Bullmann said.\n\nMeanwhile, CEP Paris Director Marc Uzan also expressed confidence in the German ability to change.\n\n“Germany is at a turning point, and I think Berlin will be up to the challenge,” he told EURACTIV.\n\nAccording to him, France could also play a key role for Germany in this political upheaval.\n\n“Marcon could be the bridge to help Germany change its growth model and maybe its geopolitical model too,” Uzan stressed.\n\n[Edited by Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57538786-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But in the months leading up to Sunday\'s runoff, she sought to soften her party\'s hardline image over immigration in a bid to woo more voters.\n\nHowever, Le Pen did campaign to uphold a traditional French identity, while her promise to tackle the cost of living crisis also resonated with many voters.\n\nWatch video 00:59 Macron – winning over the hearts of reluctant voters\n\nMany supporters would have welcomed her softer stance on the EU — no longer threatening to quit the bloc. However, her criticism of NATO at a time of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine may have driven some people away.\n\nFresh accusations that she and other party aides allegedly embezzled EU funds during her time as a member of the European Parliament may also have hit her trust with voters, although she has denied the allegations.\n\nIn a speech to her supporters in Paris, Le Pen said she had "no hard feelings" over the defeat. But she warned that Macron\'s next term was likely to show as "much contempt and brutality" for the ordinary French voter as his previous term.\n\nHinting at her political future, the 53-year-old far-right politician said: "I\'m going to continue to work for France and French citizens with the dedication that you know that I am capable of," Le Pen said.\n\nDW Correspondent Barbara Wesel, reporting from Le Pen\'s campaign headquarters in Paris, said: "There is no natural successor, it really is a one-woman show.

I appreciate his support and I am convinced that we are moving together towards new common victories," Zelenskyy wrote in both Ukrainian and French.\n\nSince the conflict began, Macron said he had had "unpleasant" conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin — making the controversial decision to keep diplomatic channels open while also joining in international sanctions against Moscow.

France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nTalking to reporters on April 25, Johnson said it is “very important” to have a French president “who can be relied upon” on international issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s not right for friendly governments to comment on elections in neighbouring countries but what I can certainly say is that it is very, very important that Emmanuel and I have been able to work closely together on Ukraine over the last few weeks and months,” he said.\n\n“We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of NATO, has been absolutely vital for the stance we’ve taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I’m very, very reassured by that.”\n\nFrench President and La Republique en Marche party candidate for reelection Emmanuel Macron celebrates after his victory in France’s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

The French government has complained about the UK’s reluctance to issue fishing licences to French fishermen, claiming it was a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly expressed frustration over France’s alleged failure to prevent illegal immigrants from boarding small boats and crossing the English Channel into Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson, who led the Brexit campaign and took the UK out of the EU, has more common ground with Le Pen than Macron on the issue of EU membership.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, though she insisted during the election campaign she had no “secret agenda” this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nMarine Le Pen, presidential candidate, delivers her concession speech after early result projections show France’s incumbent President Emmanuel Macron heading to win a second five-year term as president, in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

During this election, finance minister Christian Lindner added that France was standing at the crossroads, stressing that “the united Europe is the biggest winner of this election.”\n\nHowever, the strong result of Le Pen has prompted concern. Ahead of Macron now lies the task of “rallying the French people, who voted strongly for right-wing and left-wing populists in this round of elections, probably out of disappointment, behind the political centre again,” Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesperson of the conservative CDU told EURACTIV.\n\nThe result is a “serious reminder” to the French president that “France now needs a social and ecological renewal” as France is facing “deep social divides,” a senior Social Democrat, MEP Udo Bullmann, told EURACTIV.\n\n“Emmanuel Macron’s election victory was more important for Europe than the German federal election. France has voted against right-wing populism and resentment and favoured President Macron’s Europe,” chancellor candidate for the CDU/CSU in 2021, Armin Laschet, told EURACTIV.\n\nAustrian and Dutch leaders also focused on the pro-EU signal of Macron’s victory.\n\nIn Rome, Madrid, Lisbon and Athens, leaders highlighted France’s commitment to the European project.\n\nIn Italy, Lega leader Matteo Salvini congratulated Le Pen, tweeting: “Congratulations, Marine! Alone against everyone, coherent and smiling, you have gathered the vote of 13 million French people, an unprecedented rate. Together for a Europe based on work, family, security, rights and freedom”.\n\nGreek MEP Stelios Kouloglou told EURACTIV that all polls show that disadvantaged French people support the far-right candidate as they feel marginalised by the political and social system. “Far-right demagogues are all over Europe are waiting if the problems of the vast majority are not solved.”\n\n“Five years is very little in history.

These are set to alter further the balance of power between the Socialists and the Republicains who have already imploded and are struggling to survive.\n\nInstead, the main opponents of Macron’s liberal, centrist La République En Marche are Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s far-left La France Insoumise and Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement national.\n\nWhat are the possible scenarios?\n\nAn “unlikely” far-right or far-left majority\n\nAccording to Thanassis Diamantopoulos, professor of political science at the University of Athens and expert on the French regime, the hypothesis of a far-right or far-left majority in the National Assembly is “unlikely”, despite the historically high scores of Le Pen and Mélenchon’s parties.\n\nIn France, the two-round majoritarian single-member electoral system means that “even with a majority, the far right and far left cannot win parliamentary elections. […] They have no potential to form an alliance”, and it is easier for “the forces around the centre to form an alliance”, Diamantopoulos told EURACTIV France.\n\nBut in recent days, Mélenchon has unequivocally called on his supporters: “I ask you to elect me Prime minister”.\n\nBetween the fact that “there will be no defections” in favour of Mélenchon’s party and the “under-representation of the extremes”, the possibility that his appeal will become a reality in the ballot box remains dim.\n\nAnother element that works against the most radical parties is that “there are two ‘anti-system’ expressions, one on the far right and the other on the left”.\n\nFor these reasons, eight deputies were elected under the banner of the Rassemblement National in 2017, despite qualifying for the second round of the presidential election, and Mélenchon’s party had seventeen. These results are far below the overall results at the national level.\n\nThe (new) attempt to unite the left\n\nOn the left, the urgent need for unity is being felt both by executives and voters, in order to regain influence and hope to impose a social and ecological majority on Macron.\n\nContacted by EURACTIV France, Sylvie Guillaume, a Socialist MEP, said she hoped that “the legislative elections [will make it possible to] restore a better balance because the presidential election is not a blank check” for the newly re-elected president.\n\nThe same is true of the Insoumis — Mélenchon’s supporters — who want to believe in uniting the left.\n\nMEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV France that her movement “appeals to those who do not feel represented” and admits to being in discussion with the other left-wing forces, to agree on “a common base”.\n\nThe call of Mélenchon and his supporters seem to have been heard by the other left-wing movements. Europe Ecologie Les Verts MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV France that “the political forces of the left and the ecologists must organise themselves to weigh together if they do not want to condemn themselves to lose separately”.\n\nLéon Deffontaines, president of the young communists’ movement, told EURACTIV France he hoped to see “the ideas of equality, sharing and solidarity become the majority again”.\n\nCommunist candidate Fabien Roussel pleaded on Sunday evening for a “global agreement” of the left, demanding that “local anchors and different sensibilities on the left be taken into account” in order to avoid the distribution benefiting only La France Insoumise, which largely dominated the left in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nYet, according to Diamantopoulos, even if “some constituencies [the left] could get some MPs elected” the idea of “getting close to a parliamentary majority is a political fiction”.\n\nWhat majority for Macron?\n\nDespite the parliamentary challenges, Macron will not throw in the towel.\n\nJudging by the comments of Gabriel Attal, spokesman for the outgoing government, confidence in Macron’s camp remains high.\n\n“I am convinced that the French will give the president of the republic the means to act to protect them, with a majority [in the National Assembly],” Attal told BFMTV-RMC on Monday morning.\n\nHaving limited manoeuvring room due to a lack of partisan alliances beyond the existing majority, Macron’s camp will try to convince voters of other political inclinations or, at best, conclude circumstantial agreements in the territories where this is possible.\n\nDiamantopoulos believes Macron could build a “presidential majority that would start with the former Gaullists (centre-right Républicains) and reach the hinge of the left, including perhaps even a part of the Socialist Party and, of course, the ecologists”.\n\nMacron must therefore, according to Diamantopoulos, “wink at the ecologists” the day after the election. His promise to appoint a prime minister “in charge of ecological planning” would be a step in this direction.\n\nBut the question is: when will this appointment take place? Diamantopoulos warned that this plan could be changed, depending on the results of the legislative elections, which will tilt the future government more to the right or the left, and thus define Macron’s alliance choices.\n\nAs a reminder, in 2017 he chose Edouard Philippe from the centre-right as prime minister, even though he was not forced to do so, having acquired a solid majority in the Assembly, as well as several other ministers from the right.\n\nAt the same time, Macron will also have to devote some of his energy to the French EU presidency.\n\n“He needs to ensure the ongoing French EU presidency is a success. It ends on June 30 and there is an upcoming conference on the Western Balkans to be organised soon, which provides an opportunity to start rethinking the EU’s enlargement policy,” Tara Varma of the European Council on Foreign Relations told EURACTIV in emailed comments.\n\n“Macron will have to take the mantle of European diplomatic leadership again. He mentioned Ukraine in his victory speech. He should travel to Kyiv immediately with (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz to demonstrate Europe’s support for Ukraine,” she said.\n\nBig relief after Macron's re-election but 'third round' ahead French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to unite a deeply divided nation after winning re-election on Sunday (24 April) in a battle against rival Marine Le Pen that saw the far right come its closest yet to taking power.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]", 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57636418-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

On Sunday, the sitting French president defeated Le Pen with 58.5 percent of the vote — provoking a sigh of relief from many environmental activists, despite their quarrels with Macron during his previous 5-year term.\n\nLe Pen’s energy plan had called for exiting the European Union’s electricity market, accelerating the development of nuclear power, and establishing a moratorium on wind and solar development. (Nuclear currently provides about 70 percent of the country’s electricity; wind and solar combined provide only about 10 percent.) “Wind turbines are ugly and they ruin our landscapes,” Le Pen said in the April 20 debate. The far-right candidate had also vowed to cut the value-added tax on gas, electricity, and oil from 20 percent to 5.5 percent — a move that would have cost the government up to 12 billion euros (nearly $12.9 billion) and boosted demand for fossil fuels.\n\nGrist relies on the support of generous readers like you to keep our climate news free.

Here's How\n\nThe president’s climate policies could also spill over into neighboring European countries. France is currently the leader of the European Union Council, which is tasked with implementing Europe’s “Green Deal” — a massive spending package designed to help the continent get off fossil fuels. And Macron has been one of the most outspoken critics of using Russian coal and oil in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, calling for an outright blockade on the import of those fuels into the E.U. “The results of elections in France always reverberate way beyond the country’s borders,” Lucie Mattera, head of European politics at the think tank E3G, told E&E News last week. “And 2022 is no exception.”\n\nBut critics have argued that the president struggled to implement his climate agenda during his first term. After promising to cut emissions in his first presidential election, in 2017, Macron instituted increases in France’s fuel tax, with the aim of reducing emissions from the transportation sector. The resulting price hike sparked the gilet jaunes, or “yellow vests” movement, with hundreds of thousands of French citizens protesting in the streets.\n\nChagrined, Macron repealed the tax increases and launched a program of public participation in government — including a Citizens’ Convention on Climate, a randomly selected group of 150 voters tasked with helping the country create new climate policy. The president promised to pass their proposals on to the legislature or to a referendum “without filter” — but there, too, he ran into conflict. After the convention released its 149 proposals, Macron preemptively vetoed three of them, including a tax on corporate profits to fund clean energy. Only a few dozen of the citizens’ suggestions ended up in France’s sweeping 2021 climate law, and those often in watered-down form.\n\nIn the short term, the reelected president has promised to create a new prime minister position focused on “ecological planning” and increase investments in renewable technologies. Part of that may be an act of political expediency: Macron was shifted left during the campaign by the popular primary run of the leftist candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who attracted many young voters with his calls for a 200 billion euro ($214 billion) investment in green infrastructure and a constitutional amendment to protect biodiversity. The support for Mélenchon, Macron said in a speech last week, had sent a “powerful message.”", 'image': 'https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron_election_presidential_climate.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

A Marine Le Pen presidency would have been a body blow for the EU on a par with Brexit. That crisis has been avoided.\n\nThe outpouring of congratulatory messages from EU leaders, with almost indecent haste, within minutes of the exit polls being published on Sunday evening was part of a huge collective sigh of relief in Brussels and most of Europe at President Macron’s re-election.\n\nThe decisive nature of his victory: 58.5% to 41.5% is a convincing win in anyone’s language and will also offer reassurance. But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France. In twenty years, the Le Pen vote has doubled from the 5.5 million votes collected by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2002. That has not translated into the keys to the presidential palace, but it should result in plenty of seats in the National Assembly.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that Le Pen or her successor will not be able to get closer to the presidency in five years, especially as there is no apparent heir to Macron, and En Marche is primarily a personal political vehicle without deep ideological roots.\n\nAt the same time, Le Pen and Eric Zemmour appear to have killed off the centre-right Republican party, which secured less than 5% in the first round and now lacks the cash to mount an effective campaign in the June legislative elections.\n\nThe June polls will be the real litmus test of the new configuration of French politics.\n\nShould Le Pen and Zemmour work together and mop up some of the Republican votes, it is hard to see how they will not win a sizeable number of seats. That in itself would be a major breakthrough and change the political landscape in Paris.\n\nThe Republicans and the Socialists currently hold 129 seats in the National Assembly compared to a mere six held by Le Pen’s Rassemblement National. But those two once-dominant parties have just obtained less than 7% of the vote between them in the first presidential round, less than Zemmour’s total and less than a third of Le Pen’s. It is hard to imagine how they can hold on to more than a fraction of these seats in June.\n\nThe French left, meanwhile, has also decisively changed shape.

Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

At the same time, most age groups were split more evenly between Macron and Le Pen; the only group that went all out for the incumbent president were the 18-to-24-year-olds. Yes, Generation Z, the post-millennials, saved Macron. And not so much because of their outpouring love for the president, but out of their fear of the alternative.\n\nThe French presidential election system was set up this way by President Charles de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic. The two-round system (no one gets 51% of the votes in the first round) often forces a second-round competition between a centrist and an extremist candidate, and the majority always prefers the centrist. Next, France will have a parliamentary election and the reelected Macron will campaign for the voters to give his party the majority so that his premiere would be from his own party and not, embarrassingly, from the opposition. He’ll get that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo, how come, on Monday morning, the euro fell 0.34% against the dollar, to $1.07725, close to its two-year low last week? Reuters suggested investors may be relieved to see that Le Pen is not in office, but this doesn’t mean they have high expectations of the winner. Still, the nationalist Le Pen promised to nationalize some key parts of France’s industry, cut taxes radically, and curtail France’s participation in the EU budget. The nightmare is over, investors, what’s holding y’all back?\n\nTurns out the future of the world’s economy is mired in anxiety: US stocks are not performing; futures are declining; China is being revisited by the pandemic it may have invented, so large chunks of its workforce are under lockdowns; supply chains are getting bogged down even worse than before; and Putin continues to try to salvage some measure of victory over Ukraine in time for May 9, the anniversary of the Red Army’s victory over the Nazis.\n\nThe dollar roared over in Israel, too, where it struck NIS 3.27 for the first time in who knows how long. It has probably more to do with the Fed raising interest rates recently than with French politics, but it couldn’t come at a better time, when Israel is struggling to retool its economy and restart its lavish exports again.\n\nMost French Jews heaved a sigh of relief over Macron’s win, especially Orthodox Jews – who would normally align with the right-wing candidate. The reason is that Le Pen, despite her cosmetic efforts, is more an old-fashion fascist than a modern-day extreme right-winger. As part of her fierce anti-immigration (some say xenophobic) policy, she promised to ban animal slaughter without stunning, insisting that stunning the animal is more humane. Of course, stunning renders the animal as “traif” for both Jews and Muslims, who threatened that they would leave France if they were deprived of their kosher and halal meat (If Le Pen Wins, She’ll Ban Kosher Shechita in France).\n\nAnd since France exports kosher meat, a ban on its production in France would have had a devastating impact on Jewish communities elsewhere, most notably in neighboring Switzerland.\n\nMany right-wing Israelis didn’t see a big distinction between Macron and Le Pen because both support the two-state solution and a Palestinian state. But if that’s your litmus test, then most Western and Third-World countries should be classified as anti-Israel. I thought Macron stood out as a friend a couple of weeks ago, when he clashed with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, calling him a “far-right antisemite.” So Emanuel can’t be all bad.\n\nHere’s what happened: Morawiecki compared the French president’s phone calls with Vladimir Putin to negotiating with Hitler. Now, you may support Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine or be against them, but they just don’t compare with what Hitler did to most of Europe and the rest of the planet. In response, Macron told Le Parisien that Morawiecki was trying to help Le Pen, and called him a “far-right antisemite who bans LGBT persons” in his country.\n\nA spokesman for Morawiecki said it was a lie and the Polish PM wasn’t an antisemite. But he kind of is. In 2018 he said Jews were involved in perpetrating the Holocaust (which would have been a brilliant solution to the supply chain problems). And Morawiecki is also behind the Polish law that punishes anyone who blames Poles for taking part in the Nazi Holocaust crimes.\n\nAnd, in June 2021, after Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called the new Polish law barring Jews from filing Holocaust restitution claims in Poland “immoral,” PM Morawiecki said, “I can only say that as long as I am the prime minister, Poland will not pay for German crimes: Neither zloty, nor euro, nor dollar.”\n\nSee?

The centre has held. Yesterday (24 April), 2022 stopped being 2022 just long enough for Emmanuel Macron to see off Marine Le Pen and secure re-election as the president of France. The result came as a great relief to millions around the world.\n\n\n\nMany are tempted to try and read into the result some grander narrative in which Europe remains a sort of liberal Hyperborea, a paradise from which the British expelled themselves in 2016 (together with Americans in electing Donald Trump). On closer inspection, however, this conception doesn’t quite square with the bald reality: the Rassemblement National (RN), a party explicitly rooted in the post-fascist far right, has just taken 41 per cent of the second-round vote in one of the European Union’s most important member states.\n\nAdmirers in Britain have long been prepared to overlook the unfortunate truth that France is home to one of the world’s largest white far-right parties. While Macron might have won yesterday’s election, the trend of the far right is only upward in France. Back in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, first broke through to contest the second round of the presidential election, French voters united around Jacques Chirac and rejected the Front National (as the RN was known at the time) by more than four to one. The elder Le Pen took less than 18 per cent of the second-round vote. Yet in 2017, his daughter Marine won more than 33 per cent – and yesterday, she won 41 per cent. Furthermore, while in Britain even the respectable right has serious trouble wooing younger voters, polling by YouGov has suggested that in France the RN is ahead with voters aged 18-24, as well as winning voters directly from the far left.\n\nFrance is not the only EU country to display this trend, however: there are plenty of other correctives for anyone who, despairing of the UK’s current government, might pine for a lost Eden across the English Channel. Across southern Europe the long political legacy of the EU’s tough response to the financial crisis plays out in the rise of right-wing parties that, like the RN, harbour more or less explicit links to historical anti-democratic movements. Italy not only contains the populist party Lega Nord but its smaller ally Fratelli d’Italia, whose logo features the familiar tricoloured flame of the postwar far right.\n\nRelated\n\nIn Spain meanwhile, Vox, a party with Francoist undertones, has outflanked Madrid’s traditional parties of the right on the question of Spanish unity, and secured its first beachhead in government. In eastern Europe, there is the organised, multinational challenge of the Visegrád Group; while in wealthy northern Europe, the social democratic Danish government recently adopted what Foreign Policy called “one of the harshest refugee policies in the world”.\n\nIn contrast, despite the performative toughness of the Rwanda proposals, the United Kingdom operates what the statistics show to be a pretty liberal immigration regime. Whatever its flaws, no sober observer can conflate the Conservative Party with the far-right movements gaining ground on the continent.\n\nNone of this is proof that Brexit was a good idea, of course, nor that France and Europe are not home to real liberal achievements. But we should accept that a country in which Le Pen takes 40 per cent of the vote is no nirvana.', 'image': 'https://www.newstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1236459286-1038x778.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:50'}

Western governments and rights groups strongly criticized the ruling, with one calling it “a travesty of justice of spectacular proportions.”\n\nThe court in Istanbul also sentenced seven other defendants, including 71-year-old architect Mucella Yapici, to 18 years in prison each for “aiding” the attempt. It ordered that the activists, who were not in custody, be immediately arrested, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\n\nThe verdict, which is likely to harm Turkey\'s ties with Western nations, comes as Europe’s top human rights body, the Council of Europe, launched infringement procedures against Turkey for refusing to abide by a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which in 2019 called for Kavala’s release on grounds that his rights had been violated.\n\nKavala, 64, has been jailed in Silivri prison, on the outskirts of Istanbul, since he was detained Oct. 18, 2017, accused of financing the protests. He and other defendants denied all the accusations and are expected to appeal the verdicts.\n\nHuman rights groups say Kavala was prosecuted with flimsy evidence and that the case is politically motivated. Kavala is the founder of a nonprofit organization, Anadolu Kultur, which focuses on cultural and artistic projects promoting peace and dialogue.\n\nSupporters of Kavala and the seven other defendants immediately protested the verdicts Monday, shouting slogans in support of the 2013 protests that morphed from a dispute over building a mall in an Istanbul park into wider demonstrations against the government of then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the verdict “blatantly contradicts the constitutional standards and international obligations that Turkey commits itself to as a member of the Council of Europe and EU accession candidate.”\n\n"We expect Osman Kavala to be released immediately -- the European Court of Human Rights has bindingly obliged Turkey to do so,“ Baerbock said.\n\nThe rights group PEN America called the verdict a “dark moment for Turkey” while Nils Muiznieks, Amnesty International’s director for Europe, said it amounted to a “travesty of justice of spectacular proportions.”\n\n“The court’s decision defies all logic. The prosecuting authorities have repeatedly failed to provide any evidence that substantiates the baseless charges of attempting to overthrow the government,” Muiznieks said in a statement. "We continue to call for Osman Kavala’s and his co-defendants’ immediate release as they appeal these draconian verdicts.”\n\nOzgur Ozel, an opposition legislator whose party frequently questions the independence of Turkey\'s courts, accused the judiciary of allegedly meeting the wishes of Erdogan, who is now president.\n\n“Justice did not prevail here today — the will of the person who rules this country was carried out,” he told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\nOzel also denounced the trial as an attempt by Erdogan to “demonize the protests that were extremely peaceful and were staged out of environmental concerns."\n\nAsked for his final words in court on Monday, Kavala said: “The aggravated life sentence demanded against me is an assassination that cannot be explained through legal reasons,” according to the Media and Law Studies Association group which has been monitoring the trial.\n\nIn his defense statements Friday, Kavala rejected the accusations once again, insisting that he had merely taken pastries and face masks to the protesters. He said allegations that he directed the protests are “not plausible.”\n\n“The fact that I spent 4.5 years of my life in prison is an irreparable loss for me. My only consolation is the possibility that my experience will contribute to a better understanding of the grave problems of the judiciary,” Kavala told the court by videoconference from Silivri.\n\nKavala was initially acquitted in February 2020 of charges that connected him with the 2013 Gezi Park protests. As supporters awaited his release, Kavala was rearrested on new charges linking him to Turkey\'s 2016 coup attempt. The acquittal was later overturned and the case was merged with that relating to the coup attempt, which the Turkish government blames on the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies any links to the attempted coup.\n\nThe court on Monday acquitted Kavala of charges linked to the coup attempt, saying there was insufficient evidence, Anadolu reported.\n\nIn October, Kavala’s continued detention sparked a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and 10 Western countries, including the United States, France and Germany, after they called for his release on the fourth anniversary of his imprisonment.\n\nErdogan has accused Kavala, of being the “Turkish branch” of billionaire U.S. philanthropist George Soros, whom the Turkish leader alleges has been behind insurrections in many countries. He has threatened to expel Western envoys for meddling in Turkey’s internal affairs.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights’ 2019 decision said Kavala’s imprisonment aimed to silence him and other human rights defenders and wasn’t supported by evidence of an offense.\n\nThe lengthy infringement process by the Council of Europe, a 47-member bloc that upholds human rights, could lead to the suspension of Turkey’s voting rights or membership in the organization.\n\nErdogan has dismissed the infringement process, saying Turkey would not “recognize those who do not recognize our courts.” Turkey had argued that Kavala’s detention was linked to the 2016 attempted coup and not the previous charges that were reviewed by the European court.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

disciplinary proceedings that could ultimately see Turkey’s membership suspended in the continent’s main human rights grouping.\n\nMuted by Ukraine war\n\nTurkey’s increasingly popular opposition leaders seized on the verdict one year ahead of a general election that could severely test Erdogan’s political survival skills.\n\nErdogan’s likely chief election rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu of the secular CHP party, called the 2013 protests “a national movement dedicated to solidarity, peace, brotherhood and democracy”.\n\nIstanbul’s politically ambitious opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, said the verdict “hurt the consciousness of millions of people”.\n\nYet the case’s importance to Turkey’s broader diplomatic standing has been somewhat muted by Russia’s two-month war in Ukraine.\n\nErdogan has been leveraging his relatively good ties with both Moscow and Kyiv to try and mediate an end to the conflict.\n\nHis efforts have already brought about a marked improvement in Ankara’s relations with Washington that could soon see Turkey supplied with US military jets.\n\nMonday’s hearing was held in Istanbul at the same time as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met

Do those claims hold up? Several of its explanations are listed below.\n\nGermany is simply following the lead of its allies\n\nThis has been Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s mantra since the outbreak of the war. He has said he\'s doing everything in close coordination with NATO and EU partners. "Look at what our allies are doing, for example our friends in the G7," he said at a press conference on Tuesday, pointing out that countries like Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States were supplying the same weapons that Germany was sending.\n\nBut on Thursday, the US announced a new military aid package worth $800 million (€740 million) for Ukraine, including for heavy artillery. That brings the total to more than $3 billion in aid since Russia launched its invasion on February 24.\n\nBy contrast, as of early April, the latest information that has been made available, German spending for Ukraine\'s military defense stood at around €186 million, according to the Economic Affairs Ministry. That was mainly used to buy rocket-propelled grenades, anti-aircraft rockets, machine guns, ammunition and protective gear — but not heavy weapons.\n\nProfessor Carlo Masala, a defense and security expert at the Bundeswehr University Munich, said Scholz is on the one hand delivering a message to the Russians by saying Germany is still holding back on heavy weapons. On the other hand, it\'s also a signal to the domestic audience and his center-left party, the Social Democrats.\n\n"This is an issue which is now being debated among various groups in the Social Democratic Party, and he needs them in parliament. He needs all those people who don\'t want to deliver heavy weapons because they think that this will escalate the conflict and that Germany will become a target of Russian activities," he told DW.\n\nWhile that\'s a justifiable concern, it\'s difficult to reconcile with the news that several Western countries, including the US, the UK and the Netherlands, have delivered heavy weapons, according to a recent tweet from Ukrainian lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko.\n\nThe Czech Republic has reportedly also signed off on sending several dozen Soviet-made T-72 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles. The US announced last week that it would quickly deliver 11 Russian-built Mi-17 helicopters, 200 M113 armored personnel carriers and 90 155-mm field howitzers with 40,000 artillery shells — all of which would qualify as heavy weapons.\n\nPer the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, heavy weapons refers to all tanks and armored vehicles, and all artillery 100 mm and above. Combat aircraft and combat helicopters are also classified as heavy weaponry.\n\nBundeswehr is stretched to its limits\n\nGermany has said it is unable to send more military aid to Ukraine, because it would then be unable to fulfill its national and NATO obligations.\n\n"Here, we now have to recognize that the options we have are reaching their limits," Scholz said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Bundeswehr has said it needs its heavy weapons to guarantee national and alliance defense obligations. This applies, for example, to Marder infantry fighting vehicles or the self-propelled howitzer 2000, a heavy artillery gun.\n\nWatch video 03:26 Why is Germany not sending heavy weapons?\n\n"In order to ensure the operability of our army, we need the weapons systems," Deputy Inspector General Markus Laubenthal told public broadcaster ZDF on Wednesday. He said the Marder tank is needed for national and NATO commitments.\n\nThe Marder is a combat system that includes guided missiles, handheld weapons and ammunition and requires extensive training. Although the training time could be shortened, "it is still a matter of weeks, and the equipment would have to be prepared," said Laubenthal.\n\nHis comments came in response to remarks by Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine\'s ambassador to Germany, one of the most vociferous critics of Berlin\'s approach.\n\n"The claim that the Bundeswehr would not be able to deliver anything to Ukraine is not comprehensible," Melnyk said recently. He said the force has around 400 Marders. Of those about 100 are used for training and could therefore be handed over to Ukraine immediately, he added.\n\nDefense expert Masala said the government is using this excuse as a pretext. "If the defense of NATO\'s territory depends on, let\'s say, 20 German tanks, then we shouldn\'t even try to defend NATO\'s territory because this would be disastrous," he said.\n\nAvailable arms are of no immediate use to Ukrainians\n\nThe government\'s argument is that the Ukrainian soldiers can only handle weapons they are familiar with. That includes the logistics of being able to carry out repairs with the corresponding spare parts.\n\nMasala sees this as a valid concern. "What happens if there is a problem, a technical problem with the Marder? You don\'t have the spare parts. You don\'t have the technicians who can repair it," he said. "You need to make sure that there is a logistics line going into Ukraine where they have spare parts, where they have trained technicians."\n\nThe question is whether it wouldn\'t be more effective to put the tanks in Ukrainians hands now and worry about logistics later. On that point, Masala agrees.\n\n"Train them to use the model, send them over to Ukraine. If they can use the Marder for three weeks, it\'s better than nothing. If the Marder breaks down, then OK, bad luck," he said. "In the meantime, we can work on the logistic chain for the supply of spare parts. So once again, it looks to me like a pretext not to send them because it\'s a political decision not to send heavy armor into Ukraine."\n\nWatch video 02:00 On the road with Ukraine\'s territorial defense force\n\nFormer NATO General Hans-Lothar Domröse is dismissive of the claims that extensive training would be required to master the Marder combat vehicles.\n\n"We\'re talking about seasoned Ukrainian commanders who have been fighting since 2014. They don\'t need to be told how to use them. Those who have been using the Soviet BMP-1 model can familiarize themselves with the Marder in under a week and operate it," he told public broadcaster WDR on Thursday.\n\nBerlin\'s response: More money, and a creative workaround\n\nScholz has said Berlin is releasing more than €1 billion to enable Ukraine to finance purchases of military equipment from Germany. He listed anti-tank weapons, air defense equipment and ammunition as examples, but did not mention the tanks and planes Ukraine has been asking for.\n\nBild reported that German defense companies initially offered to supply heavy weapons such as Marders, Boxer armored vehicles, Leopard 2 tanks and self-propelled howitzers. However, according to the daily tabloid, those items now appear to have been crossed off the list.\n\n"There are some heavy weapons on the list, but definitely not tanks. So, tanks seem to be a red line for the German government right now. Whether we can keep the red line depends, of course, very much on the development of the war in the coming weeks or months," said Masala.\n\nThe criticism of Germany\'s foot-dragging appears to have made an impression. On Thursday, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said at a press conference in Estonia that "there are no taboos for us with regard to armored vehicles and other weaponry that Ukraine needs," a reference to the possible supply of Marder vehicles.\n\nThe workaround for Germany appears to be a plan to backfill the stocks of allied countries that have weaponry to spare with modern German-made gear. As Germany\'s stocks are reportedly depleted, Eastern European NATO countries that still have Soviet-era weapons in their possession would "make these weapons available, as has already happened in several cases," said retired Bundeswehr Colonel Wolfgang Richter, a senior associate with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.\n\nDefense Minister Christine Lambrecht on Thursday confirmed the planned exchange with NATO and the EU. "We\'re talking about tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, it\'s about different options that individual countries have that they can hand over. We\'re in talks and it\'s happening very quickly now," Lambrecht told commercial broadcaster RTL/n-tv.\n\nOne option the government is working on is an exchange with Slovenia. The NATO partner would send several of its Soviet-era T-72 battle tanks to Ukraine; to compensate, Germany would then provide Slovenia with Marders from its own supplies.\n\nAnother creative workaround is reportedly being arranged with the Netherlands. "The Netherlands are going to send the self-propelled howitzer 2000, an extremely modern German weapon, and we\'re going to provide [the Ukrainians] with ammunition and the training, probably on German soil," said Masala.\n\nThis approach could relieve some of the pressure and deflect criticism. However, as Masala pointed out, it won\'t last long.\n\n"Our Eastern European partners are running out of old Soviet weaponry. And the Soviet tanks sent by Poland, Slovakia or Slovenia are going to be destroyed during this war," he said. "Ukraine will run out of these weapons too. At a certain point, the question will come back: whether to train Ukrainians and deliver modern Western weapon systems."\n\nMichael Trobridge contributed to this article.\n\nEdited by: Martin Kuebler', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61347239_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:53'}

Austin brought them together as a way of demonstrating visible support for Ukraine and improving the coordination of countries that have been rushing huge quantities of military assistance, including heavy weaponry, to help Kyiv fight back against the Russian invaders.\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday evening, Austin said the group would meet monthly going forward — a sign that Ukraine’s allies were preparing for a lengthy conflict.\n\n“We’re all determined to help Ukraine win today and build strength for tomorrow,” he said at a news conference following the day’s meetings.\n\n“To ensure that we continue to build on our progress, we’re going to extend this forum beyond today,” he continued. “I’m proud to announce that today’s gathering will become a monthly contact group on Ukraine’s self-defense, and the contact group will be a vehicle for nations of goodwill to intensify our efforts, and coordinate our assistance, and focus on winning today’s fight, and the struggles to come.”\n\nThe setting of the meeting — at a U.S. air base in Germany — seemed intended in part to rebuff a narrative coming from Moscow that Russia is waging a de facto war with NATO, which senior Russian officials claim is using Ukraine as a proxy.\n\n“NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with state-controlled media Monday night. “War means war.” The comments were striking in part because the Kremlin has refused to admit that it is waging war in Ukraine and instead has insisted on “special military operation” as a euphemism.\n\nHowever, the participant list in Germany, while mostly NATO countries, did stretch further around the globe to include Australia, Japan, Kenya, New Zealand, South Korea and Tunisia. There were no countries from Central or South America.\n\nBy contrast, the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, which the U.S. created in 2014, includes 84 countries.\n\nThe EU and NATO also participated in Tuesday’s meeting in Germany, though NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg was unable to attend because he had cold symptoms.\n\nAustin traveled to Ramstein following a visit on Sunday to Kyiv with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov also attended Tuesday’s event.\n\n“Ukraine has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia’s unprovoked invasion,” Austin said in opening remarks. “And Ukraine’s valor and skill will go down in military history. You know, the Battle of Iwo Jima took 36 days. The Battle of the Bulge lasted 40 days. And Ukraine has now beaten back the Russian military for 62 days. Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world, even greater resolve to NATO, and glory to Ukraine.”\n\nHe added that since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, over 30 allies and partners have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine. Of that, the U.S. has committed about $3.7 billion.\n\nAt Tuesday’s news conference, Austin was also pressed to clarify comments he had made in Poland on Monday saying the U.S. wanted to see Russia weakened.\n\nThe defense secretary said the goal of the U.S. was to help make sure Russia can no longer wage aggression against its neighbors.\n\n“We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and leave them less able to do that,” Austin said, before laying out the heavy losses Russia has suffered during its invasion of Ukraine. He added: “So we would like to make sure, again, that they don’t have the same type of capability to bully their neighbors that we saw at the outset of this conflict.”\n\nAustin was also asked about worries that Russia might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, a fear exacerbated by casual threats being made by some Russian politicians and television commentators.\n\n“You heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful,” Austin said. “Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. It’s a war that, you know, all sides lose, and so, rattling of sabres, and, you know, dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful, and something that we won’t engage in.”\n\nThe U.S. defense chief also praised Germany, which announced in Ramstein on Tuesday that it would send heavy weapons, including tanks, to Ukraine.\n\n“Those systems will provide real capability,” he said.\n\nHans von der Burchard contributed to this article.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26/h_57638467-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:36'}

Putin’s military aggression in Ukraine has demonstrated the need for unity within the EU, now more than ever. The path to this unity is through political integration, primarily the implementation of concrete and lasting proposals stemming from the resolutions of the Conference on the Future of Europe (CoFoE).\n\nThe economic collapse of 2008-2009, the Euro crisis of 2010-2012 and the COVID-19 pandemic shall be viewed as hallmarks of the demise of the neoliberal doctrine that for decades arrogantly touted the benefits of financial deregulation, labour market liberalisation, privatisation of state companies and public services, industrial delocalisation, unbalanced free trade and the minimal state.\n\nAs a result, the economic system as a whole has become unsustainable, fragile and prone to shocks. Economic, social and regional inequalities have increased dramatically, and essential public services – particularly healthcare and social welfare systems – came into the pandemic from an already weakened position.\n\nMany of these neoliberal policies were promoted and endorsed by the EU and its member states throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, despite essential instruments of social policy like the European Social Fund, the European Social Chapter, and critical legislative milestones like the Working Time Directive.\n\nThe birth of the Euro in 1992 created both opportunities and challenges. In many cases, it enhanced neoliberal approaches of market-oriented competitiveness, focusing on disinflation, deficit and debt reduction as paramount objectives, based on an unsuccessful EU economic governance framework to the detriment of full employment, social policies and the environment.\n\nTrue to form, the EU led by Merkel and Sarkozy and a right-wing majority in the European institutions responded to the debt crisis of 2010 with extreme austerity policies, thus provoking a second recession, social deprivation and discontent, and the rise of far-right, Eurosceptic, anti-European and anti-immigration political forces.\n\nNevertheless, some EU policies started to change with the expansionary monetary policy of the European Central Bank, and later on with the first Investment Plan for Europe, albeit very limited in scope, and the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPRS), an important declaration but of a non-binding nature. However, other important projects of that era – also extremely relevant today – remain uncompleted, like the banking union endowed with a common deposit guarantee.\n\nThe pandemic has already forced the Union to step away from or even abandon old dogmas in favour of a more flexible and progressive approach, trying to rebalance the market-state equation in favour of the latter. The public debt rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) have been suspended to sustain incomes and jobs. The Health Union has been launched, including the common purchasing of vaccines.\n\nA Recovery Plan for Europe, financed by Eurobonds (the same ones blatantly rejected in 2010), is in place to distribute loans and grants, to be paid back by future EU taxes on financial transactions, CO2 and digital platforms. This is tantamount to an embryo of financial and fiscal union, which we welcome, but this also requires continuity and political-strategic planning for concrete results and full democratic legitimation by enhancing accountability and transparency.\n\nIndeed, CoFoE constitutes a significant opportunity to consolidate the pandemic’s progressive openings. The SGP must be thoroughly reformed and converted into a Sustainability Development and Employment Pact to incorporate social justice, full employment and a green economy as key objectives, adopt new realistic debt and deficit rules, set real and upward social, economic and regional convergence targets, while excluding public investment from debt and deficit calculations.\n\nThe Recovery Plan must be converted into a permanent tool for financing social convergence and the green and digital transitions and as an anti-cyclical fiscal capacity. The ECB should be allowed to provide direct financial assistance to the Union during emergencies like the pandemic. The EPSR should be incorporated into the Treaty with the same binding force of the four market freedoms and the climate neutrality goals.\n\nIt is also high time for a reformed and humane migration policy that fully respects human rights and our founding values, based on the shared responsibility of the member states. Europe, facing demographic decline and rural depopulation, can only benefit from the well-managed and orderly arrival of migrants and must at the same time show solidarity with people fleeing tyranny and war. During this crisis provoked by Putin’s aggression, our Union should deliver guarantee peace and safety for all through the implementation of common efforts and initiatives.\n\nIn the long decade between two crises – the financial crash and the COVID-19 pandemic – the EU has been frozen with a de facto overconcentration of powers in the Council, to the detriment of the Parliament, the only institution directly elected by the citizens. At the same time, the Commission’s role as the guardian of the Treaties is fading away, sliding closer to Council’s positions. This strong intergovernmental bias against the Community method has not only widened the “democratic deficit” of the Union, but also constrained advances in social policy, among others, due to unanimity requirements. The nascent financial and fiscal union only deepens this democratic dilemma.\n\nTherefore, the Parliament should be empowered to co-decide on EU debt and taxation with the Council, with the right to initiate legislation. The Council should become a true Chamber of States, making decisions with a qualified majority. The EU should show zero tolerance when the rule of law is not respected. Lastly, a pan-European electoral constituency should be established to generate a transnational debate and campaign, make European political parties visible and more powerful, and strengthen the lead candidate system for the election of the President of the Commission.\n\nWe commit ourselves to strive towards these policy and institutional objectives at CoFoE, an innovative forum with the participation of social partners, organised civil society, and randomly selected citizens. We firmly believe that this occasion can pave the way for a more united and progressive Europe, equitably providing the much-needed transnational public goods that citizens need and expect from the Union.\n\nEurope must be capable of establishing itself as a virtuous model in the eyes of its member states and the whole world, as a champion and defender of the values of democracy and peace on which our Union was built.', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/pap-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:42'}

Let\'s understand the real needs of Ukraine and informed as a coalition to unite around, important for them, specific needs that we can all stand behind," he called for, again.\n\nAnd he argued why it is not dangerous for us to send aid - none of the EU countries that sent it went to war with Russia.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/ClubZ', 'image': 'https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-04/photo_verybig_214859.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:27'}

Tomorrow we’ll start working hard.”\n\nFor Janša, who took office in 2018, the result almost certainly ends a colourful and often controversial political career.\n\nJanša last year survived an impeachment motion filed by four opposition parties, accusing him of mismanaging the Covid-19 pandemic, failing to order enough vaccines, and attacking the media, most notably the state-funded news agency STA.\n\nIn February 2021, the Slovenian government’s communication office suspended payments to STA, which many in the country viewed as an attack on the editorial independence of the agency.\n\nIn its latest Freedom in the World report, Freedom House, an organisation that conducts research and advocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights, said that while political rights and civil liberties are generally respected in Slovenia, the Janša government had throughout 2021 continued attempts to undermine the rule of law and democratic institutions, including the media and judiciary, and that corruption remains an issue.\n\nDuring his time in office, Janša earnt himself the nickname “Marshall Twito” for the way in which he made use of the social media platform Twitter to attack opponents and make baseless claims, such as a bizarre post congratulating Donald Trump on his reelection as US president when it was already clear that Trump had been defeated by Joe Biden.\n\nAn increasingly isolated Viktor Orbán\n\nJanša’s loss leaves Hungary’s Viktor Orbán increasingly isolated within the European Union. The pair, both staunch eurosceptics, had been close, with Slovenia’s clampdown on the media often described as “Hungary-like”.\n\nNevertheless, unlike Orbán, who has been reluctant to offer anything except the most perfunctory support for Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia’s invasion, Janša has taken a hardline approach towards Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin – he was one of the first international leaders to visit Kyiv following Moscow’s invasion on February 24.\n\n“The results are what they are,” Janša said after the first results of the election were published, highlighting his government’s work.\n\n“Many challenges lie ahead for the new government, whatever it may look like, but the foundations are solid.”\n\nSlovenia’s economy is expected to grow 3.7 per cent in 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said last week, lowering its forecast for a 4.6 per cent increase made in October. In 2021, the country’s economy expanded by 8.1 per cent.\n\nThe IMF also expects average consumer price inflation of 6.7 per cent in Slovenia in 2022, accelerating from 1.9 per cent last year.\n\nPhoto: Robert Golub posting his electoral ballot.

Then this plan is for you.\n\nHe quickly positioned himself as the main rival to Janša\'s — nicknamed \'mini-Orbán\' over his attacks on press freedom and the rule of law since he entered office in 2020. But his victory was made possible primarily because of Janša\'s unpopularity, political analysts say.\n\nAlthough campaigning on a green ticket, Golob\'s victory "had nothing to do with ecology," political analyst Miha Kovač told EUobserver, and can instead be explained by Janša\'s "talent to get into conflict with a wide variety of people."\n\n"People are angry after two years of Janša\'s effort to destroy the country," fellow political scientist Alem Maksuti said.\n\nIn recent months Janša has battled with EU lawmakers over his attempt to suspend funding to the national news agency and has come under fire in his own country for fining and arresting people who protested against his attacks on freedom of expression. "He fined an organiser €35,000," Kovač said, "which is more than [Russian president Vladimir] Putin has."\n\n"Simply put, Janša\'s government favoured the illiberal path set out by Hungary, and people decided they did not want to live in such a country," Kovač said.\n\nIn recent years, investors connected to Hungarian president Victor Orbán have invested heavily in Slovenian media to create a media environment supportive of Janša, but according to Makusi his control over society is not as strong. "We are not Hungary," he said.\n\nGolob\'s upset was helped by the fact that the political left is fragmented over five smaller parties.\n\n"Many people voted strategically, I think. Golob was seen as the one with the best chance of beating Janša," Kovač said.\n\nThe Freedom Movement won 41 seats in parliament, meaning it only needs one other party — most likely the social democrats — to form a majority government.\n\nBut many of the new positions will be filled by people who are new to politics, one of whom is Dejan Zavec, a former lightweight boxing champion who Kovač describes as "quite articulate" but whose lack of political experience causes uncertainty.\n\n"It is hard to predict how these people will behave in parliament," he said. "If Golob is unable to keep his party together, Janša will try to exploit it."\n\nWhen former prime minister Marjan Šarec was forced to resign in March 2020 in the wake of a dispute over health care legislation, Janša, in a surprise move, managed to gather support for a coalition of right-wing parties and formed a new government via a parliamentary vote.\n\n"I do not expect such problems to arise," Maksuti said. "Janša is a corrupt politician. And they [Golob\'s government] will do anything to present a different reality."', 'image': 'https://media.euobserver.com/69af68f8174a3d071e0d286c67953816-800x.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:43'}

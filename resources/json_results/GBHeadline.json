        "text": "Boris Johnson Urged to Help Free British Fighters Captured in Ukraine\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been urged to help free two British nationals who were captured by Russia when fighting in Mariupol.\n\nThe family of Aiden Aslin told a British TV broadcaster on Monday that they hope Johnson will help and have something \u201csorted out\u201d so the 28-year-old and his fellow Briton, 48-year-old Shaun Pinner, can be returned to their families.\n\nThe UK government said it\u2019s in touch with the two families to support them. It also condemned the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes and called for anyone detained to be treated humanely in accordance with the requirements of international humanitarian law.\n\nAslin, originally from Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, north England, and Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, east England, are both members of the Ukrainian armed forces. The families said they have both been in Ukraine since 2018, long before the Russian invasion of the eastern European country.\n\nThe pair were captured earlier this month after their unit had to surrender after 48 days of defending Mariupol as they were \u201crunning out of ammunition.\u201d\n\nThey later appeared on Russian state TV, asking Johnson to help exchange for them with Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who was arrested by the Ukrainian secret services on April 12. It\u2019s not clear if they were under duress.\n\nBoth appeared to have bruises and Aslin appeared to have been beaten. Their families later said they were in contact with the UK\u2019s Foreign Office to ensure the Russian authorities \u201cmeet their obligations to prisoners of war under international law.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry on April 21 said \u201cthe Russian side [was] taking care of them,\u201d and they were \u201cfed, watered, and given the necessary assistance. Just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained.\u201d\n\nA Russian national flag flies by destroyed buildings in Mariupol, Ukraine, on April 12, 2022.

The International Committee of the Red Cross also recommends not publishing images that identify prisoners of war, or show them in humiliating or degrading situations unless there\u2019s a \u201ccompelling public interest\u201d in doing so in accordance with the Geneva Convention.\n\nBut Aslin\u2019s mother Angela and his brother Nathan spoke to TalkTV on Monday, pleading for Johnson\u2019s help. Pinner\u2019s family also previously released a statement through the FCDO, rebuking Russian media\u2019s characterisation of foreign fighters in the Ukrainian military as \u201cmercenaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope that, at some point, there will be a prisoner swap. However, it\u2019s out of my hands. It is between Ukraine and Russia,\u201d Nathan Aslin told TalkTV.\n\nOutlining his recent phone conversation with his brother, Nathan Aslin told the broadcaster, \u201cIt was obvious that he was with the Russian people that were holding him and he was asking for me to contact Boris [Johnson] to get this prison swap done. And to keep on asking for this swap.\u201d\n\nAsked what he would say to the prime minister, Nathan said: \u201cAct now when you got the time to act. You\u2019ve got two British citizens on the line, being forced to say whatever the Russians are putting in [their] mouths at gunpoint, whether they show it on the camera or not. And it\u2019s a moral obligation to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAngela Aslin added: \u201cI would like to hope that Boris will help. And talk to the Ukraine government [and] embassy. There can be something sorted out so that these two guys can come home.\u201d\n\nAslin moved to Ukraine in 2018 with his Ukrainian fianc\u00e9e and now holds British and Ukrainian citizenship. He previously fought the ISIS terrorist group with Kurdish militia People\u2019s Defense Units in Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nPinner\u2019s family previously said that the former British Army soldier decided to relocate to Ukraine in 2019 \u201cto use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Pinner \u201cenjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country\u201d where he also met his Ukrainian wife.\n\nForeign Office minister James Cleverly on Tuesday confirmed that Aslin and Pinner should be treated as prisoners of war.\n\nAsked about the pair by Aslin\u2019s local MP\u2014former housing minister Robert Jenrick\u2014Cleverly told Parliament he had discussed the issue of foreign volunteer fighters with the Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201cThey are clear, and we are clear, that those fighting under the Ukrainian flag for the Ukrainian armed forces in the defence of Ukraine should be treated as Ukrainian military and as prisoners of war, with all the protections that the international humanitarian law affords to those individuals,\u201d Cleverly said.\n\nThe UK government advises against all travel to Ukraine.",

Here are the highlights of events in Ukraine over the past 24 hours:\n\nFive victims of attacks on railway stations\n\nAt least five people have been killed and 18 injured in Russian missile strikes at five railway stations in central Ukraine's Vinnytsia region, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office said.\n\nThe US wants a \"weakened\" Russia\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hopes the war in Ukraine will make it difficult for the Russian military. \"We want to see Russia weakened to the point that it cannot do the things it did during the invasion of Ukraine,\" he said after a visit to Kyiv with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Ukraine can win the war if it has the \"right equipment\", he added.\n\nAustin and Blinken pledged 0 million in additional military aid during their visit.\n\nRussia warns of real danger from World War III\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has warned that there is a \"real\" danger of an outbreak of World War III as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. \"The danger is serious, it's real, you can't underestimate it,\" he told Interfax.\n\nPeace talks to continue\n\nPeace talks with Ukraine will continue, Lavrov added. He criticized Kyiv's approach to the talks and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of \"pretending\" to negotiate. \"Goodwill has its limits. But if it is not reciprocal, it does not help the negotiation process,\" he said.\n\nUS ambassadors and consuls will return to Kyiv\n\nBlinken confirmed that US diplomats withdrawn from Ukraine at the start of the Russian invasion would gradually return to Kyiv.

        "text": "Elon Musk has sealed a deal to acquire Twitter for $44 billion US.\n\nThe move comes after the richest man in the world started buying shares in the company in March, complaining that the social media network wasn't doing enough to ensure free speech.\n\nThe company rebuffed his advances for weeks before the two sides struck a deal over the weekend that was made official on Monday.\n\nThe purchase price of $54.20 a share is a 38 per cent premium to what the shares were worth before Musk's stake became public.\n\n\"The Twitter board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing,\" Twitter chairman Bret Taylor said.\n\n\"The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.\"\n\nAt $44 billion US, the deal will be one of the largest leveraged buyouts in corporate history. More than $25 billion US of the purchase price will be financed with debt. Presuming that shareholders vote to accept the proposal, the deal also faces numerous regulatory hurdles.\n\nTwo Canadian banks \u2014 the Royal Bank of Canada and CIBC \u2014 were among a consortium of a dozen lenders who agreed to help Musk finance his bid, with Royal agreeing to lend Musk $750 million, and CIBC $400 million, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nMusk reiterated that it was his desire to ensure free speech that compelled him to take over the company.\n\n\"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" Musk said Monday, adding that he wants to make the company's algorithm open source \u2014 that is, publicly accessible \u2014 to increase trust.\n\n\"Twitter has tremendous potential,\" he said. \"I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\"\n\nWATCH | Mixed reactions to Twitter deal: Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter met with mixed reaction Duration 0:33 These residents of New York City were split on whether they approved or disapproved of Elon Musk becoming the owner of Twitter. 0:33\n\nRyan Holmes, founder of Vancouver-based tech company Hootsuite, says the move to open up the company's algorithm has huge potential.\n\nEffectively, the algorithm is a program that sorts content for the user and decides what content they should see, and Holmes says he's been \"really bullish\" on making it open source, which could be a \"really powerful thing\" for Twitter.\n\nHe said the problem with closed algorithms is that nobody knows why they're seeing the content they do, but with open source, \"people are able to go in and look at it, to audit it, to understand what's getting served up and for what reasons.\"\n\nHolmes said opening it up would create \"a lot of transparency\" and \"in Twitter doing this, it would force the hands of the other social networks.\"\n\nThe agreement is the latest twist in the fast-moving saga, which began under a month ago when Musk disclosed in a regulatory filing than he had quietly amassed 73 million shares in the company \u2014 more than any other single entity.\n\nWATCH | Analyst explains why Musk would want to buy Twitter:\n\nTwitter stockholders would get 'dream' price with Musk bid, says analyst Duration 0:54 Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says he sees big changes ahead for Twitter if Elon Musk is successful in his pricey bid for the social media company. 0:54\n\nAfter initially inviting him to join the board, the company eventually changed direction and set into motion a \"poison pill\" plan designed to make the company harder to take over.\n\nThe two sides came together to hammer out a deal over the weekend after Musk announced he had secured more than $46 billion for a takeover plan.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who covers Twitter, says while he expected the move, the price tag still came as a bit of a surprise.\n\n\"Taking private is going to have a lot of change for Twitter, but Musk just bet 20 per cent of his net worth on Twitter,\" Ives said. \"It's not just about freedom of speech.\"\n\nI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means \u2014@elonmusk\n\nKate Klonick, a professor of law at St. John's University in New York, said the news shines a light on just how much influence these massive social media giants have in our modern life.\n\n\"This is exposing a lot of the problems that have long been there and that we've been trying to grapple with for a long time,\" she said in an interview. \"This is just a very dramatic kind of introduction of how quickly something like this can can change hands in terms of private enterprise.\"\n\nTechnology analyst Amber Mac says she has been an avid user of the service for several years, and has some concerns about what Musk's control of the company could mean.\n\n\"Elon Musk is someone who is always talking about free speech in an absolute way, and I think that causes some potential concerns for people on the platform who are often already victims of bullying and harassment,\" she told CBC News.\n\n\"If we see this platform go in a direction where there are no guardrails in place, I think this could mean a huge number of people potentially leaving.\"",

(Phhoto: Xinhua)\n\nAn indigenous leader on Monday pressed for UN investigations into alleged genocide by the Canadian government in \"residential schools\" for indigenous children.\"The Canadian government established what I call 'institutions of assimilation and genocide.' These institutions were designed to kill the Indian and the child by forbidding them to speak their language, which disconnect them from their families and communities,\" said RoseAnne Archibald, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, an organization for indigenous rights in Canada.\"Some people refer to these institutions as 'residential schools.' I don't call them schools anymore because no school I ever attended had children buried in unmarked graves.Thousands and thousands of our children died in these institutions,\" she told reporters at UN Headquarters in New York after attending a session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.\"I'm calling on the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, along with other special rapporteurs, to conduct full-fledged investigations of the circumstances and responsibilities surrounding these institutions, including full redress, criminal prosecutions and sanctions and other remedies for human rights violations, including genocide.\"\"Canada must not be allowed to investigate itself. Please help us ensure that something like this never happens again, not just to us, but to anyone.\"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is the federal police organization, would come into Indian communities and take children forcibly and they would threaten parents with arrest. How can that organization investigate itself or investigate Canada? It can't, she said.\"Canada's government established those institutions through policies and legislation. How can they possibly be independent and impartial when it shows that they are culpable and guilty of the deaths of our children?\"She said her assembly has written to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and made a formal request for investigations, but has not heard back yet.A number of lawyers went to the International Criminal Court in 2021 to ask for investigations into the possible gross human rights violations with respect to those institutions.The lawyers were turned away, she said.\"I believe that we're gonna continue to press on the ICC to also look at this situation in Canada with respect to our children, who went to those institutions and those children who died in those institutions especially.\"Xinhua",

        "text": "I just about spit up my morning coffee (Sumatran by the way), on my MacBook keyboard.\n\nAn official comment that was so ridiculous I had to catch my breath and suppress my rage.\n\nThe existential vomit that was brewing in me. Take five, Dave, take five.\n\nI have tons of emails and stories to look over every morning. I have the time to do this because I\u2019m semi-retired.\n\nIt\u2019s part of my job now, as a columnist with several websites, including the Western Standard.\n\nIt\u2019s a great privilege and I enjoy it.\n\nBut this one really took the cake.\n\nIt was a story that ran in The Defense Post, as follows:\n\nThe Canadian military is acquiring three spy planes under a US foreign military sales agreement to boost its aerial surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\n\nWith a combined price tag of $247 million, Canada\u2019s new 350ER King Air spy planes will be fitted with cutting-edge surveillance gear such as MX-15D targeting equipment.\n\nThe gear features a powerful camera similar to those used in Ukraine to follow Russian troop movements and target airstrikes.\n\nOnce in service, the 350ER King Air aircraft will be used by the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command for missions \u201cat home and abroad.\u201d\n\nOK, that was the news, but check out this follow-up statement \u2026\n\nFor retired Canadian lieutenant-colonel Steve Day, the spy plane can not only be used in international military missions but also to address domestic terrorist threats.\n\nHe described the 350ER King Air aircraft as a \u201cvery sophisticated platform\u201d due to its state-of-the-art sensors and warning systems.\n\n350ER King Air aircraft\n\nFolks \u2026 let\u2019s have a closer look at this.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze it and see what this really means for you and me. These are your tax dollars and you deserve to know what is going on here.\n\nIt\u2019s clear these aircraft are state of the art. No question about that.\n\nAccording to The Defense Post, developed by Textron Aviation\u2019s Beechcraft, the 350ER King Air has reportedly become a \u201cpopular basis\u201d for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance.\n\nIt can fly up to 2,311 nautical miles (4,279 kilometers/2,659 miles) and carry up to 10 personnel, including two crew, the report said. Its maximum speed is 303 knots (561 km/h-348 mph).\n\nOfficially, the sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by helping to improve the military capability of Canada.\n\nThat is a cool toy, right? A very cool toy.\n\nWill it be used by CSIS, Counter Narcotics (RCMP) or the military? They say Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, but what the hell does that mean?\n\nFurther, who in God\u2019s name will it be used against?\n\nIf it was to be used internationally \u2014 against the Islamic State in northern Iraq or in Syria \u2014 the aircraft would have to be ferried to its location. Does that sound practical to you?\n\nInstead, why wouldn\u2019t we buy ARTEMIS (the Airborne Reconnaissance and Target Exploitation Multi-Mission System) in the Bombardier Challenger 650, currently being used by the US Army over Eastern Europe?\n\nNo, these King Airs aren\u2019t going anywhere, so to speak. They will be used in Canada. And it doesn\u2019t take a college grad to figure that out.\n\nWe know they won\u2019t be used in the Arctic against the Russians.\n\nCanada is looking at buying P-8A Poseidon long-range maritime aircraft from Boeing to replace its aging fleet of CP-140 Auroras, as part of the never-ending Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project.\n\nA replacement program that should have happened years ago.\n\nNo \u2026 my fear, my great fear, is they will be used against us. That\u2019s right, us.\n\nThose evil \u201cNazi\u201d truckers and Bouncy Castle revolutionaries \u2014 people who have different ideas that they don\u2019t like, people they fear.\n\nThe Fred and Marthas who donated to the Freedom Convoy, who were vilified by a cowardly prime minister who ran and hid.\n\nPeople like me, who write the truth. People who don\u2019t shovel their driveways or people who like Sean Penn. Take your pick.\n\nGod forbid they use it against eco-terrorists in northern BC. No, that would make sense.\n\nAccording to my intel sources, because we have so very few internal threats (other than Iraqi and Russian embassy staff under 24/7 surveillance), they will have to pull old security files.\n\nKeep in mind that one in four Canadians has an RCMP file.\n\nYou thought you had freedom? Say goodnight, Virginia. The new era has arrived, and \u201cwe\u201d are the enemy.\n\nClearly, they will have to dig deep, very deep to find new threats \u2014 even if they have to invent them to keep those shiny twin-engine beauties flying.\n\nYour basic, \u201cRound up the usual suspects,\u201d so they can justify this expense.\n\nJust imagine, folks, everything you ever texted on your cellphone or said on social media, every inch of metadata, is being tracked and monitored by the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canada\u2019s other spy agency.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but this spy plane deal is a joke. This is a waste of money.\n\nWhy?\n\nSimple. Ask any eight-year old, who asks his mom and dad to buy them a Chinese-made DJI drone at Amazon.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that drones are far cheaper, more effective and easier to deploy anywhere in the world.\n\nInterestingly, they could be fully operated and controlled from Spec Ops Command in Petawawa, Ont.\n\nAs we speak, drones are re-writing the rules of war over Ukraine and kicking Russian ass. They are a proven commodity.\n\nThe other thing the RCMP Air Service has employed its spy planes over Canadian cities for decades, one of which was LCT (Lima Charlie Tango).\n\nFor entertainment, I used to tune in on my Sony air radio to hear them talk with Air Traffic Control \u2014 it was laughable. Literally anyone, any bad guy in southern Alberta, could hear everything they said.\n\nCities like Calgary also have the HAWCS helicopter for surveillance and watch-list harassment.\n\nSo why in God\u2019s name are we buying these things? Why are we buying a howitzer to kill a mosquito?\n\nIs it because allies like Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and the US have them and we have to keep up with the neighbourhood?\n\nThat\u2019s probably a big part of it, I would think \u2014 the potential for near-real-time data transfer and interoperability with allies. \u202a\n\nBe there or be square, as they say.\n\nThe other part: I think it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a big new intelligence push happening in Canada. It\u2019s a scary world out there and it\u2019s getting scarier.\n\nCall it the Putin factor, the ISIS factor, the Trucker factor \u2026 whatever.\n\nBut it\u2019s happening and you, my friends, are going to pay for it with your tax dollars whether you like it or not.\n\nThe cost in freedom is yet to be determined.\n\nDave Makichuk is a Western Standard contributor.\n\nPTacitus27@gmail.com",

The Department of Homeland Security estimates that there could be upward of 18,000 encounters per day if Title 42 is repealed on May 23. The policy was put in place during former President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nRepublicans are highlighting the nationwide impact of unchecked illegal immigration in response to what they see as President Joe Biden's lack of action on a crucial issue ahead of the midterm elections. The issues highlighted include increased distribution of fentanyl throughout the United States, the sexual exploitation of women and minors at the hands of the cartels that control human smuggling across the border, and national security threats.\n\nREPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHAT IS TITLE 42 AND HOW WILL ITS END AFFECT THE SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS?\n\n\"I watched a man who was probably 6' 5,\" was a rancher who has lived here his whole life, 20 miles from the border, break down in tears to talk about the situation,\" McCarthy said during a press conference in the border town of Eagle Pass, Texas. \"He told us he and his wife can't leave the lights on to their house at night because people will come; his fear is that people are going to get killed. That's what's happening right now. This is a responsibility of the federal government.\"\n\nMcCarthy, in line to become speaker if Republicans win a majority in the midterm elections, said that some House Democrats need to step up to keep Title 42 in place. But the delegation noted that it is only a temporary measure for the vast reforms needed.\n\n\n\n\"Title 42 is a Band-Aid on a gunshot wound,\" said Rep. Chip Roy of Texas. \"It's not actual border security. It's important, but it represents the ability to turn people away and actually secure the border. But we've got to actually do the hard work of having a sovereign nation with a secure border so that migrants don't get killed.\"\n\nHouse Republicans Elise Stefanik and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia were included in the delegation.

        "text": "MONTREAL -- While remaining unvaccinated against COVID-19 is often framed as a personal choice, those who spurn the vaccines raise the risk of infection for those around them, a new study suggests.\n\nThe research published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that vaccinated people who mix with those who are not vaccinated have a significantly greater chance of being infected than those who stick with people who have received the shot.\n\nIn contrast, unvaccinated people's risk of contracting COVID-19 drops when they spend time with people who are vaccinated, because they serve as a buffer to transmission, according to the mathematical model used in the study.\n\nCo-author David Fisman, of the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana school of public health, said the message of the study is that the choice to get vaccinated can't be thought of as merely personal.\n\n\"You may like to drive your car 200 kilometres an hour and think that's fun, but we don\u2019t allow you to do that on a highway partly because you can kill and injure yourself, but also because you're creating risk for those around you,\" he said in a recent interview.\n\nFisman said the idea for study came a few months ago amid the debate around vaccine passports and vaccine mandates.\n\n\"We thought what was missing from that conversation was, what are the rights of vaccinated people to be protected from unvaccinated people?\" he said.\n\nThe conclusion, he said, is that \"public health is something you actually have to do collectively.\"\n\n\"What we kind of concluded is that the decision to not be vaccinated \u2014 you can't really regard it as a self-regarding risk (because) you're creating risk for other people around you by interacting with them,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers used a mathematical model to estimate how many infections would occur in a population, depending on how much mixing occurred between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. It found that when people mixed with people of a similar vaccination status, infection rates among vaccinated people decreased from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, and they increased from 62 per cent to 79 per cent among those who were not vaccinated.\n\nFisman said that in real life, people tend to spend the most time with people who are similar to them. So, he said, even if vaccinated people are most likely to spend time with others who have received shots, they're disproportionately impacted when they spend time with those who haven't.\n\nHe said the arrival of more contagious COVID-19 variants, such as Omicron, have impacted both vaccine effectiveness and public faith in vaccination. But he said that even when vaccine efficacy was lowered to 40 per cent in the model and the reproductive rate was increased to account for a more contagious variant the overall conclusions were the same.\n\nHe said the study actually underplays the importance of vaccines in one way because it doesn't take into account how they vastly cut the chances of death and hospitalization.\n\nFisman said the results, from a purely \"utilitarian\" perspective, provide justification for the implementation of public health measures such as vaccine passports and vaccine mandates.\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that a simple mathematical model doesn't fully reflect the real world or the diverse factors that must be taken into account when setting public health policy, including political considerations and public anger.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2022.\n\n___\n\nWhat questions do you have about Omicron?\n\nWith the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant of concern, labelled Omicron, CTVNews.ca wants to hear from Canadians with any questions.\n\nTell us what you\u2019d like to know when it comes to the Omicron COVID-19 variant.\n\nTo submit your question, email us at dotcom@bellmedia.ca with your name, location and question.

        "text": "Well, in the end, it seemed relatively easy.\n\nAn impressive 58.5 per cent. Not quite the crushing two-thirds of the vote Emmanuel Macron won five years ago. But almost every other winner of the French presidency would have been very happy with his score.\n\n\"Is he lucky?\"\n\nThat was the question Cardinal Mazarin always asked about prospective ministers. The cardinal was the right-hand man \u2014 the prime minister in all but name \u2014 of Louis XIV for almost two decades in the 1600s. Mazarin was apparently deeply superstitious, and only wanted \"lucky\" lieutenants.\n\nIn Macron's case, the answer has to be \"yes.\"\n\nThe French president came to office five years ago promising to push through major change. Instead, major change pushed him and his government around.\n\nThere was a leaderless uprising in the smaller towns and countryside of France called \"les gilets jaunes,\" or Yellow Vests, who resisted an \"environmental\" tax on diesel fuel that they claimed would drive poorer drivers into debt. (The tax was dropped.) Then, the devastation of COVID-19. Meanwhile, the eight-year French military expedition in several countries of sub-Saharan Africa, sent to wipe out ISIS groups, has largely failed. The French forces are pulling back and the extremists hold even more territory.\n\nBut Macron could rely on his luck.\n\nThe Yellow Vests exhausted themselves and the country three years ago \u2014 although it took months, not weeks as in Canada with the recent truckers' protests.\n\nAfter a stuttering initial response to COVID-19, Macron's push to vaccinate the population earned grudging support from the majority of voters.\n\nAnd the African debacle has been completely overshadowed by war in Ukraine.\n\nA splintered opposition\n\nFrench presidential elections are run in two rounds. The first round is wide open; the second, two weeks later, is a runoff between the two candidates with the most votes in the first round.\n\nMacron's biggest luck lay in the lineup of opponents against him for the presidency this time around. There were no fewer than 11 candidates in the first round, splintering the opposition vote.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the French presidential candidate for the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party, salutes supporters after a speech at the Pavillon d'Armenonville in Paris on April 24. She ended up getting 41.5 per cent of the vote. (Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFurther luck: far-right leader Marine Le Pen found herself battling for votes with Eric Zemmour, a man with even more pronounced extremist views. On Jan. 16, in the midst of the campaign, Zemmour was fined almost $15,000 by a Paris court for inciting racial hatred. He had said on television in 2020 that unaccompanied child migrants in France are \"thieves,\" \"rapists\" and \"murderers.\"\n\nZemmour called the court's decision \"ideological and stupid.\" But he faded and Le Pen came second in the first round, almost five per cent behind Macron.\n\nLe Pen was running for president for a third time, the second time against Macron, the man she and many voters denounced as arrogant.\n\nThe incumbent president didn't so much defend his record as attack Le Pen's program. Macron said she was anti-Europe, anti-immigrant and beholden to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the candidates' debate on April 20, Macron referred to a nine million euro ($14 million Cdn) loan her party obtained from a Kremlin-linked bank in 2014.\n\n\"When you talk to Russia,\" Macron said to her, \"you are not talking to its leaders; you are talking to your banker.\"\n\n'A victory of relief'\n\nThis was a killer line. Le Pen had been loud in her praise of Putin right up to his brutal invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.\n\nLe Pen also managed to fumble her strongest argument, the sharply rising cost of living. Macron pointed out that he had capped energy prices and was sending special cost-of-living cheques to the poorest voters while Le Pen proposed cutting the value added tax (VAT) across the board, which Macron said would benefit \"people like you and me,\" who didn't need help nearly as much.\n\nAnd so he won. Macron is the first French president to be re-elected in 20 years, but commentators like Brice Teinturier, of the polling institute Ipsos, called it \"more a victory of relief. Hope seems quite absent from the result of this election.\"\n\nEven Macron seemed pensive in his victory speech. \"I know that many people voted for me not in support of my ideas, but to block the extreme right.\"\n\nThese defaced campaign posters for Macron and Le Pen in southwestern France demonstrate the broader discontent with the choice of candidates in the runoff in the 2022 presidential election. (Bob Edme/The Associated Press)\n\nHis speech was short and sober. The election-night party under the Eiffel Tower was over by 10 p.m. European leaders rushed to show their relief and congratulate the president. Macron's ministers told interviewers that the Macron II government would be much more open and voter-friendly.\n\nThere is a whiff of worry in the air.\n\nMacron and his custom-built party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche (Republic on the Move), now face parliamentary elections in June. The battle will be uphill.\n\nLingering divisions\n\nAs Teinturier and other analysts underline, the far-right candidates gathered almost one-third of the votes in the first round. Add to that votes for far-left candidates and you have almost 58 per cent of the electorate. The candidates for the traditional centre-right Republicans and centre-left Socialists won, together, less than seven per cent.\n\nAlready the parties on the far left are holding coalition talks and the third-place finisher in the first round, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon (who almost squeaked past Le Pen in a last-minute surge), sees himself as the leader of a majority and a prime minister-in-waiting.\n\nJean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the leftist party La France Insoumise (Unbowed France), seen here in 2017, could become prime minister after legislative elections in June. (Reuters / Alain Jocard)\n\nThis has happened twice in recent history. The French call it \"cohabitation,\" and when the opposition has a legislative majority and forms a government, the president finds himself all but politically naked, stripped of most economic powers.\n\nThe good news for Macron is that Le Pen and Zemmour are still fighting on the far right and won't form a coalition. The bad news is that his own party is seen as little more than yes men and women.\n\nMore bad news: the election analyst J\u00e9rome Fourquet said the election results showed the deep geographical and economic split in the country. In the first round, Le Pen won less than six per cent of the votes in the capital, Paris, while racking up big first-place scores in poorer areas in the north and south.\n\n\"The presidential campaign was fleeting and lacked substance,\" Fourquet said in an interview with the newspaper Le Figaro. \"It offered no safety valve or cathartic purge of the tension running through the country. The fear is that all this will move from parliament and spill into the streets.\"\n\nMacron could be wondering if his luck is about to run out.",

School closures, lack of access to maternal and newborn health care and a decline in immunizations of other preventable diseases has led to a re-emergence of measles and polio, she added. \"Children are a kind of hidden victims of the pandemic,\" she said. New #variants will fuel COVID pandemic unless global vaccine rate rises: #Gavi, #UNICEF. #Covid19 #CDNPoli Caprani and Berkley told the committee that the problem of vaccine supply \u2014 which led to widespread criticism last year that Canada and other countries were vaccine hoarders \u2014 is no longer the prevailing problem. There are now plenty of manufactured vaccine doses available, but less-developed countries lack the capacity to actually get people vaccinated. They cited a range of factors from damaged or inadequate health-care systems to vaccine hesitancy, to a lack of health-care workers and basic supplies, such as syringes, to inject vaccines into willing arms. International Development Minister Harjit Sajjan noted the capacity shortcomings on a recent trip to western Africa and said he planned to look for ways to target Canada's aid spending to areas where it could be most useful.\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada was increasing its contribution to COVAX, the international vaccine sharing alliance that Gavi is leading, to $700 million to help purchase, deliver and distribute COVID-19 vaccines to lower-income countries. NDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson told the committee she did not want to see rich countries cut back on their overall international development spending as they roll out fourth doses for their own populations. \"There's this sort of feeling that COVID-19 is over, that we can change the channel that we can turn the page. And I think both our witnesses today have made it very, very clear that we are not out of this pandemic.\"",

I am hopeful that Elon Musk will help rein in Big Tech\u2019s history of censoring users that have a different viewpoint. \u2014@MarshaBlackburn\n\nWhile some American Conservatives cheered the prospect of fewer controls, human rights activists voiced fears of a rise in hate speech.\n\nDeborah Brown, a digital rights researcher and advocate at Human Rights Watch, said that regardless of who owns Twitter, the company has the responsibility to respect the human rights of people around the world, who rely on the platform.\n\n\"Changes to its policies, features and algorithms, big and small, can have disproportionate and sometimes devastating impacts, including offline violence,\" Brown told Reuters in an email.\n\n\"Freedom of expression is not an absolute right, which is why Twitter needs to invest in efforts to keep its most vulnerable users safe on the platform.\"\n\nMusk's Twitter account is seen on a smartphone in front of the Twitter logo. Musk, whose Twitter following tops 84 million, has been an outspoken critic of the company's moderation polices. (Dado Ruvic/Reuters)\n\nAmnesty International also weighed in, saying it was concerned about the potential for Twitter to make decisions that could erode enforcement mechanisms designed to moderate hate speech.\n\n\"The last thing we need is a Twitter that willfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons and others,\" said Michael Kleinman, director of technology and human rights at Amnesty International USA.\n\nFormer Twitter CEO supportive\n\nMusk wants Twitter's algorithm for prioritizing tweets to be public and said he objects to giving too much power on the service to corporations that advertise. He has also advocated user-friendly tweaks to the service, such as an edit button and defeating \"spam bots\" that send overwhelming amounts of unwanted tweets.\n\nIn principle, I don\u2019t believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness. \u2014@jack\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey weighed in on the deal late on Monday with a series of tweets that thanked both Musk and current Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal for \"getting the company out of an impossible situation.\"\n\n\"Twitter as a company has always been my sole issue and my biggest regret. It has been owned by Wall Street and the ad model. Taking it back from Wall Street is the correct first step,\" he said.\n\nMusk says it's not about the money\n\nMusk, who is worth $268 billion, according to Forbes, has said he is not primarily concerned with the economics of Twitter.\n\n\"Having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. I don't care about the economics at all,\" he said in a recent public talk.\n\nThe Twitter transaction was approved by the company's board and is now subject to a shareholder vote. No regulatory hurdles are expected, analysts said.\n\nAlthough it is only about a 10th of the size of far larger social media platforms like Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook, Twitter has been credited with helping spawn the Arab Spring uprising, and accused of playing a role in the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol.",

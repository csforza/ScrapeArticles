The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials.

(AP Photo/Felipe Dana) (Felipe Dana)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine — (AP) — Russia unleashed a string of attacks Monday against rail and fuel installations deep inside Ukraine, far from the front lines of Moscow’s new eastern offensive, as Russia’s top diplomat warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.”\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, moved to rush more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from the Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n“Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared, a day after he and the U.S. secretary of defense made a bold visit to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nBlinken said Washington approved a $165 million sale of ammunition — non-U.S. ammo, mainly if not entirely for Ukraine\'s Soviet-era weapons — and will also provide more than $300 million in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin took his comments further, saying that while the U.S. wants to see Ukraine remain a sovereign, democratic country, it also wants "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nAustin’s comments about weakening Russia appeared to represent a shift in broader U.S. strategic goals. Previously, the U.S. position had been that the goal of American military aid was to help Ukraine win and to defend Ukraine’s NATO neighbors against Russian threats.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said weapons supplied by Western countries “will be a legitimate target," adding that Russian forces had already targeted weapons warehouses in western Ukraine.\n\n“Everyone is reciting incantations that in no case can we allow World War III,” Lavrov said in a wide-ranging interview on Russian television. He accused Ukrainian leaders of provoking Russia by asking NATO to become involved in the conflict.\n\nBy providing weapons, NATO forces are “pouring oil on the fire,” he said, according to a transcript on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website.\n\nRegarding the possibility of a nuclear confrontation, Lavrov said: “I would not want to see these risks artificially inflated now, when the risks are rather significant.”\n\n“The danger is serious," he said. "It is real. It should not be underestimated.”\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv, the capital. But the Ukrainians, with the help of Western weapons, thwarted the push and forced President Vladimir Putin\'s troops to retreat.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is to take the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking industrial region in eastern Ukraine. While both sides say the campaign in the east is underway, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and warplanes striking far behind the front lines in an effort to thwart Ukrainian efforts to marshal supplies for the fight.\n\nFive railroad stations in central and western Ukraine were hit, and one worker was killed, said Oleksandr Kamyshin, head of Ukraine\'s state railway. The bombardment included a missile attack near Lviv, the western city close to the Polish border that has been swelled by Ukrainians fleeing the fighting elsewhere around the country.\n\nUkrainian authorities said at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk, in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. general who was NATO’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said the latest strikes against fuel depots are part of a strategy to deplete key Ukrainian war resources. The strikes against rail targets, on the other hand, are a newer tactic, he said.\n\n“I think they’re doing it for the legitimate reason of trying to interdict the flow of supplies to the front,” he said. “The illegitimate reason is they know people are trying to leave the country, and this is just another intimidation, terrorist tactic to make them not have faith and confidence in traveling on the rails.”\n\nPhillips P. O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nIn Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova that sits along the Ukrainian border, several explosions believed caused by rocket-propelled grenades hit the territory\'s Ministry of State Security. There was no immediate claim of responsibility or reports of injuries. Transnistria is a strip of land with about 470,000 people and about 1,500 Russian troops based there.\n\nMoldova\'s Foreign Ministry said “the aim of today’s incident is to create pretexts for straining the security situation in the Transnistrian region." The U.S. warned previously that Russia may launch “false-flag” attacks against its own side to create a pretext for invading other nations.\n\nLast week, Rustam Minnekayev, a Russian military commander, said the Kremlin wants full control of southern Ukraine, which he said would open the way to Transnistria.\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic southern port city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas. Over the weekend, Russian forces launched new airstrikes on the Azovstal plant to try to dislodge the holdouts.\n\nSome 1,000 civilians were also said to be taking shelter at the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor Monday for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with skepticism by Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nThe city council and mayor of Mariupol said a new mass grave has been identified about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities were trying to estimate the number of victims. It was at least the third new mass grave discovered in Russian-controlled areas near Mariupol in the last week.\n\nMariupol has been gutted by bombardment and fierce street fighting over the past two months. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, the capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said his country\'s goal is to maintain resistance and “make the occupiers’ stay in our land even more intolerable,” while Russia drains its resources.\n\nA top Ukrainian official cast doubt on the prospect of further talks between the two countries. Recent sessions in Istanbul ended without resolution earlier this month.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview that any negotiations other than talks between Zelenskyy and Putin would bring little resolution.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective."\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Yuras Karmanau and Jon Gambrell in Lviv, Ukraine, and AP staff around the world contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\'s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

He also urged Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians trapped in the steel mill.\n\nPutin responded by claiming that the Russian forces had offered humanitarian corridors but said the Ukrainian defenders of the plant were using civilians as shields and not allowing them to leave.\n\nBefore meeting the Russian president, Guterres had earlier talked with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and told him he was concerned about reports of possible war crimes in Ukraine and that independent investigations are needed.\n\nHe also said that the United Nations was ready to fully mobilize the world body\'s resources to save lives and evacuate people from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\n\n\nThe sprawling steel complex at Azovstal has remained the last bulwark of Ukrainian resistance the strategic port on the Sea of Azov .\n\nUkrainian officials have said that up to 1,000 civilians have sheltered in the maze of underground tunnels there.

Kyiv won 3-2 in a charity match played in front of about 35,000 fans. All proceeds will go to victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n"It is about sending a signal, a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, earning a bit of money so that we can do one or the other humanitarian action. And then it is also a sign against this despicable war of aggression," Dortmund managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke told broadcasters ZDF.\n\nKyiv has played similar fund-raising matches in Warsaw, Istanbul and Cluj.\n\nPutin claims he hopes for diplomatic agreement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Moscow. In televised remarks, he told Guterres that he still hoped for negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject [talks]," Putin told Guterres, who was visiting Moscow.\n\nHe said talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv. He claimed without evidence, that the massacres in Bucha were not carried out by Russians.\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nGuterres reiterated his call for Ukraine and Russia to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe broadcast discussions showed Guterres and Putin sitting opposite each other at the large oval table in the hall of the Senate Palace, following an hour-long meeting in the Kremlin. Guterres earlier met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov where he called for a ceasefire.\n\nItaly considers nationalizing Lukoil-owned refinery\n\nItaly is reportedly considering temporarily nationalizing a refinery owned by Lukoil — a Russian multinational energy corporation — as a response to possible sanctions on Russian oil.\n\nLukoil, which is not the subject of sanctions, owns the ISAB refinery — Italy\'s largest oil refinery by capacity. It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense. Speaking at the event, Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense, told reporters that "we have to move at the speed of war."\n\nAustin said the US was determined to make better use of the US European Command\'s coordination mechanism and would extend the forum for Ukraine\'s defense into a monthly contact group.\n\n"We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and make it less able to do that," Austin said.\n\nAustin went on to express sharp criticism of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who warned on Monday that World War III might be looming.\n\n"You\'ve heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful," Austin said. "Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence. The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing. Mantoo added that Syria has the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled the country.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nUN doubles Ukraine aid appeal to $2.25 billion\n\nThe United Nations\' humanitarian agency (UN OCHA) said that it has been forced to double its aid appeal to $2.25 billion (€2.11 billion) as the humanitarian situation in the country worsens.\n\n"Over $2.25 billion is now required for needs inside Ukraine, more than double of the amount requested ($1.1 billion) when we launched the appeal on 1 March, a few days after the war began," the UN OCHA said in a statement.\n\nUS, allies will \'move heaven and Earth\' to meet Ukrainian security requirements — Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the aim of the conference at the air base in Ramstein, Germany was to "help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion," as well as to "build up Ukraine\'s defenses for tomorrow\'s challenges."\n\nAustin said that he discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Kyiv\'s "changing requirements" as Russia focuses on Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region. Austin said that the US and its allies will "keep moving heaven and Earth" to meet Ukraine\'s security requirements.\n\n"Ukraine needs our help to win today, and they will still need our help when the war is over," Austin said. He added that the US and its allies have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine\'s defense since the start of the war.\n\nThe defense secretary said that Ukraine "has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia\'s unprovoked invasion."\n\nAustin said that Ukraine\'s allies had provided assistance at "record speed," adding that "Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly."\n\nReferring to Russian troop withdrawal from areas around Ukraine\'s capital, Austin said that the war was "entering a new phase" following what he called "Russia\'s defeat at the battle of Kyiv."\n\n"Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man," Austin said, alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens."\n\nWatch video 01:06 Austin: \'We\'re here to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion\'\n\nExplosions hit radio facility in Russia-backed Trans-Dniester\n\nPolice in the breakaway Moldovan region of Trans-Dniester said that two explosions knocked two powerful antennas out of service in a radio facility close to Ukrainian border. The interior ministry of the region said those antennas were re-broadcasting Russian radio.\n\nThe incident occurred in a small town of Maiac about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the regional capital Tiraspol and roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said.\n\nThe explosions come just a day after several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the state security ministry in Tiraspol.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu is convening a meeting of the country\'s Supreme Security Council on Tuesday over incidents that took place in Trans-Dniester.\n\nTrans-Dniester is a narrow strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River, sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova. The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield.

How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city.

Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol.

The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk. The Russian report said oil storage tanks at the facility caught fire around 2 a.m. local time.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires show a burning fire at coordinates that correspond to a Rosneft facility some 70 miles north of the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, adviser to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was cited by the Ukrainian news agency Unian as saying that people who live near the burning oil depot were being evacuated.\n\nMoscow has previously blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s top security officials have denied that Kyiv was behind an earlier airstrike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 35 miles from the border.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin Meet With Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country’s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nIt came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia’s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n“Yes, they’re meeting with the president. Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:40'}

For many years, Gazprom and Putin explained how reliable a supplier of natural gas was. In the same way as in January 2009. Then (in 2009) Boyko Borissov had promised diversification, which never took place. The words of Putin and Gazprom are not worth it. Not only that - Borisov built them a gas pipeline that bypassed Ukraine for BGN 3 billion (paid by Bulgarian taxpayers). Bulgaria will cope, there will be gas. Due to the extraordinary circumstances, it will be at a higher price in the beginning, but solutions will be sought in this direction as well. However, Putin\'s Russia has shown that it is not only not a reliable supplier, but also handles medieval racketeering tactics, violating an already concluded agreement under which it will still pay penalties" - commented the MP from Democratic Bulgaria Ivaylo Mirchev.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/OFFNews', 'image': 'https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-04/photo_verybig_214877.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:26'}

In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nAs both sides in the war brace for what could be a grinding battle of attrition in the country’s eastern industrial heartland, top US officials pledged more help to ensure Ukraine prevails.\n\nIn a bold visit to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the American secretaries of state and defence said Washington had approved a 165 million dollar (£129 million) sale of ammunition – non-US ammo, mainly if not entirely to fit Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons – along with more than 300 million dollars (£235 million) in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said after the meeting that the West’s united support for Ukraine and pressure on Moscow are having “real results”.\n\n“When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the American support but said that “as long as Russian soldiers put a foot on Ukrainian soil, nothing is enough”.\n\nMr Kuleba warned that if western powers want Ukraine to win the war and “stop Putin in Ukraine and not to allow him to go further, deeper into Europe”, then countries need to speed up the delivery of the weapons requested by Ukraine.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to “split Russian society and to destroy Russia from within”.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv and perhaps the toppling of its government. But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

It has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of gas payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract.\n\nPoland also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland.\n\nPoland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, and covers about 50pc of national consumption.\n\nEarlier, data from the EU network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted, but they resumed later today.\n\nPoland\'s energy supplies are secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said today, adding that there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut.\n\nThe country can source gas via two links with Germany including a reverse flow on the Yamal pipeline, a link with Lithuania with an annual capacity of 2.5 bcm that will open on May 1 and via an interconnector with the Czech Republic for up to 1.5 bcm.\n\nAnother 5-6 bcm could be shipped via a link with Slovakia to be opened later this year.\n\nIn addition, PGNiG can import up to 6 bcm per year via the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea, and it produces more than 3 bcm of gas per year locally in Poland. In October, a pipeline allowing up to 10 bcm of gas per year to flow between Poland and Norway, will be opened.\n\nGazprom said that Poland would need to begin making payments under a new scheme as of Tuesday. It did not elaborate and did not comment on PGNiG\'s statement about the possible gas supply stoppage.\n\nOnly a few Russian gas buyers, such as Hungary and Uniper, Germany\'s main importer of Russian gas, have said it would be possible to pay for future supplies under the scheme announced by Moscow without breaching EU sanctions.\n\nThe Kremlin said Gazprom was implementing the presidential decree on enforcing payment for gas supplies in roubles.\n\nPGNiG said it would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas according to the Yamal contract and that any halt of supplies was a breach of that contract.\n\nIt added it has the right to pursue damages over breach of contract.\n\nEarlier today, Poland announced a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, that would be subject to sanctions under a law passed earlier this month allowing their assets to be frozen.

The new Russian payment system is "at odds with the agreement that is effective until the end of this year and poses considerable risks for the Bulgarian side," said the energy ministry.\n\nPoland has vowed to end imports of Russian coal, gas and oil, and is pressing other EU countries to rapidly do the same.\n\n"We are prepared for the complete cut off of Russian fossil fuels," Polish Energy Minister Anna Moskwa said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nPoland gets 46 percent of its gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia, according to Forum Energii, a think tank.\n\nPolish authorities insisted that the cutoff won\'t affect gas users.\n\n"Thanks to the implementation of the government\'s strategy of diversifying gas supply sources, PGNiG is prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on the western and southern borders and the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście," said PGNiG.\n\nMoskwa said: "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security," adding that the country\'s gas storage was 80 percent full. She said Poland will continue to buy gas on European and international markets and aims to fill its reserves to 100 percent.\n\nBulgaria, which gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia, said it has "taken steps to ensure alternative supplies of natural gas and handle the situation. Measures to restrict consumption in Bulgaria are unnecessary at this stage."\n\nPoland\'s 1996 agreement with Gazprom expires at the end of the year, and Warsaw has said it won\'t be renewed. Piotr Naimski, in charge of strategic energy infrastructure, said that Poland was already planning to end Russian gas supplies, and that Tuesday\'s decision by Gazprom "speeds that up."\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, news that gas flows from Russia to Poland showed a precipitous decline caused spot gas prices to spike. Month-ahead gas contracts on the EU benchmark TTF trading hub in the Netherlands rose from €91 per megawatt-hour to €107/MWh around 4:30 p.m. before settling back to €99/MWh.\n\nThis article has been updated to add that Gazprom will also stop shipments to Bulgaria.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26/GettyImages-1368239012.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:55'}

Schwedt, which is run by Russia\'s state-owned Rosneft, supplies the vast majority of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region with fuel.\n\nA lack of oil infrastructure linking the former West and East Germany means the country\'s eastern states would have been hit especially hard by an import stop — but a solution is close at hand, Habeck said.\n\nDealing with Schwedt "is the last task that still stands in the way of completely securing the energy supply.

The share of Russian imports is now at 40 percent, down from 55 percent before the war.

He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Le Drian “reiterated France\'s request for the free movement of civilians and free access for humanitarian aid in Mariupol, as in the rest of Ukraine”, the statement noted.\n\nFrance is delivering Caesar cannons with a range of 40 kilometres (25 miles) to Ukraine and is among 40 countries attending the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group meeting hosted by the US at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nJ’ai souhaité confirmer à mon homologue ukrainien @DmytroKuleba que la France maintiendrait son appui déterminé à l’Ukraine face à la guerre à laquelle elle est confrontée : assistance financière, sanctions, équipements de défense, lutte contre l’impunité. pic.twitter.com/9OgtKltUar — Jean-Yves Le Drian (@JY_LeDrian) April 26, 2022\n\n10:32 am: ‘Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine’: US defence chief Austin\n\nOpening the gathering of representatives of more than 40 countries at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called on members of the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group to arrive at “a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to move heaven and earth so that we can meet them”.\n\nAustin, who is chairing the meeting at the US air base, said Kyiv had done “an impressive job defending its sovereignty against Russia’s unprovoked invasion”, adding: "“Ukraine’s valor and skill will go down in military history.”\n\n“Ukraine has now beaten back the Russian military for 62 days. Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\n06:12am: Russia’s Lavrov warns of ‘real threat’ of World War III\n\nRussia has warned of the “real” threat of World War III breaking out, ahead of a Tuesday meeting between the United States and allies over sending further arms to war-torn Ukraine.\n\nMoscow’s invasion of its neighbour has triggered an outburst of support from Western nations that has seen weapons pour into the country to help it wage war against Russian troops.\n\nBut Western powers have been reluctant to deepen their involvement, for fear of sparking a conflict against nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nSpeaking to Russian news agencies, Moscow’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the risk of a World War III “is serious” and criticised Kyiv’s approach to floundering peace talks.\n\n“It is real, you can’t underestimate it,” Lavrov said.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Vedika Bahl brings us a recap of Monday’s events:\n\n01:49 Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, April 7, 2022. © Reuters\n\n04:36am: Pressure mounts on Germany’s Schroeder over Russia ties\n\nPressure was growing Monday inside Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) to expel their former leader and ex-chancellor Gerhard Schroeder over his apparent refusal to renounce his business ties with Russia.\n\nSchroeder, who is a lobbyist for Russian gas and has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, sparked fresh outrage following remarks in an interview with the New York Times published this weekend.\n\nUnrepentant over his business links with Russia, he told the newspaper: “I don’t do mea culpa. It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and REUTERS)\n\n© Studio graphique France Médias Monde\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/e48d305a-c59a-11ec-898c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/20220426-gazprom-m.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:46'}

Mr Zelensky added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nHe noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow was also on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nMr Austin said Mr Zelensky’s response to the aid was deep appreciation for what was being given but “he has the mindset that they want to win and we have the mindset that we want to help them win”.\n\nThe talks came as Russia unleashed a string of attacks against Ukrainian rail and fuel facilities on Monday, striking crucial infrastructure far from the front line of its eastern offensive, which Britain said has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, third from left, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, forth from left, meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, fourth from right, in Kyiv (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nMeanwhile, two fires were reported at oil facilities in western Russia. It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was a lightning offensive that would quickly take the capital and perhaps even topple the government in Kyiv. But the Ukrainians, aided by Western weapons, bogged down President Vladimir Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its focus is in the eastern region of the Donbas, but one senior military official says it also wants to control southern Ukraine. While both sides said the campaign in the east has begun, it has yet to gather steam.\n\nA small group of Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces, and keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor on Monday for them to leave.\n\nRussian tanks roll along a street in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Mariupol, Ukraine (Alexei Alexandrov/AP)\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nBut for now, the British Defence Ministry said that Ukrainian forces have repelled numerous assaults in the past week and “inflicted significant cost on Russian forces”. It said, so far, Russia has “yet to achieve a significant breakthrough” since shifting its focus to the Donbas.\n\nInstead, Russian missiles and war planes struck far behind the front line of that offensive on Monday.\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday, including a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nSerhiy Borzov, the governor of Ukraine’s central Vinnytsia region, said there were casualties after rocket strikes targeting “critical infrastructure”. It was not clear if that referred to the attacks on the railways.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries.\n\nA Russian news report said that another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire early Monday.\n\nIn footage later released by the Ukrainian presidency of the meeting with top US officials, Mr Blinken praised the “extraordinary courage and leadership and success that you’ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression”.\n\n“We got used to seeing you on video around the world, but it’s great, it’s good to see you in person,” he said with a smile.\n\nMr Austin said at the news conference that “the world has been inspired” by Ukraine in the war and that America will continue its support. “What you’ve done in repelling the Russians in the Battle of Kyiv is extraordinary,” he said.\n\nMr Zelensky had announced on Saturday that he would meet the US officials in Kyiv on Sunday, but Joe Biden’s administration refused to confirm that and declined to discuss details of a possible visit even though planning had been under way for more than a week.\n\nJournalists who travelled to Poland with Mr Austin and Mr Blinken were barred from reporting on the trip until it ended, were not allowed to accompany them on their overland journey into Ukraine, and were prohibited from specifying where in south-east Poland they waited for the Cabinet members to return. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon cited security concerns.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nMr Austin and Mr Blinken announced a total of 713 million dollars (£555 million) in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries; some 322 million dollars (£251 million) of that is earmarked for Kyiv. The remainder will be split among Nato members and other nations that have provided Ukraine with critical military supplies since the war with Russia began, officials said.\n\nSuch financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need.\n\nThe new money, along with the sale of 165 million dollars (£128 million) in non-US made ammunition that is compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use, takes the total amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to 3.7 billion dollars (£2.9 billion) since the invasion, officials said.\n\nUS officials said they believed the new assistance would satisfy at least some of the Ukrainians’ urgent pleas for more help. New artillery, including howitzers, continues to be delivered at a rapid pace to Ukraine’s military, which is being trained on its use in neighbouring countries, the officials said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\nOn the diplomatic front and as expected, President Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nMs Brink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council.

(Julien Warnand/Pool via Reuters)\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said that insufficient support from the bloc’s member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports can’t yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on April 25. “A final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nThose sanctions, EU officials say, are designed to minimize damage to the economies of the 27 member states while preventing the Kremlin from benefiting from lucrative income derived from energy exports, which serve as the Kremlin’s main source of foreign currency.\n\nSome experts believe those energy payments are effectively being used to finance and bolster Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine.\n\n“We are working on a sixth sanctions package and one of the issues we are considering is some form of an oil embargo,” European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told The Times of London. “When we are imposing sanctions, we need to do so in a way that maximizes pressure on Russia while minimizing collateral damage on ourselves.”\n\nSpecific details regarding the oil sanctions haven’t yet been agreed upon by EU members, but could potentially see a gradual “phasing out” of Russian oil or tariffs imposed on exports beyond a certain price cap, according to The Times of London.\n\nRussia is also one of the world’s largest producers of oil and natural gas, accounting for 17 percent of the world’s natural gas and 12 percent of its oil.\n\nIt’s also Europe’s biggest oil supplier, providing slightly more than a quarter, or 26 percent, of EU oil imports in 2020, according to data from the bloc’s statistics office Eurostat.\n\nDespite the string of sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia in recent months, Russia is expected to earn nearly $321 billion from energy exports in 2022, an increase of more than a third from 2021, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nBut while some EU states welcome a ban on Russian oil and gas, others, such as Germany—where energy prices have surged nearly 40 percent—are opposed to an immediate oil embargo, fearing the economic consequences it may have on the country, given that it currently purchases about 25 percent of its oil and 40 percent of its gas from Russia.\n\nBorrell noted on April 25 that all EU states are working to become less dependent on Russian oil and gas in light of recent events and that he believes member states will eventually be able to do so, although a clear timeline isn’t in sight.\n\n“At some point, it will happen and then Russia will feel painfully that the revenues from the oil and gas business are being lost,” Borrell said.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/09/15/2021-09-14T140818Z_1_LYNXMPEH8D0NG_RTROPTP_4_AFGHANISTAN-CONFLICT-EU-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:07'}

Belarusians are a joke — as Russia\'s creeping annexation of their country suggests. And Ukrainians are delusional fascists with no right to exist — as Russian president Vladimir Putin has openly stated.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nGermany isn\'t quite as arrogant in its views of its eastern neighbours, but neither is it as welcoming as the open-hearted German self-image would suggest.\n\nFor Berlin, Poles are difficult — failing to appreciate that they need to follow Germany\'s sage example if they want to be fully European. The pejorative term "Polnische Wirtschaft" (meaning "Polish household") is no longer in use, but the sentiment remains.\n\nBelarusians are a cypher ruled by a dictator, while Ukrainians are hopelessly corrupt and quarrelsome — or were, until Russia attacked Ukraine on 24 February and unleashed a genocidal war.\n\nMeanwhile, continued German reference to World War II as the "Russlandkrieg" (meaning "Russia War") nicely illustrates ongoing German attitudes.\n\nGermany attacked, occupied, and destroyed huge swaths of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. Belarus lost about a third of its population, Poland and Ukraine a little under a fifth, and Jews, who lived in all three countries, were subjected to almost complete annihilation in the Holocaust.\n\nBy that grim comparison, Russia actually remained largely untouched — a Russia War indeed.\n\nThe current war on Ukraine has only reinforced Russia\'s dismissive attitudes toward Poles, Belarusians, and Ukrainians.\n\nFor Moscow, the Poles are "chronic Russo-phobes," Belarusians are unreliable allies, and Ukrainians must be destroyed.\n\nThe war has also begun to change German perceptions, most notably with respect to Ukrainians. Berlin has condemned the Russian aggression, adopted severe sanctions, mothballed the Nord Stream II pipeline, and supplied Ukraine with arms.\n\nBut old habits die hard — former German chancellor Angela Merkel still refuses to admit that her policies toward Russia enabled Putin.\n\nFormer chancellor Gerhard Schröder remains an unrepentant Putin apologist and a tacit supporter of Putin\'s genocide in Ukraine.\n\nDüsseldorf\'s ex-mayor, Thomas Geisel, a social democrat like Schröder, openly questions whether Russian atrocities in Ukraine are really as serious as Ukrainians say they are, while a group of left-wingers is calling on the German government to stop delivering arms to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to German analyst Constanze Stelzenmueller: "Germany\'s self-serving Russia policy and its self-inflicted energy dependence — part wilfully naive, part deeply corrupt — found eager supporters across the political party spectrum. They emboldened the Kremlin, and they enabled Vladimir Putin\'s war."\n\nThe fact is that, just as Russia\'s distaste for its eastern neighbours includes pretty much the whole spectrum of relevant political elites, so, too, Germany\'s prioritising of Russia still remains the default position of its establishment.\n\nSo, when German finance minister Christian Lindner said on 23 April that "we must do everything in our power to help Ukraine win, but the limit of the ethical responsibility is endangering our own security and endangering the defence capability of Nato territory," one appreciates his concern for Ukraine, but one also notes that he all but openly says Germany\'s security is not dependent on Ukraine, while it is dependent on Russia.\n\nGreat power games\n\nWhy do Germany and Russia think so much alike about their neighbours in between?\n\nThe answer may lie in history and in geopolitics: both countries have been great powers since the mid-18th century and their "natural" field of contention and cooperation has been eastern Europe. It stands to reason that their mental maps of the region would be similar.\n\nUnsurprisingly, eastern Europeans often view their relationship with Germany and Russia as similar to being trapped between a hammer and an anvil.\n\nAnd with good reason — modern history is full of examples of Russo-German conflict and cooperation resulting in death and destruction for the countries in between.\n\nRussia and Prussia (the forerunner of modern Germany) colluded in three partitions of Poland in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nWilhelmine Germany and Tsarist Russia were on opposing sides in World War I, and most of the warfare took place in today\'s Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland.\n\nIn 1922, Soviet Russia and Weimar Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo, thereby recognising each other diplomatically and opening the door to economic and military cooperation that enabled Germany to rearm. The losers were, once again, the newly independent states of eastern Europe.\n\nRusso-German relations temporarily worsened after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, but collaboration resumed after a Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in 1939, resulting in the fourth Polish partition and Russian aggression against the Baltic states.\n\nTwo years later, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and, as during the previous world war, the death and destruction were centred on the peoples of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine.\n\nPost-war Germany\'s policy of Ostpolitik led to a normalisation of relations with the Communist regimes of the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany, but eastern European democratic dissidents paid the price.\n\nFormer German chancellor Willy Brandt urged the Solidarność trade union movement in Poland to stop striking in 1980, and then, in 1985, while on an official state visit, purposely refrained from meeting with Solidarność activists, clearly signalling who Bonn\'s preferred interlocutors were and where Germany\'s interests supposedly lay.\n\nThe revolutions of 1989, Germany\'s reunification in 1990, and the Soviet Union\'s collapse in 1991 paved the way for the pro-Russian and pro-Putin policies that helped make Europe dependent on Russian gas, demonised Ukraine as irredeemably corrupt, and ignored the telltale signs of Putin\'s openly aggressive stance toward Russia\'s neighbours.\n\nGermany\'s neglect of its eastern neighbours and Russia\'s hostility to them facilitated the ongoing genocidal war.\n\nNo more great powers\n\nInasmuch as eastern Europeans have suffered both when Germany and Russia have fought and when they have cooperated, the solution to this problem has to be geopolitical.\n\nIn the short run, that means Ukraine\'s victory over Russia.\n\nIn the long run, Germany must remain a middle power and Russia must be denied great-power status. De-Putinizing the regime will help, but the only durable solution for peace is for Russia to break apart.', 'image': 'https://media.euobserver.com/771665bd9becd54a78aff46c75478260-800x.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:41'}

"And now at 90 years old, I have to experience another war," she added as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier leaned toward her.\n\nNeyman is from the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, or Dnipro. Now in emergency accommodation on the eastern outskirts of Berlin, she described to the German head of state how, during World War II, her mother fled with her to the North Caucasus region and then, as the Nazi army advanced, to Kazakhstan: "We tried to survive somehow."\n\nThe hail of bombs\n\nAnother survivor is Svetlana Sabudkina, a little younger than Neyman, who was born in Kyiv. She recalled how she "got caught in the hail of bombs" as a child with her Jewish mother in the city of Kharkiv and then survived in the Ural Mountains, where "a kind-hearted Russian woman took us in."\n\nSabundkina also remembers postwar Kyiv, when German soldiers, prisoners of war, helped to rebuild the destroyed city. She shared her school lunch with one of them: "I felt sorry for him."\n\nGermany\'s Steinmeier told the group of six Holocaust survivors, who escaped Ukraine to Germany despite their advanced ages, "It breaks my heart to meet people who have had to flee a war twice in their lives and now don\'t know if they will ever be able to return home."\n\nSteinmeier listens to Neyman\'s story\n\n\'Vicious cynicism\'\n\nSteinmeier said he was deeply affected by their stories. He spoke of the "truly vicious cynicism" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had cited the baseless claim of "denazification" as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine. The stories of these survivors, Steinmeier said, are proof of Putin\'s hypocrisy.\n\nMost of them come from eastern Ukraine, specifically Dnipro, a city that has been hit by Russian missiles almost every day for weeks. Steinmeier asked whether they were all transported by bus, to which Neyman responded that it took three days in an ambulance to get to the Ukrainian-Polish border. All six of them traveled to Poland, she said, and then on to Germany.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Steinmeier spoke of his mother, who was among the many ethnic Germans expelled from Poland at the end of World War II. "We were always very aware of what it means to lose your house and home and have to start over completely again," he said.\n\nSteinmeier\'s visit was well-received by the group of elderly survivors, one of whom asked for a selfie as he left. The others thanked him when he told them: "You are welcome here, you can rely on our help."\n\nThis reception came in stark contrast to the criticism directed at the president in recent weeks, which saw Kyiv refuse his offer of an official visit after he was accused of being too sympathetic to Russia during his two terms as foreign minister. Instead of traveling to Ukraine, he has been meeting displaced Ukrainians in Germany as well as Ukraine\'s Eastern European neighbors.\n\nJewish groups organize evacuations\n\nSo far, nearly 80 Holocaust survivors have fled to Germany from Ukraine and are being housed across the country.\n\nThe "El Jana" home in eastern Berlin is still fairly new. The full-time care facility was completed shortly before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and has not yet been fully occupied. Although the building is subjected to the roar of the nearby airport, street traffic, and trains, the building is an oasis of peace for its new inhabitants.\n\nThat the dozens of survivors have made it to Germany is thanks to the commitment and help from the Jewish Claims Conference (JCC), an organization that has been providing financial and medical assistance to Holocaust survivors for years.\n\nAs soon as they realized that the Russian invasion could jeopardize that assistance, the JCC set to work organizing evacuations. At first, only a handful wanted to leave their homes, but that number gradually increased, according to Rüdiger Mahlo, the JCC\'s representative in Germany.\n\nFor those who did not want to come to Germany, evacuations were also organized for Israel or other European destinations.\n\nWatch video 00:59 Ukrainian Holocaust survivors take shelter in Germany\n\nHelping hands\n\nAccording to Mahlo, more evacuees are arriving in Germany every day, a process that required around 50 people from 15 different organizations, including the Central Welfare Office of Jews in Germany (ZWST). Those assisting on a daily basis include full-time employees of welfare associations, but also many volunteers.\n\nAid workers have also been quick to thank the support of locals, who have donated the clothes, medical equipment, and other necessities that the new arrivals need.\n\nFor the El Jana facility, this also means a demanding commitment from employees who speak Russian, according to director Laura Rose. "For them, it means twelve-hour shifts now. There must always be someone there, even at night and on weekends, who speaks Russian," she said.\n\nAlthough the survivors thanked Steinmeier for the hospitality they have received in Germany, they made it clear that their wish for the future is to return to Ukraine.\n\n"Thank you for the very warm welcome. But still, we all want to go home as soon as possible," they told the president.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you\'re here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

As Jourová indicated, banking sector sanctions are highly likely to be accepted as there are signs of a consensus among the EU countries.\n\nThe European Commission wants to widen the sanction list to include more people and entities.\n\nThe EU has already imposed five rounds of sanctions against Russia, including an embargo on Russian coal imports and a ban on Russian and Belarusian freight road operators working in the EU.', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57600345-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:24'}

"We are here to support you in any way possible."\n\nSaid Blinken: "The reason we\'re back is because of you, because of the extraordinary courage, leadership and success that you\'ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression."\n\nUS officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for Zelensky\'s government and other countries in the region. An extra $322 million in military aid for Ukraine would take total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, one official said.\n\n"It will provide support for capabilities Ukraine needs, especially the fight in the Donbas," the official said. It would also help Ukraine\'s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defence systems -- essentially NATO capable systems, the official added on condition of anonymity.\n\nWestern arms for Ukraine have infuriated Moscow. Russia\'s ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note stressing "the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice".\n\nThe meeting between the US delegation and Ukraine\'s leaders ran for three hours, or more than double the allotted time, a US official said.\n\n"In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded," Blinken told a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine\'s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nJust weeks ago, Kyiv was a frontline city under curfew and bombardment, with tens of thousands of Russian troops massing on its northern outskirts. Residents spent nights huddled in its metro stations, sheltering from artillery.\n\nToday, the nearest Russian troops are hundreds of miles away, normal life is returning to the capital, Western leaders have been visiting and countries are reopening their embassies.\n\nBlinken said US diplomats would first return to Lviv in the west and should be back in Kyiv within weeks.\n\nBut despite Ukraine having repelled the assault on Kyiv, the war is far from over. Russia has regrouped its forces and sent more troops in to eastern Ukraine. Last week it launched a massive assault there in an attempt to capture eastern provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nRAILWAY STATIONS HIT\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying. Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot. There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\'s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nIn a daily update on the conflict, Britain\'s defence ministry said Russia had only made minor advances in some parts of Donbas.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nIn an emotional address at Kyiv\'s 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral to mark the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday, Zelensky said his nation would overcome "dark times".\n\nWAR GRINDS ON\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country, where the war grinds on relentlessly.\n\nSome 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\nRussia also fired rockets at two towns in the central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\nUkraine\'s general staff described Russian shelling and assaults along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steel works in Mariupol where the last Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a city destroyed during two months of Russian siege and bombardment.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation", denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, Britain\'s The Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.', 'image': 'https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/04/25/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg/BINARY/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:55'}

Once referred to as the European ‘hegemon’ during the euro crisis, Berlin is now showing hesitance and indecisiveness instead of leading Europe through what could be described as the crisis of the century.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany has been pressing the brakes the hardest when it comes to European efforts to put the spoiler of international peace in its place.\n\nIn almost every sanction round – from banning Russia from SWIFT in March to the current issue of energy imports – Germany is one of the last countries to drop its opposition and clear the way for joint EU action against the aggressor.\n\nThe same picture emerges when it comes to weapons deliveries, where Germany is still hesitant to provide Ukraine with the tanks they need to fend off the Russians in Donbas.\n\nGiven the current political fiasco, it is hard to believe that Germany was once feared as reaching an almost hegemonic position in Europe during the euro crisis, where it managed to impose its vision of austerity on the continent.\n\nBut how did we get here, and why is Europe’s economic powerhouse lacking any serious capacity to guide us through this crisis?\n\nThe easy answer is, of course, to point the finger at Chancellor Olaf Scholz and say he is the one stalling the process and showing indecisiveness in Ukraine’s hour of need. Something like this would have never happened if Angela Merkel were still in power, critics utter in Berlin and Brussels.\n\nHowever, this is only part of the story. While Scholz’s leadership skills have been criticised in recent weeks – even by his coalition partners in the FDP and the Greens – the problem is much more profound.\n\nFor Germany, foreign policy was always rooted in its economic interests. It resembled more of an external economic policy instead of focusing on the tough decisions that come with the mess that is international security.\n\nLeadership in Europe meant, first and foremost, protecting its economic interests and spreading its ordoliberal model across Europe.\n\nThis ‘economy first’ approach was, of course, also the reason why Berlin could exert dominance during the euro and Greek debt crisis because all that foreign policy was about was economics.\n\nIn hindsight, it almost feels as if Germany stumbled through the messy place that is international security blindfolded. After all, Merkel was responsible for Germany’s energy dependency on Russia.\n\nAnd economic interests once again prevailed over security concerns when she disregarded the warnings by allies and laid the groundwork for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline – only a few years after Russia revealed its true colours in Ukraine and annexed Crimea.\n\nGermany managed to lead Europe as long as the EU was primarily concerned with questions of economic integration and the problems that come with it. But now, where Europe has to sacrifice its economic interests to support Ukraine, and the situation requires strong geopolitical leadership, Berlin is not up to the challenge.\n\nAfter all, Germany is currently forced to walk on a turf it is not used to – geopolitics.\n\nThe Roundup\n\nThanks to efforts to diversify oil suppliers and with support from the Polish government, Germany is days away from being independent of Russian oil, Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said.\n\nThe European Union warned Tuesday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine risks setting off a fresh nuclear disaster in Europe, 36 years after the accident at the Chernobyl plant.\n\nThe German ‘traffic light’ coalition will intensify its efforts to support Ukraine with weapons and is green-lighting the delivery of heavy weaponry by industry, marking a distinct change in approach.\n\nTwo explosions damaged Soviet-era radio masts that broadcast Russian radio from a village in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria on Tuesday, prompting Moldova’s president to convene an urgent security meeting.\n\nA member of the European Central Bank’s executive board has criticised crypto finance for its lack of transparency and the risks it poses to financial stability, describing crypto-assets as “speculative assets that can cause major damage to society” and calling for a faster and more stringent regulation.\n\nThe European Commission’s proposal to fight child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online is still pending, while the EU has become a ‘destination of choice’ when it comes to hosting such content, according to a new report.\n\nThe EU Court of Justice (CJEU) has upheld the controversial Article 17 of the Copyright Directive, meaning platforms will be directly liable for – and responsible for removing – copyrighted content uploaded to their sites.\n\nDiscontent with the absence of a hoped-for electoral reform in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, Zagreb has blasted as “illegitimate” the upcoming elections in BiH, while the European Commission repeated they were key for the fragile Balkan country’s European future.', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Shared-Link-The-Hub-Article-Templates-Options-45-800x450.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:17'}

We have only cars and trains now," he said.\n\nThe still-operational rail links in the country have also come into political focus in recent weeks, with various foreign leaders using the trains to visit Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine.\n\n"All Western leaders who arrived to Ukraine, arrived by train.

The ceasefire is set to begin at 2 p.m. Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Monday.\n\nThe ministry said any civilians trapped at the facility could leave in whichever direction they chose.\n\nOn April 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he cancelled plans to storm the Azovstal plant in Mariupol. He said he wanted the plant to be securely blockaded instead.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian fighters at the Azovstal plant reported heavy shelling and Russian attacks in recent days.\n\nAzovstal is the last remaining pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the key port of Mariupol.\n\nGermany\'s Steinmeier meets Ukrainian Holocaust survivors\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Ukrainian Holocaust survivors in Berlin and said that he hoped that refugees in Germany would feel safe from further attacks.\n\nSteinmeier met the survivors during a visit to a care facility in Berlin\'s eastern neighborhood of Marzahn.\n\nThe six Holocaust survivors told Steinmeier stories of their escape from Ukrainian cities, which in some cases lasted several days. The four women and two men were brought to Germany with the help of Jewish organizations.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the president\'s office, around 70 Holocaust survivors from Ukraine who are in need of serious care have so far been admitted in 11 German cities.\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Holocaust survivors in Berlin who fled Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia \'greeted\' Ukraine on Easter with missile strikes, Zelenskyy said\n\nIn a morning video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia "greeted" Ukraine with missiles strikes over the weekend, when Orthodox Easter was celebrated. The majority of population in both Russia and Ukraine are Orthodox Christians.\n\n"Why was this blow needed at Easter? There is no military threat from which this could protect Russia. This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the biggest Orthodox holiday," Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also spoke about yesterday\'s visit by top US officials. "Assistance to Ukraine was the number one issue in talks with representatives of the United States of America, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin," Zelenskyy said.\n\n"We share the same understanding with the United States: when democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world. When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world," said the Ukrainian president.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskyy also mentioned the morning air raids in the Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv and Odesa regions.

The attacks reportedly targeted "critical infrastructure" in the region, he said. Both cities are important railway junctions on the route from Kyiv to western Ukraine.\n\nBorzov also said the strikes caused deaths and injuries, but he did not give any numbers.\n\nRailway stations struck by missiles — Ukrainian railway chief\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine have been hit by missile strikes, according to the head of the country\'s railways, Oleksandr Kamyshin.\n\n"Russian forces are systematically destroying the infrastructure of our railways," Kamyshin said on his Telegram channel.\n\nKamyshin added that trains are being forced to alter routes and schedules for security reasons.\n\nReports of missile attacks also emerged in the western city of Lviv and southwestern city of Vinnytsia.\n\nAccording to Maksym Kozytskyy, the governor of the western Lviv region, an explosion occurred on Monday morning at the traction substation of the Krasne railway station as a result of a missile strike.\n\nOne missile was destroyed by Ukrainian air defense.

He had no information yet about possible victims.\n\nKyiv needs long-range fires and tanks — US Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed and that Kyiv now needs long-range fires for both artillery and missiles, as well as tanks.\n\nAustin said that he and Blinken had discussed "security assistance" and "training" with Ukrainian officials. He said that the meeting was to talk about things that would "enable us to win the current fight and also build for tomorrow."\n\n"We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," Austin said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke to reporters following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nAustin is scheduled to go to the Ramstein US Air Base in western Germanyon Tuesday to speak with allies on how best to support Ukraine.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense said it is difficult for the US to track what happens to weapons transferred to Ukraine as there are no US forces on the ground, but added that he spoke to Kyiv to make sure weapons were tracked as best as possible.\n\nRussia \'failing\' in its war aims — Blinken\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press conference following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Russia has been "failing" when it came to its war aims in Ukraine, while Kyiv is "succeeding."\n\n"Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine," Blinken said. "That has failed."\n\nBlinken said that Russia\'s military was underperforming and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin\'s on the scene," Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees "final success."\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "things are beginning to get back to normal" in Kyiv, but noted that "that\'s in stark contrast to what\'s going on" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas — UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain\'s defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, "Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials.

Many European countries have contributed substantial military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, and third-largest spender Germany boosted its military aid budget to €2 billion a little over a week ago.\n\nThe United States saw a drop in expenditure in 2021 due to a drop in American spending on research and development. The US is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, having provided an additional $800 million in mid-April and another $322 million this Sunday.\n\nWatch video 02:24 US approves more military aid to Ukraine\n\nBlinken and Austin announce aid, diplomatic surge\n\nThe United States will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military financing and has approved a $165 million sale of ammunition to the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe announcement came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt was the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war.\n\nThe US officials also pledged further assistance worth $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries, with the $322 million earmarked specifically for Kyiv.\n\nThe new money brings the total amount of US military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said.\n\nThe two returned overland to Poland after their meeting.

(AP Photo/Felipe Dana) (Felipe Dana)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine — (AP) — Russia unleashed a string of attacks Monday against rail and fuel installations deep inside Ukraine, far from the front lines of Moscow’s new eastern offensive, as Russia’s top diplomat warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.”\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, moved to rush more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from the Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n“Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared, a day after he and the U.S. secretary of defense made a bold visit to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nBlinken said Washington approved a $165 million sale of ammunition — non-U.S. ammo, mainly if not entirely for Ukraine\'s Soviet-era weapons — and will also provide more than $300 million in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin took his comments further, saying that while the U.S. wants to see Ukraine remain a sovereign, democratic country, it also wants "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nAustin’s comments about weakening Russia appeared to represent a shift in broader U.S. strategic goals. Previously, the U.S. position had been that the goal of American military aid was to help Ukraine win and to defend Ukraine’s NATO neighbors against Russian threats.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said weapons supplied by Western countries “will be a legitimate target," adding that Russian forces had already targeted weapons warehouses in western Ukraine.\n\n“Everyone is reciting incantations that in no case can we allow World War III,” Lavrov said in a wide-ranging interview on Russian television. He accused Ukrainian leaders of provoking Russia by asking NATO to become involved in the conflict.\n\nBy providing weapons, NATO forces are “pouring oil on the fire,” he said, according to a transcript on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website.\n\nRegarding the possibility of a nuclear confrontation, Lavrov said: “I would not want to see these risks artificially inflated now, when the risks are rather significant.”\n\n“The danger is serious," he said. "It is real. It should not be underestimated.”\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv, the capital. But the Ukrainians, with the help of Western weapons, thwarted the push and forced President Vladimir Putin\'s troops to retreat.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is to take the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking industrial region in eastern Ukraine. While both sides say the campaign in the east is underway, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and warplanes striking far behind the front lines in an effort to thwart Ukrainian efforts to marshal supplies for the fight.\n\nFive railroad stations in central and western Ukraine were hit, and one worker was killed, said Oleksandr Kamyshin, head of Ukraine\'s state railway. The bombardment included a missile attack near Lviv, the western city close to the Polish border that has been swelled by Ukrainians fleeing the fighting elsewhere around the country.\n\nUkrainian authorities said at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk, in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. general who was NATO’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said the latest strikes against fuel depots are part of a strategy to deplete key Ukrainian war resources. The strikes against rail targets, on the other hand, are a newer tactic, he said.\n\n“I think they’re doing it for the legitimate reason of trying to interdict the flow of supplies to the front,” he said. “The illegitimate reason is they know people are trying to leave the country, and this is just another intimidation, terrorist tactic to make them not have faith and confidence in traveling on the rails.”\n\nPhillips P. O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nIn Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova that sits along the Ukrainian border, several explosions believed caused by rocket-propelled grenades hit the territory\'s Ministry of State Security. There was no immediate claim of responsibility or reports of injuries. Transnistria is a strip of land with about 470,000 people and about 1,500 Russian troops based there.\n\nMoldova\'s Foreign Ministry said “the aim of today’s incident is to create pretexts for straining the security situation in the Transnistrian region." The U.S. warned previously that Russia may launch “false-flag” attacks against its own side to create a pretext for invading other nations.\n\nLast week, Rustam Minnekayev, a Russian military commander, said the Kremlin wants full control of southern Ukraine, which he said would open the way to Transnistria.\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic southern port city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas. Over the weekend, Russian forces launched new airstrikes on the Azovstal plant to try to dislodge the holdouts.\n\nSome 1,000 civilians were also said to be taking shelter at the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor Monday for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with skepticism by Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nThe city council and mayor of Mariupol said a new mass grave has been identified about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities were trying to estimate the number of victims. It was at least the third new mass grave discovered in Russian-controlled areas near Mariupol in the last week.\n\nMariupol has been gutted by bombardment and fierce street fighting over the past two months. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, the capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said his country\'s goal is to maintain resistance and “make the occupiers’ stay in our land even more intolerable,” while Russia drains its resources.\n\nA top Ukrainian official cast doubt on the prospect of further talks between the two countries. Recent sessions in Istanbul ended without resolution earlier this month.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview that any negotiations other than talks between Zelenskyy and Putin would bring little resolution.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective."\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Yuras Karmanau and Jon Gambrell in Lviv, Ukraine, and AP staff around the world contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\'s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

For all of RFE/RL\'s coverage of the war, click here.\n\nFighting continued on April 26 in eastern Ukraine, where the city of Kreminna in the Luhansk region has reportedly fallen to the Russians.\n\nStreet-to-street fighting had been going on for days in Kreminna, with civilian evacuations there made impossible by the war, the British Ministry of Defense said on Twitter on April 26.\n\nThe British report said heavy fighting was under way in the south of the city of Izyum, as Russian forces try to advance toward the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defenses in Zaporizhzhya in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," it added in the regular bulletin, also saying that Russian troops were likely to attempt to encircle Ukrainian Army\'s heavily fortified positions in the east.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that more help for Ukraine was on the way, as he convened a meeting of officials from around 40 countries at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany to pledge more weapons.\n\n"This gathering reflects the galvanized world," Austin said in his opening remarks .He added that he wanted officials to leave the meeting “with a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to keep moving heaven and earth so that we can meet them.”\n\nAfter the meeting, Austin said in a press conference that the forum would continue as a monthly contact group that would discuss Ukraine\'s defense needs.\n\n"The contact group will be a vehicle for nations of goodwill to intensify our efforts, coordinate our assistance, and focus on winning today\'s fight and the struggles to come," Austin said.\n\nAustin also praised a decision by Germany, which said it had cleared the way for the delivery of Gepard antiaircraft guns to Ukraine.\n\nAustin -- who visited Ukraine with Blinken over the weekend and announced an extra $700 million in military aid to Ukraine -- said Washington wants to see "Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," adding that Kyiv can still win the war if given the right support.\n\nThe United States has sent some $4 billion in military aid since President Joe Biden\'s term began last year, and already announced a new $800 million aid package last week.\n\nLavrov said late on April 25 that Western arms shipments to Ukraine mean that NATO is essentially engaging in war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy, and weapons delivered to Ukraine from the West will be "legitimate targets" for the Russian military.\n\nLavrov also warned of the threat of a third world war and said there was a "considerable" risk of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons.\n\n"The danger is serious, it is real, it must not be underestimated," Lavrov said.\n\nBut Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Lavrov\'s comments are meant to just "scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\nEarlier, Russia\'s ambassador in Washington told the United States to halt arms shipments, warning that large Western deliveries of weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nWith reporting by AP, AFP, BBC, and Reuters', 'image': 'https://gdb.rferl.org/2ED3AF50-E135-48F8-B1B5-2BFEDB2AE3E1_cx0_cy2_cw0_w1200_r1.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:15'}

Kyiv won 3-2 in a charity match played in front of about 35,000 fans. All proceeds will go to victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n"It is about sending a signal, a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, earning a bit of money so that we can do one or the other humanitarian action. And then it is also a sign against this despicable war of aggression," Dortmund managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke told broadcasters ZDF.\n\nKyiv has played similar fund-raising matches in Warsaw, Istanbul and Cluj.\n\nPutin claims he hopes for diplomatic agreement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Moscow. In televised remarks, he told Guterres that he still hoped for negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject [talks]," Putin told Guterres, who was visiting Moscow.\n\nHe said talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv. He claimed without evidence, that the massacres in Bucha were not carried out by Russians.\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nGuterres reiterated his call for Ukraine and Russia to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe broadcast discussions showed Guterres and Putin sitting opposite each other at the large oval table in the hall of the Senate Palace, following an hour-long meeting in the Kremlin. Guterres earlier met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov where he called for a ceasefire.\n\nItaly considers nationalizing Lukoil-owned refinery\n\nItaly is reportedly considering temporarily nationalizing a refinery owned by Lukoil — a Russian multinational energy corporation — as a response to possible sanctions on Russian oil.\n\nLukoil, which is not the subject of sanctions, owns the ISAB refinery — Italy\'s largest oil refinery by capacity. It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense. Speaking at the event, Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense, told reporters that "we have to move at the speed of war."\n\nAustin said the US was determined to make better use of the US European Command\'s coordination mechanism and would extend the forum for Ukraine\'s defense into a monthly contact group.\n\n"We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and make it less able to do that," Austin said.\n\nAustin went on to express sharp criticism of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who warned on Monday that World War III might be looming.\n\n"You\'ve heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful," Austin said. "Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence.

This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing. Mantoo added that Syria has the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled the country.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nUN doubles Ukraine aid appeal to $2.25 billion\n\nThe United Nations\' humanitarian agency (UN OCHA) said that it has been forced to double its aid appeal to $2.25 billion (€2.11 billion) as the humanitarian situation in the country worsens.\n\n"Over $2.25 billion is now required for needs inside Ukraine, more than double of the amount requested ($1.1 billion) when we launched the appeal on 1 March, a few days after the war began," the UN OCHA said in a statement.\n\nUS, allies will \'move heaven and Earth\' to meet Ukrainian security requirements — Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the aim of the conference at the air base in Ramstein, Germany was to "help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion," as well as to "build up Ukraine\'s defenses for tomorrow\'s challenges."\n\nAustin said that he discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Kyiv\'s "changing requirements" as Russia focuses on Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.

The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes. Russia\'s Defense Ministry claimed it used missiles to destroy facilities powering the railways supplying Ukrainian forces with foreign weapons.\n\nAbout 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. Ukraine has claimed 22,000 Russian troops were killed since the invasion. Russia has acknowledged only 1,351 military deaths.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalize parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims.\n\nAfter a visit to Kyiv, Blinken said Russia\'s military was underperforming, and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nWatch video 02:54 Russian missiles strike Ukrainian rail stations\n\nYou can revisit our live updates from April 25 here.\n\nsi, lo, aw/wmr, rs, mhm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61602081_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:44'}

The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk. The Russian report said oil storage tanks at the facility caught fire around 2 a.m. local time.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires show a burning fire at coordinates that correspond to a Rosneft facility some 70 miles north of the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, adviser to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was cited by the Ukrainian news agency Unian as saying that people who live near the burning oil depot were being evacuated.\n\nMoscow has previously blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s top security officials have denied that Kyiv was behind an earlier airstrike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 35 miles from the border.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin Meet With Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country’s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nIt came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia’s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n“Yes, they’re meeting with the president. Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:40'}

Then (in 2009) Boyko Borissov had promised diversification, which never took place. The words of Putin and Gazprom are not worth it. Not only that - Borisov built them a gas pipeline that bypassed Ukraine for BGN 3 billion (paid by Bulgarian taxpayers). Bulgaria will cope, there will be gas. Due to the extraordinary circumstances, it will be at a higher price in the beginning, but solutions will be sought in this direction as well. However, Putin\'s Russia has shown that it is not only not a reliable supplier, but also handles medieval racketeering tactics, violating an already concluded agreement under which it will still pay penalties" - commented the MP from Democratic Bulgaria Ivaylo Mirchev.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/OFFNews', 'image': 'https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-04/photo_verybig_214877.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:26'}

In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nAs both sides in the war brace for what could be a grinding battle of attrition in the country’s eastern industrial heartland, top US officials pledged more help to ensure Ukraine prevails.\n\nIn a bold visit to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the American secretaries of state and defence said Washington had approved a 165 million dollar (£129 million) sale of ammunition – non-US ammo, mainly if not entirely to fit Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons – along with more than 300 million dollars (£235 million) in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said after the meeting that the West’s united support for Ukraine and pressure on Moscow are having “real results”.\n\n“When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the American support but said that “as long as Russian soldiers put a foot on Ukrainian soil, nothing is enough”.\n\nMr Kuleba warned that if western powers want Ukraine to win the war and “stop Putin in Ukraine and not to allow him to go further, deeper into Europe”, then countries need to speed up the delivery of the weapons requested by Ukraine.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to “split Russian society and to destroy Russia from within”.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv and perhaps the toppling of its government. But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'...

It has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of gas payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract.\n\nPoland also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland.\n\nPoland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, and covers about 50pc of national consumption.\n\nEarlier, data from the EU network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted, but they resumed later today.\n\nPoland\'s energy supplies are secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said today, adding that there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut.\n\nThe country can source gas via two links with Germany including a reverse flow on the Yamal pipeline, a link with Lithuania with an annual capacity of 2.5 bcm that will open on May 1 and via an interconnector with the Czech Republic for up to 1.5 bcm.\n\nAnother 5-6 bcm could be shipped via a link with Slovakia to be opened later this year.\n\nIn addition, PGNiG can import up to 6 bcm per year via the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea, and it produces more than 3 bcm of gas per year locally in Poland. In October, a pipeline allowing up to 10 bcm of gas per year to flow between Poland and Norway, will be opened.\n\nGazprom said that Poland would need to begin making payments under a new scheme as of Tuesday. It did not elaborate and did not comment on PGNiG\'s statement about the possible gas supply stoppage.\n\nOnly a few Russian gas buyers, such as Hungary and Uniper, Germany\'s main importer of Russian gas, have said it would be possible to pay for future supplies under the scheme announced by Moscow without breaching EU sanctions.\n\nThe Kremlin said Gazprom was implementing the presidential decree on enforcing payment for gas supplies in roubles.\n\nPGNiG said it would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas according to the Yamal contract and that any halt of supplies was a breach of that contract.\n\nIt added it has the right to pursue damages over breach of contract.\n\nEarlier today, Poland announced a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, that would be subject to sanctions under a law passed earlier this month allowing their assets to be frozen.

The new Russian payment system is "at odds with the agreement that is effective until the end of this year and poses considerable risks for the Bulgarian side," said the energy ministry.\n\nPoland has vowed to end imports of Russian coal, gas and oil, and is pressing other EU countries to rapidly do the same.\n\n"We are prepared for the complete cut off of Russian fossil fuels," Polish Energy Minister Anna Moskwa said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nPoland gets 46 percent of its gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia, according to Forum Energii, a think tank.\n\nPolish authorities insisted that the cutoff won\'t affect gas users.\n\n"Thanks to the implementation of the government\'s strategy of diversifying gas supply sources, PGNiG is prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on the western and southern borders and the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście," said PGNiG.\n\nMoskwa said: "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security," adding that the country\'s gas storage was 80 percent full. She said Poland will continue to buy gas on European and international markets and aims to fill its reserves to 100 percent.\n\nBulgaria, which gets 90 percent of its gas from Russia, said it has "taken steps to ensure alternative supplies of natural gas and handle the situation. Measures to restrict consumption in Bulgaria are unnecessary at this stage."\n\nPoland\'s 1996 agreement with Gazprom expires at the end of the year, and Warsaw has said it won\'t be renewed. Piotr Naimski, in charge of strategic energy infrastructure, said that Poland was already planning to end Russian gas supplies, and that Tuesday\'s decision by Gazprom "speeds that up."\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, news that gas flows from Russia to Poland showed a precipitous decline caused spot gas prices to spike. Month-ahead gas contracts on the EU benchmark TTF trading hub in the Netherlands rose from €91 per megawatt-hour to €107/MWh around 4:30 p.m. before settling back to €99/MWh.\n\nThis article has been updated to add that Gazprom will also stop shipments to Bulgaria.', 'image': 'https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26/GettyImages-1368239012.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:55'}

Schwedt, which is run by Russia\'s state-owned Rosneft, supplies the vast majority of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region with fuel.\n\nA lack of oil infrastructure linking the former West and East Germany means the country\'s eastern states would have been hit especially hard by an import stop — but a solution is close at hand, Habeck said.\n\nDealing with Schwedt "is the last task that still stands in the way of completely securing the energy supply.

The share of Russian imports is now at 40 percent, down from 55 percent before the war.

He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Le Drian “reiterated France\'s request for the free movement of civilians and free access for humanitarian aid in Mariupol, as in the rest of Ukraine”, the statement noted.\n\nFrance is delivering Caesar cannons with a range of 40 kilometres (25 miles) to Ukraine and is among 40 countries attending the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group meeting hosted by the US at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nJ’ai souhaité confirmer à mon homologue ukrainien @DmytroKuleba que la France maintiendrait son appui déterminé à l’Ukraine face à la guerre à laquelle elle est confrontée : assistance financière, sanctions, équipements de défense, lutte contre l’impunité. pic.twitter.com/9OgtKltUar — Jean-Yves Le Drian (@JY_LeDrian) April 26, 2022\n\n10:32 am: ‘Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine’: US defence chief Austin\n\nOpening the gathering of representatives of more than 40 countries at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called on members of the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group to arrive at “a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to move heaven and earth so that we can meet them”.\n\nAustin, who is chairing the meeting at the US air base, said Kyiv had done “an impressive job defending its sovereignty against Russia’s unprovoked invasion”, adding: "“Ukraine’s valor and skill will go down in military history.”\n\n“Ukraine has now beaten back the Russian military for 62 days. Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\n06:12am: Russia’s Lavrov warns of ‘real threat’ of World War III\n\nRussia has warned of the “real” threat of World War III breaking out, ahead of a Tuesday meeting between the United States and allies over sending further arms to war-torn Ukraine.\n\nMoscow’s invasion of its neighbour has triggered an outburst of support from Western nations that has seen weapons pour into the country to help it wage war against Russian troops.\n\nBut Western powers have been reluctant to deepen their involvement, for fear of sparking a conflict against nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nSpeaking to Russian news agencies, Moscow’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the risk of a World War III “is serious” and criticised Kyiv’s approach to floundering peace talks.\n\n“It is real, you can’t underestimate it,” Lavrov said.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Vedika Bahl brings us a recap of Monday’s events:\n\n01:49 Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, April 7, 2022. © Reuters\n\n04:36am: Pressure mounts on Germany’s Schroeder over Russia ties\n\nPressure was growing Monday inside Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) to expel their former leader and ex-chancellor Gerhard Schroeder over his apparent refusal to renounce his business ties with Russia.\n\nSchroeder, who is a lobbyist for Russian gas and has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, sparked fresh outrage following remarks in an interview with the New York Times published this weekend.\n\nUnrepentant over his business links with Russia, he told the newspaper: “I don’t do mea culpa. It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and REUTERS)\n\n© Studio graphique France Médias Monde\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/e48d305a-c59a-11ec-898c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/20220426-gazprom-m.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:46'}

Mr Zelensky added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nHe noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow was also on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nMr Austin said Mr Zelensky’s response to the aid was deep appreciation for what was being given but “he has the mindset that they want to win and we have the mindset that we want to help them win”.\n\nThe talks came as Russia unleashed a string of attacks against Ukrainian rail and fuel facilities on Monday, striking crucial infrastructure far from the front line of its eastern offensive, which Britain said has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, third from left, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, forth from left, meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, fourth from right, in Kyiv (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nMeanwhile, two fires were reported at oil facilities in western Russia. It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was a lightning offensive that would quickly take the capital and perhaps even topple the government in Kyiv. But the Ukrainians, aided by Western weapons, bogged down President Vladimir Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its focus is in the eastern region of the Donbas, but one senior military official says it also wants to control southern Ukraine. While both sides said the campaign in the east has begun, it has yet to gather steam.\n\nA small group of Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces, and keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor on Monday for them to leave.\n\nRussian tanks roll along a street in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Mariupol, Ukraine (Alexei Alexandrov/AP)\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nBut for now, the British Defence Ministry said that Ukrainian forces have repelled numerous assaults in the past week and “inflicted significant cost on Russian forces”. It said, so far, Russia has “yet to achieve a significant breakthrough” since shifting its focus to the Donbas.\n\nInstead, Russian missiles and war planes struck far behind the front line of that offensive on Monday.\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday, including a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nSerhiy Borzov, the governor of Ukraine’s central Vinnytsia region, said there were casualties after rocket strikes targeting “critical infrastructure”. It was not clear if that referred to the attacks on the railways.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries.\n\nA Russian news report said that another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire early Monday.\n\nIn footage later released by the Ukrainian presidency of the meeting with top US officials, Mr Blinken praised the “extraordinary courage and leadership and success that you’ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression”.\n\n“We got used to seeing you on video around the world, but it’s great, it’s good to see you in person,” he said with a smile.\n\nMr Austin said at the news conference that “the world has been inspired” by Ukraine in the war and that America will continue its support. “What you’ve done in repelling the Russians in the Battle of Kyiv is extraordinary,” he said.\n\nMr Zelensky had announced on Saturday that he would meet the US officials in Kyiv on Sunday, but Joe Biden’s administration refused to confirm that and declined to discuss details of a possible visit even though planning had been under way for more than a week.\n\nJournalists who travelled to Poland with Mr Austin and Mr Blinken were barred from reporting on the trip until it ended, were not allowed to accompany them on their overland journey into Ukraine, and were prohibited from specifying where in south-east Poland they waited for the Cabinet members to return. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon cited security concerns.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nMr Austin and Mr Blinken announced a total of 713 million dollars (£555 million) in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries; some 322 million dollars (£251 million) of that is earmarked for Kyiv. The remainder will be split among Nato members and other nations that have provided Ukraine with critical military supplies since the war with Russia began, officials said.\n\nSuch financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need.\n\nThe new money, along with the sale of 165 million dollars (£128 million) in non-US made ammunition that is compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use, takes the total amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to 3.7 billion dollars (£2.9 billion) since the invasion, officials said.\n\nUS officials said they believed the new assistance would satisfy at least some of the Ukrainians’ urgent pleas for more help. New artillery, including howitzers, continues to be delivered at a rapid pace to Ukraine’s military, which is being trained on its use in neighbouring countries, the officials said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\nOn the diplomatic front and as expected, President Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nMs Brink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council.

(Julien Warnand/Pool via Reuters)\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said that insufficient support from the bloc’s member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports can’t yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on April 25. “A final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nThose sanctions, EU officials say, are designed to minimize damage to the economies of the 27 member states while preventing the Kremlin from benefiting from lucrative income derived from energy exports, which serve as the Kremlin’s main source of foreign currency.\n\nSome experts believe those energy payments are effectively being used to finance and bolster Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine.\n\n“We are working on a sixth sanctions package and one of the issues we are considering is some form of an oil embargo,” European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told The Times of London. “When we are imposing sanctions, we need to do so in a way that maximizes pressure on Russia while minimizing collateral damage on ourselves.”\n\nSpecific details regarding the oil sanctions haven’t yet been agreed upon by EU members, but could potentially see a gradual “phasing out” of Russian oil or tariffs imposed on exports beyond a certain price cap, according to The Times of London.\n\nRussia is also one of the world’s largest producers of oil and natural gas, accounting for 17 percent of the world’s natural gas and 12 percent of its oil.\n\nIt’s also Europe’s biggest oil supplier, providing slightly more than a quarter, or 26 percent, of EU oil imports in 2020, according to data from the bloc’s statistics office Eurostat.\n\nDespite the string of sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia in recent months, Russia is expected to earn nearly $321 billion from energy exports in 2022, an increase of more than a third from 2021, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nBut while some EU states welcome a ban on Russian oil and gas, others, such as Germany—where energy prices have surged nearly 40 percent—are opposed to an immediate oil embargo, fearing the economic consequences it may have on the country, given that it currently purchases about 25 percent of its oil and 40 percent of its gas from Russia.\n\nBorrell noted on April 25 that all EU states are working to become less dependent on Russian oil and gas in light of recent events and that he believes member states will eventually be able to do so, although a clear timeline isn’t in sight.\n\n“At some point, it will happen and then Russia will feel painfully that the revenues from the oil and gas business are being lost,” Borrell said.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/09/15/2021-09-14T140818Z_1_LYNXMPEH8D0NG_RTROPTP_4_AFGHANISTAN-CONFLICT-EU-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:07'}

Belarusians are a joke — as Russia\'s creeping annexation of their country suggests. And Ukrainians are delusional fascists with no right to exist — as Russian president Vladimir Putin has openly stated.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nGermany isn\'t quite as arrogant in its views of its eastern neighbours, but neither is it as welcoming as the open-hearted German self-image would suggest.\n\nFor Berlin, Poles are difficult — failing to appreciate that they need to follow Germany\'s sage example if they want to be fully European. The pejorative term "Polnische Wirtschaft" (meaning "Polish household") is no longer in use, but the sentiment remains.\n\nBelarusians are a cypher ruled by a dictator, while Ukrainians are hopelessly corrupt and quarrelsome — or were, until Russia attacked Ukraine on 24 February and unleashed a genocidal war.\n\nMeanwhile, continued German reference to World War II as the "Russlandkrieg" (meaning "Russia War") nicely illustrates ongoing German attitudes.\n\nGermany attacked, occupied, and destroyed huge swaths of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. Belarus lost about a third of its population, Poland and Ukraine a little under a fifth, and Jews, who lived in all three countries, were subjected to almost complete annihilation in the Holocaust.\n\nBy that grim comparison, Russia actually remained largely untouched — a Russia War indeed.\n\nThe current war on Ukraine has only reinforced Russia\'s dismissive attitudes toward Poles, Belarusians, and Ukrainians.\n\nFor Moscow, the Poles are "chronic Russo-phobes," Belarusians are unreliable allies, and Ukrainians must be destroyed.\n\nThe war has also begun to change German perceptions, most notably with respect to Ukrainians. Berlin has condemned the Russian aggression, adopted severe sanctions, mothballed the Nord Stream II pipeline, and supplied Ukraine with arms.\n\nBut old habits die hard — former German chancellor Angela Merkel still refuses to admit that her policies toward Russia enabled Putin.\n\nFormer chancellor Gerhard Schröder remains an unrepentant Putin apologist and a tacit supporter of Putin\'s genocide in Ukraine.\n\nDüsseldorf\'s ex-mayor, Thomas Geisel, a social democrat like Schröder, openly questions whether Russian atrocities in Ukraine are really as serious as Ukrainians say they are, while a group of left-wingers is calling on the German government to stop delivering arms to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to German analyst Constanze Stelzenmueller: "Germany\'s self-serving Russia policy and its self-inflicted energy dependence — part wilfully naive, part deeply corrupt — found eager supporters across the political party spectrum. They emboldened the Kremlin, and they enabled Vladimir Putin\'s war."\n\nThe fact is that, just as Russia\'s distaste for its eastern neighbours includes pretty much the whole spectrum of relevant political elites, so, too, Germany\'s prioritising of Russia still remains the default position of its establishment.\n\nSo, when German finance minister Christian Lindner said on 23 April that "we must do everything in our power to help Ukraine win, but the limit of the ethical responsibility is endangering our own security and endangering the defence capability of Nato territory," one appreciates his concern for Ukraine, but one also notes that he all but openly says Germany\'s security is not dependent on Ukraine, while it is dependent on Russia.\n\nGreat power games\n\nWhy do Germany and Russia think so much alike about their neighbours in between?\n\nThe answer may lie in history and in geopolitics: both countries have been great powers since the mid-18th century and their "natural" field of contention and cooperation has been eastern Europe. It stands to reason that their mental maps of the region would be similar.\n\nUnsurprisingly, eastern Europeans often view their relationship with Germany and Russia as similar to being trapped between a hammer and an anvil.\n\nAnd with good reason — modern history is full of examples of Russo-German conflict and cooperation resulting in death and destruction for the countries in between.\n\nRussia and Prussia (the forerunner of modern Germany) colluded in three partitions of Poland in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nWilhelmine Germany and Tsarist Russia were on opposing sides in World War I, and most of the warfare took place in today\'s Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland.\n\nIn 1922, Soviet Russia and Weimar Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo, thereby recognising each other diplomatically and opening the door to economic and military cooperation that enabled Germany to rearm. The losers were, once again, the newly independent states of eastern Europe.\n\nRusso-German relations temporarily worsened after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, but collaboration resumed after a Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in 1939, resulting in the fourth Polish partition and Russian aggression against the Baltic states.\n\nTwo years later, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and, as during the previous world war, the death and destruction were centred on the peoples of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine.\n\nPost-war Germany\'s policy of Ostpolitik led to a normalisation of relations with the Communist regimes of the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany, but eastern European democratic dissidents paid the price.\n\nFormer German chancellor Willy Brandt urged the Solidarność trade union movement in Poland to stop striking in 1980, and then, in 1985, while on an official state visit, purposely refrained from meeting with Solidarność activists, clearly signalling who Bonn\'s preferred interlocutors were and where Germany\'s interests supposedly lay.\n\nThe revolutions of 1989, Germany\'s reunification in 1990, and the Soviet Union\'s collapse in 1991 paved the way for the pro-Russian and pro-Putin policies that helped make Europe dependent on Russian gas, demonised Ukraine as irredeemably corrupt, and ignored the telltale signs of Putin\'s openly aggressive stance toward Russia\'s neighbours.\n\nGermany\'s neglect of its eastern neighbours and Russia\'s hostility to them facilitated the ongoing genocidal war.\n\nNo more great powers\n\nInasmuch as eastern Europeans have suffered both when Germany and Russia have fought and when they have cooperated, the solution to this problem has to be geopolitical.\n\nIn the short run, that means Ukraine\'s victory over Russia.\n\nIn the long run, Germany must remain a middle power and Russia must be denied great-power status. De-Putinizing the regime will help, but the only durable solution for peace is for Russia to break apart.', 'image': 'https://media.euobserver.com/771665bd9becd54a78aff46c75478260-800x.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:41'}

"And now at 90 years old, I have to experience another war," she added as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier leaned toward her.\n\nNeyman is from the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, or Dnipro. Now in emergency accommodation on the eastern outskirts of Berlin, she described to the German head of state how, during World War II, her mother fled with her to the North Caucasus region and then, as the Nazi army advanced, to Kazakhstan: "We tried to survive somehow."\n\nThe hail of bombs\n\nAnother survivor is Svetlana Sabudkina, a little younger than Neyman, who was born in Kyiv. She recalled how she "got caught in the hail of bombs" as a child with her Jewish mother in the city of Kharkiv and then survived in the Ural Mountains, where "a kind-hearted Russian woman took us in."\n\nSabundkina also remembers postwar Kyiv, when German soldiers, prisoners of war, helped to rebuild the destroyed city. She shared her school lunch with one of them: "I felt sorry for him."\n\nGermany\'s Steinmeier told the group of six Holocaust survivors, who escaped Ukraine to Germany despite their advanced ages, "It breaks my heart to meet people who have had to flee a war twice in their lives and now don\'t know if they will ever be able to return home."\n\nSteinmeier listens to Neyman\'s story\n\n\'Vicious cynicism\'\n\nSteinmeier said he was deeply affected by their stories. He spoke of the "truly vicious cynicism" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had cited the baseless claim of "denazification" as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine. The stories of these survivors, Steinmeier said, are proof of Putin\'s hypocrisy.\n\nMost of them come from eastern Ukraine, specifically Dnipro, a city that has been hit by Russian missiles almost every day for weeks. Steinmeier asked whether they were all transported by bus, to which Neyman responded that it took three days in an ambulance to get to the Ukrainian-Polish border. All six of them traveled to Poland, she said, and then on to Germany.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Steinmeier spoke of his mother, who was among the many ethnic Germans expelled from Poland at the end of World War II. "We were always very aware of what it means to lose your house and home and have to start over completely again," he said.\n\nSteinmeier\'s visit was well-received by the group of elderly survivors, one of whom asked for a selfie as he left. The others thanked him when he told them: "You are welcome here, you can rely on our help."\n\nThis reception came in stark contrast to the criticism directed at the president in recent weeks, which saw Kyiv refuse his offer of an official visit after he was accused of being too sympathetic to Russia during his two terms as foreign minister. Instead of traveling to Ukraine, he has been meeting displaced Ukrainians in Germany as well as Ukraine\'s Eastern European neighbors.\n\nJewish groups organize evacuations\n\nSo far, nearly 80 Holocaust survivors have fled to Germany from Ukraine and are being housed across the country.\n\nThe "El Jana" home in eastern Berlin is still fairly new. The full-time care facility was completed shortly before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and has not yet been fully occupied. Although the building is subjected to the roar of the nearby airport, street traffic, and trains, the building is an oasis of peace for its new inhabitants.\n\nThat the dozens of survivors have made it to Germany is thanks to the commitment and help from the Jewish Claims Conference (JCC), an organization that has been providing financial and medical assistance to Holocaust survivors for years.\n\nAs soon as they realized that the Russian invasion could jeopardize that assistance, the JCC set to work organizing evacuations. At first, only a handful wanted to leave their homes, but that number gradually increased, according to Rüdiger Mahlo, the JCC\'s representative in Germany.\n\nFor those who did not want to come to Germany, evacuations were also organized for Israel or other European destinations.\n\nWatch video 00:59 Ukrainian Holocaust survivors take shelter in Germany\n\nHelping hands\n\nAccording to Mahlo, more evacuees are arriving in Germany every day, a process that required around 50 people from 15 different organizations, including the Central Welfare Office of Jews in Germany (ZWST). Those assisting on a daily basis include full-time employees of welfare associations, but also many volunteers.\n\nAid workers have also been quick to thank the support of locals, who have donated the clothes, medical equipment, and other necessities that the new arrivals need.\n\nFor the El Jana facility, this also means a demanding commitment from employees who speak Russian, according to director Laura Rose. "For them, it means twelve-hour shifts now. There must always be someone there, even at night and on weekends, who speaks Russian," she said.\n\nAlthough the survivors thanked Steinmeier for the hospitality they have received in Germany, they made it clear that their wish for the future is to return to Ukraine.\n\n"Thank you for the very warm welcome. But still, we all want to go home as soon as possible," they told the president.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you\'re here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

As Jourová indicated, banking sector sanctions are highly likely to be accepted as there are signs of a consensus among the EU countries.\n\nThe European Commission wants to widen the sanction list to include more people and entities.\n\nThe EU has already imposed five rounds of sanctions against Russia, including an embargo on Russian coal imports and a ban on Russian and Belarusian freight road operators working in the EU.', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57600345-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:24'}

"We are here to support you in any way possible."\n\nSaid Blinken: "The reason we\'re back is because of you, because of the extraordinary courage, leadership and success that you\'ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression."\n\nUS officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for Zelensky\'s government and other countries in the region. An extra $322 million in military aid for Ukraine would take total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, one official said.\n\n"It will provide support for capabilities Ukraine needs, especially the fight in the Donbas," the official said. It would also help Ukraine\'s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defence systems -- essentially NATO capable systems, the official added on condition of anonymity.\n\nWestern arms for Ukraine have infuriated Moscow. Russia\'s ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note stressing "the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice".\n\nThe meeting between the US delegation and Ukraine\'s leaders ran for three hours, or more than double the allotted time, a US official said.\n\n"In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded," Blinken told a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine\'s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nJust weeks ago, Kyiv was a frontline city under curfew and bombardment, with tens of thousands of Russian troops massing on its northern outskirts. Residents spent nights huddled in its metro stations, sheltering from artillery.\n\nToday, the nearest Russian troops are hundreds of miles away, normal life is returning to the capital, Western leaders have been visiting and countries are reopening their embassies.\n\nBlinken said US diplomats would first return to Lviv in the west and should be back in Kyiv within weeks.\n\nBut despite Ukraine having repelled the assault on Kyiv, the war is far from over. Russia has regrouped its forces and sent more troops in to eastern Ukraine. Last week it launched a massive assault there in an attempt to capture eastern provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nRAILWAY STATIONS HIT\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying. Oleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour.\n\nAll of the country was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning.\n\nAcross the border in Russia\'s Bryansk region near eastern Ukraine, authorities were battling a huge blaze at an oil depot. There was no immediate indication that the fire was connected to the war, but Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack in that area last week.\n\nBefore the US officials\' visit, Ukraine had drawn up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelensky aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe United States and NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\'s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nIn a daily update on the conflict, Britain\'s defence ministry said Russia had only made minor advances in some parts of Donbas.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nIn an emotional address at Kyiv\'s 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral to mark the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday, Zelensky said his nation would overcome "dark times".\n\nWAR GRINDS ON\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country, where the war grinds on relentlessly.\n\nSome 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\nRussia also fired rockets at two towns in the central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\nUkraine\'s general staff described Russian shelling and assaults along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steel works in Mariupol where the last Ukrainian defenders are holed up in a city destroyed during two months of Russian siege and bombardment.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special military operation", denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, Britain\'s The Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.', 'image': 'https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2022/04/25/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg/BINARY/zelensky-blinken-loyed-240422-01-smr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:55'}

"That has failed."\n\nBlinken said that Russia\'s military was underperforming and its economy was "in shambles" due to sanctions and a mass "exodus" from the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Poland before making a trip to Kyiv to discuss military assistance to Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin\'s on the scene," Blinken said, adding that US support for Ukraine will continue until Kyiv sees "final success."\n\nBlinken said that Washington was committed to the return of American diplomats to Ukraine starting next week, and that US President Joe Biden intended to nominate a new ambassador to the country.\n\nAsked about his impression of the situation on the ground, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "things are beginning to get back to normal" in Kyiv, but noted that "that\'s in stark contrast to what\'s going on" in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas — UK Defense Ministry\n\nBritain\'s defense ministry said in an intelligence update that Moscow has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, "Russia has yet to achieve a breakthrough" due to insufficient logistical and combat support, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the intelligence update, Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has exhausted Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. The ministry added that the fact that Moscow chose not to attack the Azovstal steelworks means "Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed."\n\nMoscow claimed victory in the long-besieged southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol late last week, a claim Ukraine and its Western allies have disputed.\n\nBritish intelligence said that Russia\'s defense ministry has proposed compensation for the families of deceased serviceman be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. Britain\'s defense ministry believes this "reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia\'s losses from the domestic population."\n\nWatch video 01:57 Ukraine war: Russia\'s renewed ambitions in the east\n\nRussia increased military spending to $65.9 billion in 2021\n\nWorld military expenditure surpassed the $2 trillion mark (€1.8 trillion) for the first time in 2021, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe report released on Monday shows Russia increased its military expenditure to $65.9 billion in 2021 to reach 4.1% of its GDP.\n\nIt was the third consecutive year of growth and Russia\'s military spending. Moscow was the fifth largest spender in the world, behind the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nUkraine\'s military spending has risen by 72% since Russia\'s annexation of Crimea in 2014. It spent $5.9 billion, or 3.2% of the country\'s GDP, in 2021.\n\nTotal spending in Europe in 2021 amounted to $418 billion, 3% higher than in 2020 and 19% higher than in 2012. Many European countries have contributed substantial military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, and third-largest spender Germany boosted its military aid budget to €2 billion a little over a week ago.\n\nThe United States saw a drop in expenditure in 2021 due to a drop in American spending on research and development. The US is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, having provided an additional $800 million in mid-April and another $322 million this Sunday.\n\nWatch video 02:24 US approves more military aid to Ukraine\n\nBlinken and Austin announce aid, diplomatic surge\n\nThe United States will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military financing and has approved a $165 million sale of ammunition to the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe announcement came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt was the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war.\n\nThe US officials also pledged further assistance worth $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries, with the $322 million earmarked specifically for Kyiv.\n\nThe new money brings the total amount of US military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said.\n\nThe two returned overland to Poland after their meeting.

(AP Photo/Felipe Dana) (Felipe Dana)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine — (AP) — Russia unleashed a string of attacks Monday against rail and fuel installations deep inside Ukraine, far from the front lines of Moscow’s new eastern offensive, as Russia’s top diplomat warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.”\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, moved to rush more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from the Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n“Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared, a day after he and the U.S. secretary of defense made a bold visit to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nBlinken said Washington approved a $165 million sale of ammunition — non-U.S. ammo, mainly if not entirely for Ukraine\'s Soviet-era weapons — and will also provide more than $300 million in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin took his comments further, saying that while the U.S. wants to see Ukraine remain a sovereign, democratic country, it also wants "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nAustin’s comments about weakening Russia appeared to represent a shift in broader U.S. strategic goals. Previously, the U.S. position had been that the goal of American military aid was to help Ukraine win and to defend Ukraine’s NATO neighbors against Russian threats.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said weapons supplied by Western countries “will be a legitimate target," adding that Russian forces had already targeted weapons warehouses in western Ukraine.\n\n“Everyone is reciting incantations that in no case can we allow World War III,” Lavrov said in a wide-ranging interview on Russian television. He accused Ukrainian leaders of provoking Russia by asking NATO to become involved in the conflict.\n\nBy providing weapons, NATO forces are “pouring oil on the fire,” he said, according to a transcript on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website.\n\nRegarding the possibility of a nuclear confrontation, Lavrov said: “I would not want to see these risks artificially inflated now, when the risks are rather significant.”\n\n“The danger is serious," he said. "It is real. It should not be underestimated.”\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv, the capital. But the Ukrainians, with the help of Western weapons, thwarted the push and forced President Vladimir Putin\'s troops to retreat.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is to take the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking industrial region in eastern Ukraine. While both sides say the campaign in the east is underway, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and warplanes striking far behind the front lines in an effort to thwart Ukrainian efforts to marshal supplies for the fight.\n\nFive railroad stations in central and western Ukraine were hit, and one worker was killed, said Oleksandr Kamyshin, head of Ukraine\'s state railway. The bombardment included a missile attack near Lviv, the western city close to the Polish border that has been swelled by Ukrainians fleeing the fighting elsewhere around the country.\n\nUkrainian authorities said at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk, in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. general who was NATO’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said the latest strikes against fuel depots are part of a strategy to deplete key Ukrainian war resources. The strikes against rail targets, on the other hand, are a newer tactic, he said.\n\n“I think they’re doing it for the legitimate reason of trying to interdict the flow of supplies to the front,” he said. “The illegitimate reason is they know people are trying to leave the country, and this is just another intimidation, terrorist tactic to make them not have faith and confidence in traveling on the rails.”\n\nPhillips P. O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nIn Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova that sits along the Ukrainian border, several explosions believed caused by rocket-propelled grenades hit the territory\'s Ministry of State Security. There was no immediate claim of responsibility or reports of injuries. Transnistria is a strip of land with about 470,000 people and about 1,500 Russian troops based there.\n\nMoldova\'s Foreign Ministry said “the aim of today’s incident is to create pretexts for straining the security situation in the Transnistrian region." The U.S. warned previously that Russia may launch “false-flag” attacks against its own side to create a pretext for invading other nations.\n\nLast week, Rustam Minnekayev, a Russian military commander, said the Kremlin wants full control of southern Ukraine, which he said would open the way to Transnistria.\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic southern port city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas. Over the weekend, Russian forces launched new airstrikes on the Azovstal plant to try to dislodge the holdouts.\n\nSome 1,000 civilians were also said to be taking shelter at the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor Monday for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with skepticism by Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nThe city council and mayor of Mariupol said a new mass grave has been identified about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities were trying to estimate the number of victims. It was at least the third new mass grave discovered in Russian-controlled areas near Mariupol in the last week.\n\nMariupol has been gutted by bombardment and fierce street fighting over the past two months. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, the capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said his country\'s goal is to maintain resistance and “make the occupiers’ stay in our land even more intolerable,” while Russia drains its resources.\n\nA top Ukrainian official cast doubt on the prospect of further talks between the two countries. Recent sessions in Istanbul ended without resolution earlier this month.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview that any negotiations other than talks between Zelenskyy and Putin would bring little resolution.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective."\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Yuras Karmanau and Jon Gambrell in Lviv, Ukraine, and AP staff around the world contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\'s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense. Speaking at the event, Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense, told reporters that "we have to move at the speed of war."\n\nAustin said the US was determined to make better use of the US European Command\'s coordination mechanism and would extend the forum for Ukraine\'s defense into a monthly contact group.\n\n"We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and make it less able to do that," Austin said.\n\nAustin went on to express sharp criticism of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who warned on Monday that World War III might be looming.\n\n"You\'ve heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful," Austin said. "Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence. The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing. Mantoo added that Syria has the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled the country.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nUN doubles Ukraine aid appeal to $2.25 billion\n\nThe United Nations\' humanitarian agency (UN OCHA) said that it has been forced to double its aid appeal to $2.25 billion (€2.11 billion) as the humanitarian situation in the country worsens.\n\n"Over $2.25 billion is now required for needs inside Ukraine, more than double of the amount requested ($1.1 billion) when we launched the appeal on 1 March, a few days after the war began," the UN OCHA said in a statement.\n\nUS, allies will \'move heaven and Earth\' to meet Ukrainian security requirements — Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the aim of the conference at the air base in Ramstein, Germany was to "help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion," as well as to "build up Ukraine\'s defenses for tomorrow\'s challenges."\n\nAustin said that he discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Kyiv\'s "changing requirements" as Russia focuses on Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region. Austin said that the US and its allies will "keep moving heaven and Earth" to meet Ukraine\'s security requirements.\n\n"Ukraine needs our help to win today, and they will still need our help when the war is over," Austin said. He added that the US and its allies have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine\'s defense since the start of the war.\n\nThe defense secretary said that Ukraine "has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia\'s unprovoked invasion."\n\nAustin said that Ukraine\'s allies had provided assistance at "record speed," adding that "Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly."\n\nReferring to Russian troop withdrawal from areas around Ukraine\'s capital, Austin said that the war was "entering a new phase" following what he called "Russia\'s defeat at the battle of Kyiv."\n\n"Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man," Austin said, alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens."\n\nWatch video 01:06 Austin: \'We\'re here to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion\'\n\nExplosions hit radio facility in Russia-backed Trans-Dniester\n\nPolice in the breakaway Moldovan region of Trans-Dniester said that two explosions knocked two powerful antennas out of service in a radio facility close to Ukrainian border. The interior ministry of the region said those antennas were re-broadcasting Russian radio.\n\nThe incident occurred in a small town of Maiac about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the regional capital Tiraspol and roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine.

The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move.

Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield.

How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city.

Click here for updates from April 24.\n\nMariupol Officials Say New Mass Grave Found\n\nOfficials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new mass grave has been identified north of the city.\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) north of Mariupol.\n\nSatellite photos released over the past several days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nMariupol has been decimated by fierce fighting over the past two months. The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk. The Russian report said oil storage tanks at the facility caught fire around 2 a.m. local time.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires show a burning fire at coordinates that correspond to a Rosneft facility some 70 miles north of the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, adviser to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was cited by the Ukrainian news agency Unian as saying that people who live near the burning oil depot were being evacuated.\n\nMoscow has previously blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s top security officials have denied that Kyiv was behind an earlier airstrike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 35 miles from the border.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin Meet With Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country’s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nIt came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia’s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n“Yes, they’re meeting with the president. Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:40'}

Then (in 2009) Boyko Borissov had promised diversification, which never took place. The words of Putin and Gazprom are not worth it. Not only that - Borisov built them a gas pipeline that bypassed Ukraine for BGN 3 billion (paid by Bulgarian taxpayers). Bulgaria will cope, there will be gas.

Credit: Wikipedia - Government.ru Novy Urengoy CC BY 3.0\n\nPoland and Bulgaria will both see their gas supplies turned off by Gazprom in Russia\n\n\n\nAs of today, Wednesday, April 27, Moscow has stopped Russian gas from flowing through the pipes of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline that supplies Poland, and also Germany. In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

It was not clear what caused the blazes.\n\nAs both sides in the war brace for what could be a grinding battle of attrition in the country’s eastern industrial heartland, top US officials pledged more help to ensure Ukraine prevails.\n\nIn a bold visit to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the American secretaries of state and defence said Washington had approved a 165 million dollar (£129 million) sale of ammunition – non-US ammo, mainly if not entirely to fit Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons – along with more than 300 million dollars (£235 million) in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said after the meeting that the West’s united support for Ukraine and pressure on Moscow are having “real results”.\n\n“When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the American support but said that “as long as Russian soldiers put a foot on Ukrainian soil, nothing is enough”.\n\nMr Kuleba warned that if western powers want Ukraine to win the war and “stop Putin in Ukraine and not to allow him to go further, deeper into Europe”, then countries need to speed up the delivery of the weapons requested by Ukraine.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to “split Russian society and to destroy Russia from within”.\n\nWhen Russia invaded on February 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv and perhaps the toppling of its government. But the Ukrainians, with the help of western weapons, bogged down Mr Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the east. While both sides said the campaign in the east is under way, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective”, and Russia had lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and more than 60 helicopters and fighter planes.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the plant in a bid to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters. Some 1,000 civilians were also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with scepticism by Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and war planes striking far behind the front lines, in an apparent bid to slow the movement of Ukrainian supplies towards the east and disrupt the flow of fuel needed by the country’s forces.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday. That included a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central region of Vynnytsia.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early on Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze. Photos showed a huge, churning plume of thick smoke.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries. The ministry said the blaze damaged a depot containing diesel fuel. It said the region has enough diesel for 15 days.\n\nIt was not clear if the depot was part of the pipeline infrastructure, but Polish pipelines operator PERN said deliveries to Poland have not been affected.\n\nA Russian news report said another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire on Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nLast month, two Ukrainian helicopter gunships hit an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod region, close to the Ukrainian border.\n\nIn a video address on Monday, Mr Zelensky described his meeting with Mr Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging and, importantly, effective”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army”.\n\nWith Russia’s shift in focus towards the Donbas, Mr Zelensky is now focused on more heavy weaponry, such as tanks and artillery.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\n“We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory,” Mr Austin said. “We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nIn a boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term on Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to loosen France’s ties to the European Union and Nato.\n\nMs Le Pen had spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.', 'image': 'https://www.dumbartonreporter.co.uk/resources/images/13713011/', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:05'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war. Since the beginning of April, just under 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, after some 3.4 million left in March.\n\nThe UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an additional 218,000 citizens of third countries—largely students and migrant workers—have also fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began.\n\nWomen and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.\n\nBeyond the refugees, the IOM estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Ukrainian children have had to flee their homes, including those who remain in the country.\n\n2:45pm: Visit by top US officials sign of improved security situation in Kyiv\n\nA visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday is a strong sign that the security situation in Ukraine\'s capital has improved.

"The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win," he said.

The move to cut off supplies follows sanctions imposed by Warsaw against Russian individuals and companies.\n\nRead More\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that countries he terms "unfriendly" agree to implement a scheme under which they would open accounts at Gazprombank and make payments for Russian gas imports in euros or dollars that would be converted into roubles.\n\nHe had threatened to cut gas supplies in case the demands would not be fully met.\n\nPoland, a staunch political opponent of Moscow, has a gas deal with Russia which expires at the end of this year. It has repeatedly said it would not comply with the new scheme of gas payments. It has also said it would not extend the contract.\n\nPoland also did not extend its gas transit deal with Gazprom in 2020. Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland.\n\nPoland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, and covers about 50pc of national consumption.\n\nEarlier, data from the EU network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted, but they resumed later today.\n\nPoland\'s energy supplies are secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said today, adding that there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut.\n\nThe country can source gas via two links with Germany including a reverse flow on the Yamal pipeline, a link with Lithuania with an annual capacity of 2.5 bcm that will open on May 1 and via an interconnector with the Czech Republic for up to 1.5 bcm.\n\nAnother 5-6 bcm could be shipped via a link with Slovakia to be opened later this year.\n\nIn addition, PGNiG can import up to 6 bcm per year via the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea, and it produces more than 3 bcm of gas per year locally in Poland. In October, a pipeline allowing up to 10 bcm of gas per year to flow between Poland and Norway, will be opened.\n\nGazprom said that Poland would need to begin making payments under a new scheme as of Tuesday. It did not elaborate and did not comment on PGNiG\'s statement about the possible gas supply stoppage.\n\nOnly a few Russian gas buyers, such as Hungary and Uniper, Germany\'s main importer of Russian gas, have said it would be possible to pay for future supplies under the scheme announced by Moscow without breaching EU sanctions.\n\nThe Kremlin said Gazprom was implementing the presidential decree on enforcing payment for gas supplies in roubles.\n\nPGNiG said it would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas according to the Yamal contract and that any halt of supplies was a breach of that contract.\n\nIt added it has the right to pursue damages over breach of contract.\n\nEarlier today, Poland announced a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, that would be subject to sanctions under a law passed earlier this month allowing their assets to be frozen.

Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw’s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nThe European Union is preparing “smart sanctions” against Russian oil imports, possibly some form of oil embargo, The Times reported on Monday, citing the European Commission’s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\nBrussels prepares to hit Russia with 'smart sanctions' on oil imports The European Union is preparing “smart sanctions” against Russian oil imports, The Times reported on Monday (25 April), citing the European Commission’s executive vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdoğan said after talks by phone with Zelenskyy that Ankara was ready to assist in negotiations with Russia. Zelenskyy said he discussed with Erdoğan the need for the immediate evacuation of civilians from the southern city of Mariupol, the site of the biggest battle of the conflict.\n\nRussian forces on Sunday again attempted to storm the Azovstal steel plant, the main remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said, adding that more than 1,000 civilians are also sheltering there.\n\nUkraine on Sunday proposed a “special” round of negotiations with Russia to discuss the fate of the civilians and Ukrainian troops still trapped in the city, though Moscow has yet to respond publicly.\n\nThe aim of the talks would be to establish an immediate ceasefire in Mariupol, “multi-day” humanitarian corridors, and the freeing or swapping of Ukrainian fighters trapped in the plant, Ukraine’s Arestovych said.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said Russia was hitting the plant with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical… we have very many wounded men, (some) are dying … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said.\n\nMoscow has previously declared victory in the city and said it did not need to take the plant.\n\nCapturing Mariupol would link pro-Russian separatists who control parts of the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk that make up the Donbas with the southern Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Moscow seized in 2014.\n\nUkraine estimates tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in Mariupol and says 100,000 civilians are still in the city. The United Nations and Red Cross say the civilian toll is at least in the thousands.\n\n(Edited by Georgi Gotev)", 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Easter-cake-in-helmet-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:03'}

But Johnson insisted that the West did not need to make concessions despite the nuclear threat.\n\n“People say we have to make a concession, we have to worry about what Putin might do because of the risk of his defeat,” Johnson said. “I think he has got a lot of space, he has got a lot of room for manoeuvre.”\n\n10:02pm: Gazprom has informed Bulgaria, Poland of halt to gas supplies from Wednesday\n\nRussia’s Gazprom has informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it will halt gas supplies as of Wednesday, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ministry said that along with state gas companies it has taken steps to find alternative arrangements for the supply of natural gas and to deal with the situation.\n\nIt said for the time being no restrictions in the gas consumption in the Balkan country which meets over 90 percent of its gas needs with Gazprom’s imports, were required.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Polish officials had said Russia is suspending natural gas deliveries to Poland beginning Wednesday morning after that country refused a demand to pay for its supplies in Russian rubles\n\nPoland’s state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Russian gas giant Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop on Wednesday.\n\nPolish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources. She said the country has been effectively independent when it comes to Russian gas for some time.\n\n“There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes,” Moskwa tweeted.\n\n9:39pm IAEA says it has agreed with Ukraine to help repair damage to Chernobyl\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday said he had agreed with Ukraine to help repair the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant after it was occupied by Russian troops.\n\n“It is visible that there is damage and we are assessing that,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told a news conference in Kyiv after visiting the station.\n\nThirty-six years ago, on April 26, 1986, an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction destroyed the reactor in an accident that was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities.\n\nRussian troops took over the site on February 24 of this year, the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, taking Ukrainian soldiers prisoner and detaining civilian staff.\n\nThe occupation lasted until the end of March and raised global fears of nuclear leaks.\n\nRussia’s temporary takeover of the Chernobyl site was “very, very dangerous” and raised radiation levels but they have now returned to “normal”, Grossi said during his visit there earlier on Tuesday.\n\n9:17pm: US warns not to \'escalate tensions\' after Moldova region blasts\n\nThe United States on Tuesday warned against attempts to "escalate tensions" after a series of blasts in a Russian-backed separatist region of Moldova, which borders Ukraine.\n\nWhile stopping short of backing Kyiv\'s contention that Russia was responsible for the incidents in Transnistria, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters: "We do remain concerned about any potential attempts to escalate tensions."\n\n"We reiterate the Moldovan government\'s call for calm in response to these incidents and we fully support Moldova\'s territorial integrity and sovereignty," Price said.\n\nThe mysterious recent blasts which targeted the state security ministry, a radio tower and military unit came days after a senior Russian commander claimed Russian speakers in Moldova were being oppressed.\n\nRussian forces have been positioned in Transnistria for three decades after the predominantly Russian-speaking region seceded from the former Soviet republic, a decision not recognized internationally.\n\n9:04pm: US says talk of Lavrov\'s comments on nuclear escalation is irresponsible\n\nThe US State Department on Tuesday criticized Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s comments about the potential of a nuclear war, saying loose talk about nuclear escalation was the "height of irresponsibility."\n\nLavrov warned the West on Monday not to underestimate the elevated risks of nuclear conflict over Ukraine and said he viewed NATO as being "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia by supplying Kyiv with weaponry.\n\n8:10pm: Putin agrees to United Nations, Red Cross help to evacuate civilians from Azovstal plant, UN says\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin agreed “in principle” to UN and International Committee for the Red Cross involvement in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in Ukraine’s Mariupol, the United Nations said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n“Follow-on discussions will be had with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Russian Defence Ministry,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement after Putin met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Moscow.\n\n7:44pm: Putin tells UN chief he still has \'hope\' for Ukraine talks\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told the visiting UN chief Tuesday that he still had hope for negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject (talks)," Putin told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was visiting Moscow, in televised remarks.\n\nSitting across from Guterres at a long table at the Kremlin, Putin said efforts at talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, speaks to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting in the Kremlin, in Moscow, Russia, on April 26, 2022. © Vladimir Astapkovich, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nPutin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia\'s military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.\n\nGuterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (see 2:02pm, below) for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\n6:45pm: Blinken says Putin not \'serious\' about Ukraine diplomacy\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the Ukraine war, despite a series of international efforts.\n\n“We’ve seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: “Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table.”\n\nBlinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlinken hailed what he saw on the trip and said that the US was speeding up arms deliveries, with the process now often taking only 72 hours after Ukraine sends requests.\n\n6:10pm: Germany confirms plans to send Ukraine tanks, in policy shift\n\nGermany said Tuesday it would send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a clear switch in Berlin’s cautious policy on military backing for Kyiv that was welcomed by the United States.\n\nThe government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the US Ramstein airbase.\n\nThe move comes after heavy criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to Ukraine, despite announcing a “turning point” in German defence policy in response to Russia’s invasion.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the pledge to send “some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems”, the English name for the weapons, was “especially welcome”.\n\n5:19pm: US Defence Secretary says US, allies to meet monthly on arming Ukraine\n\nThe United States and its allies will meet once a month to discuss Ukraine\'s defence needs to battle invading Russian troops, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.\n\n"Today\'s gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine\'s self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\n4:53pm: FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg on the fallout over blasts in Transnistria, Moldova\n\n02:48 © FRANCE 24\n\n4:08pm: Putin, Erdogan discuss humanitarian corridors in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow’s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin statement, the leaders in a phone call talked about “efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors”.\n\nThis came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.\n\nThe Kremlin said Erdogan asked Putin about the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe Russian leader told him that “the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there”.\n\n3:09pm: Nearly 5.3 million flee Ukraine war as refugees, up more than 32,000 since Monday\n\nNearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.\n\nIn total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 32,753 over Monday\'s figure.\n\nWhile the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday (see 11:31am, below) that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.\n\n2:02 pm: Guterres says Russia, UN have \'very different\' views of events in Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had "very frank" discussions with Lavrov. He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol.

Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and REUTERS)\n\n© Studio graphique France Médias Monde\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/e48d305a-c59a-11ec-898c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/20220426-gazprom-m.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:46'}

But the Ukrainians, aided by Western weapons, bogged down President Vladimir Putin’s troops and thwarted their push to Kyiv.\n\nMoscow now says its focus is in the eastern region of the Donbas, but one senior military official says it also wants to control southern Ukraine. While both sides said the campaign in the east has begun, it has yet to gather steam.\n\nA small group of Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces, and keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh air strikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor on Monday for them to leave.\n\nRussian tanks roll along a street in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces in Mariupol, Ukraine (Alexei Alexandrov/AP)\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its strategic location on the Sea of Azov. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nBut for now, the British Defence Ministry said that Ukrainian forces have repelled numerous assaults in the past week and “inflicted significant cost on Russian forces”. It said, so far, Russia has “yet to achieve a significant breakthrough” since shifting its focus to the Donbas.\n\nInstead, Russian missiles and war planes struck far behind the front line of that offensive on Monday.\n\nOleksandr Kamyshin, the head of the state-run Ukrainian Railways, said five railway facilities in central and western Ukraine were hit on Monday, including a missile attack near the western city of Lviv.\n\nSerhiy Borzov, the governor of Ukraine’s central Vinnytsia region, said there were casualties after rocket strikes targeting “critical infrastructure”. It was not clear if that referred to the attacks on the railways.\n\nSmoke rises from oil storage facilities hit by fire in Bryansk, Russia (Anonymous source via AP)\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a major fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot in a Russian city about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said. No cause was given for the blaze.\n\nThe oil depot in Bryansk is owned by a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the Druzhba pipeline that carries crude west to other European countries.\n\nA Russian news report said that another oil storage facility in Bryansk also caught fire early Monday.\n\nIn footage later released by the Ukrainian presidency of the meeting with top US officials, Mr Blinken praised the “extraordinary courage and leadership and success that you’ve had in pushing back this horrific Russian aggression”.\n\n“We got used to seeing you on video around the world, but it’s great, it’s good to see you in person,” he said with a smile.\n\nMr Austin said at the news conference that “the world has been inspired” by Ukraine in the war and that America will continue its support. “What you’ve done in repelling the Russians in the Battle of Kyiv is extraordinary,” he said.\n\nMr Zelensky had announced on Saturday that he would meet the US officials in Kyiv on Sunday, but Joe Biden’s administration refused to confirm that and declined to discuss details of a possible visit even though planning had been under way for more than a week.\n\nJournalists who travelled to Poland with Mr Austin and Mr Blinken were barred from reporting on the trip until it ended, were not allowed to accompany them on their overland journey into Ukraine, and were prohibited from specifying where in south-east Poland they waited for the Cabinet members to return. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon cited security concerns.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr had urged the Americans not to go empty-handed (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)\n\nMr Austin and Mr Blinken announced a total of 713 million dollars (£555 million) in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries; some 322 million dollars (£251 million) of that is earmarked for Kyiv. The remainder will be split among Nato members and other nations that have provided Ukraine with critical military supplies since the war with Russia began, officials said.\n\nSuch financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need.\n\nThe new money, along with the sale of 165 million dollars (£128 million) in non-US made ammunition that is compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use, takes the total amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to 3.7 billion dollars (£2.9 billion) since the invasion, officials said.\n\nUS officials said they believed the new assistance would satisfy at least some of the Ukrainians’ urgent pleas for more help. New artillery, including howitzers, continues to be delivered at a rapid pace to Ukraine’s military, which is being trained on its use in neighbouring countries, the officials said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken boards a plane to return to Washington (Alex Brandon/Pool/AP)\n\nOn the diplomatic front and as expected, President Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nMs Brink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia.

And Ukrainians are delusional fascists with no right to exist — as Russian president Vladimir Putin has openly stated.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nGermany isn\'t quite as arrogant in its views of its eastern neighbours, but neither is it as welcoming as the open-hearted German self-image would suggest.\n\nFor Berlin, Poles are difficult — failing to appreciate that they need to follow Germany\'s sage example if they want to be fully European. The pejorative term "Polnische Wirtschaft" (meaning "Polish household") is no longer in use, but the sentiment remains.\n\nBelarusians are a cypher ruled by a dictator, while Ukrainians are hopelessly corrupt and quarrelsome — or were, until Russia attacked Ukraine on 24 February and unleashed a genocidal war.\n\nMeanwhile, continued German reference to World War II as the "Russlandkrieg" (meaning "Russia War") nicely illustrates ongoing German attitudes.\n\nGermany attacked, occupied, and destroyed huge swaths of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. Belarus lost about a third of its population, Poland and Ukraine a little under a fifth, and Jews, who lived in all three countries, were subjected to almost complete annihilation in the Holocaust.\n\nBy that grim comparison, Russia actually remained largely untouched — a Russia War indeed.\n\nThe current war on Ukraine has only reinforced Russia\'s dismissive attitudes toward Poles, Belarusians, and Ukrainians.\n\nFor Moscow, the Poles are "chronic Russo-phobes," Belarusians are unreliable allies, and Ukrainians must be destroyed.\n\nThe war has also begun to change German perceptions, most notably with respect to Ukrainians. Berlin has condemned the Russian aggression, adopted severe sanctions, mothballed the Nord Stream II pipeline, and supplied Ukraine with arms.\n\nBut old habits die hard — former German chancellor Angela Merkel still refuses to admit that her policies toward Russia enabled Putin.\n\nFormer chancellor Gerhard Schröder remains an unrepentant Putin apologist and a tacit supporter of Putin\'s genocide in Ukraine.\n\nDüsseldorf\'s ex-mayor, Thomas Geisel, a social democrat like Schröder, openly questions whether Russian atrocities in Ukraine are really as serious as Ukrainians say they are, while a group of left-wingers is calling on the German government to stop delivering arms to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to German analyst Constanze Stelzenmueller: "Germany\'s self-serving Russia policy and its self-inflicted energy dependence — part wilfully naive, part deeply corrupt — found eager supporters across the political party spectrum. They emboldened the Kremlin, and they enabled Vladimir Putin\'s war."\n\nThe fact is that, just as Russia\'s distaste for its eastern neighbours includes pretty much the whole spectrum of relevant political elites, so, too, Germany\'s prioritising of Russia still remains the default position of its establishment.\n\nSo, when German finance minister Christian Lindner said on 23 April that "we must do everything in our power to help Ukraine win, but the limit of the ethical responsibility is endangering our own security and endangering the defence capability of Nato territory," one appreciates his concern for Ukraine, but one also notes that he all but openly says Germany\'s security is not dependent on Ukraine, while it is dependent on Russia.\n\nGreat power games\n\nWhy do Germany and Russia think so much alike about their neighbours in between?\n\nThe answer may lie in history and in geopolitics: both countries have been great powers since the mid-18th century and their "natural" field of contention and cooperation has been eastern Europe. It stands to reason that their mental maps of the region would be similar.\n\nUnsurprisingly, eastern Europeans often view their relationship with Germany and Russia as similar to being trapped between a hammer and an anvil.\n\nAnd with good reason — modern history is full of examples of Russo-German conflict and cooperation resulting in death and destruction for the countries in between.\n\nRussia and Prussia (the forerunner of modern Germany) colluded in three partitions of Poland in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nWilhelmine Germany and Tsarist Russia were on opposing sides in World War I, and most of the warfare took place in today\'s Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland.\n\nIn 1922, Soviet Russia and Weimar Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo, thereby recognising each other diplomatically and opening the door to economic and military cooperation that enabled Germany to rearm. The losers were, once again, the newly independent states of eastern Europe.\n\nRusso-German relations temporarily worsened after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, but collaboration resumed after a Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in 1939, resulting in the fourth Polish partition and Russian aggression against the Baltic states.\n\nTwo years later, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and, as during the previous world war, the death and destruction were centred on the peoples of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine.\n\nPost-war Germany\'s policy of Ostpolitik led to a normalisation of relations with the Communist regimes of the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany, but eastern European democratic dissidents paid the price.\n\nFormer German chancellor Willy Brandt urged the Solidarność trade union movement in Poland to stop striking in 1980, and then, in 1985, while on an official state visit, purposely refrained from meeting with Solidarność activists, clearly signalling who Bonn\'s preferred interlocutors were and where Germany\'s interests supposedly lay.\n\nThe revolutions of 1989, Germany\'s reunification in 1990, and the Soviet Union\'s collapse in 1991 paved the way for the pro-Russian and pro-Putin policies that helped make Europe dependent on Russian gas, demonised Ukraine as irredeemably corrupt, and ignored the telltale signs of Putin\'s openly aggressive stance toward Russia\'s neighbours.\n\nGermany\'s neglect of its eastern neighbours and Russia\'s hostility to them facilitated the ongoing genocidal war.\n\nNo more great powers\n\nInasmuch as eastern Europeans have suffered both when Germany and Russia have fought and when they have cooperated, the solution to this problem has to be geopolitical.\n\nIn the short run, that means Ukraine\'s victory over Russia.\n\nIn the long run, Germany must remain a middle power and Russia must be denied great-power status. De-Putinizing the regime will help, but the only durable solution for peace is for Russia to break apart.', 'image': 'https://media.euobserver.com/771665bd9becd54a78aff46c75478260-800x.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:41'}

He spoke of the "truly vicious cynicism" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had cited the baseless claim of "denazification" as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine. The stories of these survivors, Steinmeier said, are proof of Putin\'s hypocrisy.\n\nMost of them come from eastern Ukraine, specifically Dnipro, a city that has been hit by Russian missiles almost every day for weeks. Steinmeier asked whether they were all transported by bus, to which Neyman responded that it took three days in an ambulance to get to the Ukrainian-Polish border. All six of them traveled to Poland, she said, and then on to Germany.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Steinmeier spoke of his mother, who was among the many ethnic Germans expelled from Poland at the end of World War II. "We were always very aware of what it means to lose your house and home and have to start over completely again," he said.\n\nSteinmeier\'s visit was well-received by the group of elderly survivors, one of whom asked for a selfie as he left. The others thanked him when he told them: "You are welcome here, you can rely on our help."\n\nThis reception came in stark contrast to the criticism directed at the president in recent weeks, which saw Kyiv refuse his offer of an official visit after he was accused of being too sympathetic to Russia during his two terms as foreign minister. Instead of traveling to Ukraine, he has been meeting displaced Ukrainians in Germany as well as Ukraine\'s Eastern European neighbors.\n\nJewish groups organize evacuations\n\nSo far, nearly 80 Holocaust survivors have fled to Germany from Ukraine and are being housed across the country.\n\nThe "El Jana" home in eastern Berlin is still fairly new. The full-time care facility was completed shortly before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and has not yet been fully occupied. Although the building is subjected to the roar of the nearby airport, street traffic, and trains, the building is an oasis of peace for its new inhabitants.\n\nThat the dozens of survivors have made it to Germany is thanks to the commitment and help from the Jewish Claims Conference (JCC), an organization that has been providing financial and medical assistance to Holocaust survivors for years.\n\nAs soon as they realized that the Russian invasion could jeopardize that assistance, the JCC set to work organizing evacuations. At first, only a handful wanted to leave their homes, but that number gradually increased, according to Rüdiger Mahlo, the JCC\'s representative in Germany.\n\nFor those who did not want to come to Germany, evacuations were also organized for Israel or other European destinations.\n\nWatch video 00:59 Ukrainian Holocaust survivors take shelter in Germany\n\nHelping hands\n\nAccording to Mahlo, more evacuees are arriving in Germany every day, a process that required around 50 people from 15 different organizations, including the Central Welfare Office of Jews in Germany (ZWST). Those assisting on a daily basis include full-time employees of welfare associations, but also many volunteers.\n\nAid workers have also been quick to thank the support of locals, who have donated the clothes, medical equipment, and other necessities that the new arrivals need.\n\nFor the El Jana facility, this also means a demanding commitment from employees who speak Russian, according to director Laura Rose. "For them, it means twelve-hour shifts now. There must always be someone there, even at night and on weekends, who speaks Russian," she said.\n\nAlthough the survivors thanked Steinmeier for the hospitality they have received in Germany, they made it clear that their wish for the future is to return to Ukraine.\n\n"Thank you for the very warm welcome. But still, we all want to go home as soon as possible," they told the president.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you\'re here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\'s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nIn a daily update on the conflict, Britain\'s defence ministry said Russia had only made minor advances in some parts of Donbas.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nIn an emotional address at Kyiv\'s 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral to mark the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday, Zelensky said his nation would overcome "dark times".\n\nWAR GRINDS ON\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country, where the war grinds on relentlessly.\n\nSome 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said.

How can it be otherwise?" Lavrov said. "NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war," he added.\n\nIn another interview late Monday, Lavrov vowed peace talks with Ukraine would continue even as he warned of a "real" danger of the conflict in Ukraine escalating into a third world war.\n\n"The danger is serious, it is real, you can\'t underestimate it," Lavrov told the Interfax news agency.\n\nThe foreign minister also told Russian state television that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nWhen asked if the current situation in Ukraine was comparable to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Lavrov said that "back then there were actually only a few rules, written rules."\n\nHowever, Lavrov said that during that time, there were "clear rules of conduct" and a channel of communication between the leaders of the US and Soviet Union that doesn\'t exist today.\n\nThe foreign minister also criticized Ukraine\'s approach to negotiations following Russia\'s invasion of the country on February 24. Lavrov accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of "pretending" to negotiate.\n\nHe told Russian news agencies the content of peace talks would depend on the military situation and added, "Good will has its limits.

Many European countries have contributed substantial military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, and third-largest spender Germany boosted its military aid budget to €2 billion a little over a week ago.\n\nThe United States saw a drop in expenditure in 2021 due to a drop in American spending on research and development. The US is the largest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, having provided an additional $800 million in mid-April and another $322 million this Sunday.\n\nWatch video 02:24 US approves more military aid to Ukraine\n\nBlinken and Austin announce aid, diplomatic surge\n\nThe United States will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military financing and has approved a $165 million sale of ammunition to the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe announcement came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday.\n\nIt was the highest-level visit by an American delegation since the start of the war.\n\nThe US officials also pledged further assistance worth $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries, with the $322 million earmarked specifically for Kyiv.\n\nThe new money brings the total amount of US military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said.\n\nThe two returned overland to Poland after their meeting. While Blinken was returning to Washington, Austin would head to Ramstein in Germany, for a meeting Tuesday of NATO defense ministers and other donor countries.\n\nWatch video 03:37 Zelenskyy hopes US Foreign and Defense Ministers bring promises of weapons: DW\'s Rebecca Ritter\n\nFire at Russian oil depot north of Ukrainian border\n\nA large fire was reported at an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk.

Bryansk is located about 380 kilometers (236 miles) southwest of Moscow.\n\nThe city is the administrative center of the Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials on Thursday had said Ukrainian helicopters hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the Bryansk region.\n\nThere was no immediate indication the fire on Monday at the oil storage facility was related to the war in Ukraine.\n\nEU considering \'smart sanctions\' against Russian oil\n\nThe European Union is preparing "smart sanctions" against Russian oil imports, the UK newspaper The Times reported.\n\nQuoting the European Commission\'s executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis, the paper reported that the precise details of the oil sanctions had not yet been agreed but could include a gradual phasing-out of Russian oil or imposing tariffs on imports beyond a certain price cap.\n\n"We are working on a sixth sanctions package, and one of the issues we are considering is some form of an oil embargo. When we are imposing sanctions, we need to do so in a way that maximizes pressure on Russia while minimizing collateral damage on ourselves," Dombrovskis said.\n\nEurope spends around $450 million (€417 million) per day on Russian crude oil and refined products.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand show support for Ukraine at ANZAC Day commemorations\n\nThe leaders of Australia and New Zealand used their annual speeches on Anzac Day to show support for Ukraine.\n\nAnzac Day marks the anniversary of Australian and New Zealand soldiers landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in 1915 during World War I but is now used to commemorate troops from all conflicts.\n\n"The invasion of Ukraine is a senseless act of war, one that is taking the lives of innocent people.

(AP Photo/Felipe Dana) (Felipe Dana)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine — (AP) — Russia unleashed a string of attacks Monday against rail and fuel installations deep inside Ukraine, far from the front lines of Moscow’s new eastern offensive, as Russia’s top diplomat warned against provoking World War III and said the threat of a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.”\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, moved to rush more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from the Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n“Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared, a day after he and the U.S. secretary of defense made a bold visit to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nBlinken said Washington approved a $165 million sale of ammunition — non-U.S. ammo, mainly if not entirely for Ukraine\'s Soviet-era weapons — and will also provide more than $300 million in financing to buy more supplies.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin took his comments further, saying that while the U.S. wants to see Ukraine remain a sovereign, democratic country, it also wants "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”\n\nAustin’s comments about weakening Russia appeared to represent a shift in broader U.S. strategic goals. Previously, the U.S. position had been that the goal of American military aid was to help Ukraine win and to defend Ukraine’s NATO neighbors against Russian threats.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said weapons supplied by Western countries “will be a legitimate target," adding that Russian forces had already targeted weapons warehouses in western Ukraine.\n\n“Everyone is reciting incantations that in no case can we allow World War III,” Lavrov said in a wide-ranging interview on Russian television. He accused Ukrainian leaders of provoking Russia by asking NATO to become involved in the conflict.\n\nBy providing weapons, NATO forces are “pouring oil on the fire,” he said, according to a transcript on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website.\n\nRegarding the possibility of a nuclear confrontation, Lavrov said: “I would not want to see these risks artificially inflated now, when the risks are rather significant.”\n\n“The danger is serious," he said. "It is real. It should not be underestimated.”\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, its apparent goal was the lightning capture of Kyiv, the capital. But the Ukrainians, with the help of Western weapons, thwarted the push and forced President Vladimir Putin\'s troops to retreat.\n\nMoscow now says its goal is to take the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking industrial region in eastern Ukraine. While both sides say the campaign in the east is underway, Russia has yet to mount an all-out ground offensive and has not achieved any major breakthroughs.\n\nOn Monday, Russia focused its firepower elsewhere, with missiles and warplanes striking far behind the front lines in an effort to thwart Ukrainian efforts to marshal supplies for the fight.\n\nFive railroad stations in central and western Ukraine were hit, and one worker was killed, said Oleksandr Kamyshin, head of Ukraine\'s state railway. The bombardment included a missile attack near Lviv, the western city close to the Polish border that has been swelled by Ukrainians fleeing the fighting elsewhere around the country.\n\nUkrainian authorities said at least five people were killed by Russian strikes in the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nRussia also destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk, in central Ukraine, along with fuel depots there, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. In all, Russian warplanes destroyed 56 Ukrainian targets overnight, he said.\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. general who was NATO’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said the latest strikes against fuel depots are part of a strategy to deplete key Ukrainian war resources. The strikes against rail targets, on the other hand, are a newer tactic, he said.\n\n“I think they’re doing it for the legitimate reason of trying to interdict the flow of supplies to the front,” he said. “The illegitimate reason is they know people are trying to leave the country, and this is just another intimidation, terrorist tactic to make them not have faith and confidence in traveling on the rails.”\n\nPhillips P. O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said the war is, for now, settling into a campaign of incremental battlefield losses and gains.\n\n“The two sides are sort of every day weakening each other,” he said. “So it’s a question of what can you bring in that’s new” and “what can you destroy on the other side.”\n\nIn Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova that sits along the Ukrainian border, several explosions believed caused by rocket-propelled grenades hit the territory\'s Ministry of State Security. There was no immediate claim of responsibility or reports of injuries. Transnistria is a strip of land with about 470,000 people and about 1,500 Russian troops based there.\n\nMoldova\'s Foreign Ministry said “the aim of today’s incident is to create pretexts for straining the security situation in the Transnistrian region." The U.S. warned previously that Russia may launch “false-flag” attacks against its own side to create a pretext for invading other nations.\n\nLast week, Rustam Minnekayev, a Russian military commander, said the Kremlin wants full control of southern Ukraine, which he said would open the way to Transnistria.\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Ukrainian troops holed up in a steel plant in the strategic southern port city of Mariupol are tying down Russian forces and apparently keeping them from being added to the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas. Over the weekend, Russian forces launched new airstrikes on the Azovstal plant to try to dislodge the holdouts.\n\nSome 1,000 civilians were also said to be taking shelter at the steelworks, and the Russian military pledged to open a humanitarian corridor Monday for them to leave.\n\nThe Russian offer was met with skepticism by Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine does not consider the route safe and added that Russia had breached agreements on similar evacuation routes before. She called on the United Nations to oversee an evacuation.\n\nThe city council and mayor of Mariupol said a new mass grave has been identified about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities were trying to estimate the number of victims. It was at least the third new mass grave discovered in Russian-controlled areas near Mariupol in the last week.\n\nMariupol has been gutted by bombardment and fierce street fighting over the past two months. In addition to freeing up Russian troops, the capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said his country\'s goal is to maintain resistance and “make the occupiers’ stay in our land even more intolerable,” while Russia drains its resources.\n\nA top Ukrainian official cast doubt on the prospect of further talks between the two countries. Recent sessions in Istanbul ended without resolution earlier this month.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview that any negotiations other than talks between Zelenskyy and Putin would bring little resolution.\n\nBritain said it believes 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow began its invasion. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said 25% of the Russian combat units sent to Ukraine “have been rendered not combat effective."\n\nUkrainian officials have said about 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed as of mid-April.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Yuras Karmanau and Jon Gambrell in Lviv, Ukraine, and AP staff around the world contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP\'s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense.

"Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Authorities said a military unit was also targeted.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu convened an urgent security meeting following the blasts.\n\nThe breakaway Trans-Dniester region seceded from Moldova in 1992 along with Russian backing, although Moscow has not officially recognized the region\'s independence. The region borders Ukraine and Kyiv has voiced concerns that it could be used as a staging ground for Russian attacks.\n\n"In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05," the interior ministry of the in self-proclaimed "Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic" (PMR) said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the reports of blasts in the Trans-Dniester region were a cause for serious concern and Moscow was closely following the events.\n\nUN expects 8.3 million to flee Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday that it expects some 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine in the past two months, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said. This included 7.7 million internally displaced people and 5 million people who fled Ukraine across international borders.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," Mantoo said at a UN news briefing. Mantoo added that Syria has the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled the country.\n\nWatch video 05:00 Germany: Russian monks help Ukrainians, despite Russian Orthodox Church support for war\n\nUN doubles Ukraine aid appeal to $2.25 billion\n\nThe United Nations\' humanitarian agency (UN OCHA) said that it has been forced to double its aid appeal to $2.25 billion (€2.11 billion) as the humanitarian situation in the country worsens.\n\n"Over $2.25 billion is now required for needs inside Ukraine, more than double of the amount requested ($1.1 billion) when we launched the appeal on 1 March, a few days after the war began," the UN OCHA said in a statement.\n\nUS, allies will \'move heaven and Earth\' to meet Ukrainian security requirements — Defense Secretary\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that the aim of the conference at the air base in Ramstein, Germany was to "help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion," as well as to "build up Ukraine\'s defenses for tomorrow\'s challenges."\n\nAustin said that he discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Kyiv\'s "changing requirements" as Russia focuses on Ukraine\'s eastern Donbas region. Austin said that the US and its allies will "keep moving heaven and Earth" to meet Ukraine\'s security requirements.\n\n"Ukraine needs our help to win today, and they will still need our help when the war is over," Austin said. He added that the US and its allies have committed more than $5 billion of equipment to support Ukraine\'s defense since the start of the war.\n\nThe defense secretary said that Ukraine "has done a magnificent job defending its sovereignty against Russia\'s unprovoked invasion."\n\nAustin said that Ukraine\'s allies had provided assistance at "record speed," adding that "Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly."\n\nReferring to Russian troop withdrawal from areas around Ukraine\'s capital, Austin said that the war was "entering a new phase" following what he called "Russia\'s defeat at the battle of Kyiv."\n\n"Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man," Austin said, alluding to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens."\n\nWatch video 01:06 Austin: \'We\'re here to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia\'s unjust invasion\'\n\nExplosions hit radio facility in Russia-backed Trans-Dniester\n\nPolice in the breakaway Moldovan region of Trans-Dniester said that two explosions knocked two powerful antennas out of service in a radio facility close to Ukrainian border. The interior ministry of the region said those antennas were re-broadcasting Russian radio.\n\nThe incident occurred in a small town of Maiac about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the regional capital Tiraspol and roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said.\n\nThe explosions come just a day after several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the state security ministry in Tiraspol.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu is convening a meeting of the country\'s Supreme Security Council on Tuesday over incidents that took place in Trans-Dniester.\n\nTrans-Dniester is a narrow strip of land on the east bank of the Dniester River, sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova. The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow. Russia still has a military base there.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Trans-Dniester.\n\nGermany confirms it will send tanks to Ukraine\n\nThe German government confirmed reports that it will approve a delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, according to a statement seen by DW.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christina Lambrecht will announce the move during opening remarks at Ramstein air base, coming at the start of a US-hosted conference on Ukraine.\n\n"Yesterday we decided that Germany will make the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks possible to Ukraine," Lambrecht is expected to say, according to the statement.\n\nThe confirmation comes after German media reported on the move. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\'s government has come under increasing pressure over not yet sending heavy weapons to Ukraine.\n\nUS kicks off Ukraine conference at Ramstein air base\n\nA defense conference on securing Ukraine\'s long-term security is now underway at the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has invited around 40 countries to the conference. While many NATO members will be present, a number of the countries invited are not NATO member states.\n\nThe attendees will include NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht.\n\nThe meeting seeks to boost weapons deliveries to Ukraine and bolster the country\'s long-term security.\n\nAustin and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday and pledged additional military assistance to Kyiv. Austin and Blinken are expected to brief allies on Ukraine\'s security needs during the conference.\n\nWatch video 02:05 US to host talks on assistance for Ukraine in Germany\n\nNo imminent threat of direct confrontation with Russia — UK armed forces minister\n\nBritish Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said he did not think there was an imminent threat of escalation in the war in Ukraine leading to nuclear conflict.\n\n"What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia," Heappy told BBC television.\n\nHeappey\'s remarks follow a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" and that the "risks" of nuclear escalation were "considerable."\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

Guterres is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief "should focus primarily on one issue, evacuation of Mariupol," Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n"This is really something that the UN is capable of doing. And if he demonstrates political will, character, and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward," he said.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded fighters in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the Azovstal steel plant, but an estimated 100,000 civilians are also trapped in the city.\n\nKuleba also said he was concerned Guterres could fall into a Kremlin "trap." He cited trips to the Russian capital by foreign officials ahead of the invasion on February 24 as evidence of the Kremlin dictating diplomacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres is expected to head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Ukrainian troops still holding out in Mariupol\n\nZelenskyy urges Ukrainians to make country \'unbearable\' for Russian occupation\n\nUkraine\'s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called Ukrainians to think of how to make "the presence of occupiers at our land even more unbearable."\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskyy predicted Russia would lose the war, but said it would require sacrifice.\n\n"Every day of the fight will add years and years to the peaceful life after this war, after our victory," Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe was aware the Ukrainians wanted to know "when it all be over," but said "there is no simple answer to that at this time."\n\nUS to host Ukraine-focused defense talks at Germany\'s Ramstein air base\n\nThe US military expects officials from more than 20 countries to attend talks on Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is hosting the event following a trip to Kyiv, where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn remarks following his appearance in Kyiv on Monday, Austin said he would like "to see Russia weakened to the point where it can\'t do things like invade Ukraine."\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery and well-armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters traveling with him to Germany.\n\n"They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\'s really the purpose of this conference."\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is expected to attend the meeting, along with representatives from NATO and non-NATO countries.\n\nWatch video 03:34 US now clearly willing to provide Ukraine with what they need: military expert\n\nLavrov says NATO engaged in \'proxy war\' with Russia\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state television that NATO was "in essence engaged in war with Russia through a proxy" by supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian First Channel he said, "these weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia\'s military."\n\n"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once [by Russian forces]. How can it be otherwise? War means war," he said.\n\nThe foreign minister also said Monday evening that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable," Lavrov said.\n\nThe top diplomat said peace talks with Ukraine would continue.\n\nHe conceded the war in Ukraine would probably end finish with the signing of an accord but added the terms would depend on the military situation in the country at the time.\n\nAfter Lavrov\'s interview, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost its "last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine."\n\n"This only means Moscow senses defeat," he added.\n\nSummary of Monday\'s events in the Ukraine-Russia crisis\n\nVadym Boychenko, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, said a new mass grave had been identified 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the city. Several victims were located there, though authorities are trying to identify how many victims are in the unmarked graves.\n\nRussia said it expelled 40 German diplomats in response to Berlin\'s decision to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the move was unjustified as the Russian staff expelled from Germany had been "spies" rather than diplomats.\n\nWatch video 02:42 Russia expels German diplomats: Leonie von Hammerstein reports\n\nFinnish newspaper Italehti has reported Finland and Sweden have agreed to submit NATO applications at the same time during the week of May 16.\n\nSwedish paper Expressen writes that its sources confirm there is an agreement between the two countries.\n\nUkrainian Railways reported that five train stations in central and western Ukraine had come under fire and had been hit by missile strikes.

Not only that - Borisov built them a gas pipeline that bypassed Ukraine for BGN 3 billion (paid by Bulgarian taxpayers). Bulgaria will cope, there will be gas. Due to the extraordinary circumstances, it will be at a higher price in the beginning, but solutions will be sought in this direction as well. However, Putin\'s Russia has shown that it is not only not a reliable supplier, but also handles medieval racketeering tactics, violating an already concluded agreement under which it will still pay penalties" - commented the MP from Democratic Bulgaria Ivaylo Mirchev.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/OFFNews', 'image': 'https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-04/photo_verybig_214877.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:26'}

Credit: Wikipedia - Government.ru Novy Urengoy CC BY 3.0\n\nPoland and Bulgaria will both see their gas supplies turned off by Gazprom in Russia\n\n\n\nAs of today, Wednesday, April 27, Moscow has stopped Russian gas from flowing through the pipes of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline that supplies Poland, and also Germany. In a statement released yesterday, Tuesday 26, the Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom had terminated the contract.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference during an official visit to Berlin, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declared, “Poland is aware that soon we will not have gas from Russia. We have received threats from Russia, from Gazprom. They are related, among other things, to the form of payment, and this may be how Russia wants to punish us”,\n\nMorawiecki clarified, “Poland was previously preparing to diversify its energy sources, to obtain gas from other sources, even before the Baltic Gas Pipeline was inaugurated”, assuring that the gas supply in Polish homes is guaranteed.\n\n“We took into account several scenarios and we are prepared for them. PGNiG is ready to obtain gas from various sources through the Gaz-System transportation infrastructure, which has been constantly expanded over the years”, explained the PGNiG statement.\n\nGazprom has also informed Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz that it will cut off gas supplies to the country from today, April 27.\n\nAt the end of March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all foreign contractors of the Russian state energy company Gazprom “hostile to the Russian Federation” should pay for imported gas in roubles, but most EU countries, including Poland and Germany, did not accept those terms.\n\n“Our storage facilities are 86 per cent full”, the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, declared yesterday. She emphasised that “gas continues to be injected” in Poland, especially from Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Warsaw government had recently declared its intention to become independent from Russian gas by the end of 2022. In recent years, Putin has used gas as a diplomatic weapon in every crisis with the European Union.\n\nThis latest suspension of Gazprom through the Yamal gas pipeline, which passes through Belarusian territory, coincided with the escalation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border by Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.\n\nAs of November 2021, the Yamal pipeline barely carried a third of its normal capacity of Russian gas through Poland to Germany during the last six months. With the suspension and reduction of gas transit through Poland, the Russian state-owned company has caused the price of gas to increase throughout the European territory, as reported by larazon.es.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article, do remember to come back and check The Euro Weekly News website for all your up-to-date local and international news stories and remember, you can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'image': 'https://euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-of-gas-plant.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:34'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war.

Since then, the Russian gas provider had to take part in auctions for pipeline capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland.\n\nPoland\'s gas supply contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, and covers about 50pc of national consumption.\n\nEarlier, data from the EU network of gas transmission operators showed physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe route had halted, but they resumed later today.\n\nPoland\'s energy supplies are secure, Poland\'s climate ministry said today, adding that there was no need to draw from gas reserves and that gas to consumers would not be cut.\n\nThe country can source gas via two links with Germany including a reverse flow on the Yamal pipeline, a link with Lithuania with an annual capacity of 2.5 bcm that will open on May 1 and via an interconnector with the Czech Republic for up to 1.5 bcm.\n\nAnother 5-6 bcm could be shipped via a link with Slovakia to be opened later this year.\n\nIn addition, PGNiG can import up to 6 bcm per year via the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea, and it produces more than 3 bcm of gas per year locally in Poland. In October, a pipeline allowing up to 10 bcm of gas per year to flow between Poland and Norway, will be opened.\n\nGazprom said that Poland would need to begin making payments under a new scheme as of Tuesday. It did not elaborate and did not comment on PGNiG\'s statement about the possible gas supply stoppage.\n\nOnly a few Russian gas buyers, such as Hungary and Uniper, Germany\'s main importer of Russian gas, have said it would be possible to pay for future supplies under the scheme announced by Moscow without breaching EU sanctions.\n\nThe Kremlin said Gazprom was implementing the presidential decree on enforcing payment for gas supplies in roubles.\n\nPGNiG said it would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas according to the Yamal contract and that any halt of supplies was a breach of that contract.\n\nIt added it has the right to pursue damages over breach of contract.\n\nEarlier today, Poland announced a list of 50 Russian oligarchs and companies, including Gazprom, that would be subject to sanctions under a law passed earlier this month allowing their assets to be frozen. The law is separate from sanctions imposed jointly by EU countries.', 'image': 'https://www.independent.ie/world-news/84741/41590890.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/gas.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:56'}

"We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nPutin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia\'s military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.\n\nGuterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (see 2:02pm, below) for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\n6:45pm: Blinken says Putin not \'serious\' about Ukraine diplomacy\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the Ukraine war, despite a series of international efforts.\n\n“We’ve seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: “Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table.”\n\nBlinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlinken hailed what he saw on the trip and said that the US was speeding up arms deliveries, with the process now often taking only 72 hours after Ukraine sends requests.\n\n6:10pm: Germany confirms plans to send Ukraine tanks, in policy shift\n\nGermany said Tuesday it would send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a clear switch in Berlin’s cautious policy on military backing for Kyiv that was welcomed by the United States.\n\nThe government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the US Ramstein airbase.\n\nThe move comes after heavy criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to Ukraine, despite announcing a “turning point” in German defence policy in response to Russia’s invasion.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the pledge to send “some 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft systems”, the English name for the weapons, was “especially welcome”.\n\n5:19pm: US Defence Secretary says US, allies to meet monthly on arming Ukraine\n\nThe United States and its allies will meet once a month to discuss Ukraine\'s defence needs to battle invading Russian troops, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.\n\n"Today\'s gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine\'s self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States’ Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\n4:53pm: FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg on the fallout over blasts in Transnistria, Moldova\n\n02:48 © FRANCE 24\n\n4:08pm: Putin, Erdogan discuss humanitarian corridors in Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow’s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to a Kremlin statement, the leaders in a phone call talked about “efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors”.\n\nThis came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.\n\nThe Kremlin said Erdogan asked Putin about the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe Russian leader told him that “the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there”.\n\n3:09pm: Nearly 5.3 million flee Ukraine war as refugees, up more than 32,000 since Monday\n\nNearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.\n\nIn total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 32,753 over Monday\'s figure.\n\nWhile the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday (see 11:31am, below) that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.\n\n2:02 pm: Guterres says Russia, UN have \'very different\' views of events in Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had "very frank" discussions with Lavrov. He also admitted that Russia and the UN had "two very different versions" of what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n"According to Russia, it is a \'special military operation\' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations,” Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.\n\n“The sooner we end this war the better for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation and for those far beyond,” he said.\n\nAmid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.\n\n”Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated,” Guterres told the news conference.\n\n“The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol,” he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.\n\n12:54 pm: Russian rockets flew over Europe\'s biggest nuclear power plant: Ukraine\n\nUkraine\'s state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe\'s largest – on Tuesday.\n\nEnergoatom issued its latest warning about the risks caused by the war with Russia on the 36th anniversary of the world\'s worst nuclear accident at the now defunct Chernobyl plant, in what was then Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe company said cruise missiles had flown over the Zaporizhzhia plant during an air strike that local authorities said hit a commercial building in the southern city, killing at least one person.\n\n"Missiles lying at a low altitude directly over the site of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant), where there are seven nuclear facilities with a huge amount of nuclear material, poses huge risks," Petro Kotin, Energoatom\'s acting chief, said.\n\n"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEnergoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.\n\n12:36 pm: More blasts in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region, near Ukraine\n\nPolice in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.\n\nThe incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the border, according to the region’s interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.\n\nNo one was hurt in Tuesday\'s explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.\n\nTransdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.\n\nRussia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.\n\nA senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.\n\nThe US has warned of false flag operations in Transdniestria.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.\n\n12:06 pm: UN chief in Moscow calls for Ukraine ceasefire \'as soon as possible\'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Moscow for the highest-profile diplomatic mission to Russia since the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nHis schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.\n\nSpeaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.\n\nMinimising human suffering in Ukraine was the top priority, he added.\n\n11:31 am: UN expects 8.3 million refugees from Ukraine this year\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) is expecting around 8.3 million people to flee Ukraine this year, revising up its previous projection, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMore than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.\n\nUNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.\n\n"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.\n\nSyria remains the source of the biggest current refugee crisis in the world, with 6.8 million people having fled, she added.\n\n10:57 am: France determined to ‘deepen support’ for Ukraine: foreign minister\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France’s “determination to continue and deepen” its “support to Ukraine in all areas”.\n\nIn a statement released after his meeting Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Le Drian said the two ministers discussed the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol.

Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO,” said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nHere’s a clip of Austin’s opening remarks at the meeting:\n\n07:05\n\n10:02 am: Russian shelling in Kharkiv, rocket attacks in Zaporizhzhia\n\nRussian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country\'s second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine\'s General Staff.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Tuesday said its forces struck two ammunition depots in Kharkiv.\n\nIn the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and “eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.\n\nThe governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.\n\nFour people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.\n\nIn the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, two rockets hit commercial premises on Tuesday, killing one person, according to local authorities.\n\nRussia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine\'s industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.\n\nThe US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.\n\n09:07 am: UN’s Guterres to meet Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today for talks expected to focus on the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.\n\nKuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nThe Moscow trip comes a day after Guterres met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the UN chief joined the Turkish leader in stressing the urgent need for “effective access through humanitarian corridors” to evacuate Ukrainian civilians and deliver aid to communities impacted by the war.\n\nGuterres and Erdogan “reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nDuring the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n08:44 am: Donor community, not NATO, supplying arms to Ukraine: UK\n\nThe wider international community, not NATO, is providing military support to Ukraine, said British armed forces minister James Heappey, responding to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\'s assertions that the Western alliance was "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia.\n\n"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov\'s comments.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".\n\n00:35\n\n"Lavrov\'s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."\n\n08:31am: Germany to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine: media\n\nGermany will pledge to supply Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, without citing its sources.\n\nThe paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.\n\nThe Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military\'s air defence capability.\n\n08:19am: Russian offensive continues \'without much progress on the ground\'\n\nReporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, “because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces”. The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n01:42\n\n07:17am: Russia trying to encircle Ukrainian positions in east: UK military\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\'s east, according to the latest British military update.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain’s Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has “probably fallen” and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.\n\n"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/agUoc4mRcj\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/vnxIPbDJOZ — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 26, 2022\n\n07:10am: US hosts talks at Ramstein Air Base\n\nFollowing a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses … Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\n12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy.

Belarusians are a joke — as Russia\'s creeping annexation of their country suggests. And Ukrainians are delusional fascists with no right to exist — as Russian president Vladimir Putin has openly stated.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nGermany isn\'t quite as arrogant in its views of its eastern neighbours, but neither is it as welcoming as the open-hearted German self-image would suggest.\n\nFor Berlin, Poles are difficult — failing to appreciate that they need to follow Germany\'s sage example if they want to be fully European. The pejorative term "Polnische Wirtschaft" (meaning "Polish household") is no longer in use, but the sentiment remains.\n\nBelarusians are a cypher ruled by a dictator, while Ukrainians are hopelessly corrupt and quarrelsome — or were, until Russia attacked Ukraine on 24 February and unleashed a genocidal war.\n\nMeanwhile, continued German reference to World War II as the "Russlandkrieg" (meaning "Russia War") nicely illustrates ongoing German attitudes.\n\nGermany attacked, occupied, and destroyed huge swaths of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. Belarus lost about a third of its population, Poland and Ukraine a little under a fifth, and Jews, who lived in all three countries, were subjected to almost complete annihilation in the Holocaust.\n\nBy that grim comparison, Russia actually remained largely untouched — a Russia War indeed.\n\nThe current war on Ukraine has only reinforced Russia\'s dismissive attitudes toward Poles, Belarusians, and Ukrainians.\n\nFor Moscow, the Poles are "chronic Russo-phobes," Belarusians are unreliable allies, and Ukrainians must be destroyed.\n\nThe war has also begun to change German perceptions, most notably with respect to Ukrainians. Berlin has condemned the Russian aggression, adopted severe sanctions, mothballed the Nord Stream II pipeline, and supplied Ukraine with arms.\n\nBut old habits die hard — former German chancellor Angela Merkel still refuses to admit that her policies toward Russia enabled Putin.\n\nFormer chancellor Gerhard Schröder remains an unrepentant Putin apologist and a tacit supporter of Putin\'s genocide in Ukraine.\n\nDüsseldorf\'s ex-mayor, Thomas Geisel, a social democrat like Schröder, openly questions whether Russian atrocities in Ukraine are really as serious as Ukrainians say they are, while a group of left-wingers is calling on the German government to stop delivering arms to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to German analyst Constanze Stelzenmueller: "Germany\'s self-serving Russia policy and its self-inflicted energy dependence — part wilfully naive, part deeply corrupt — found eager supporters across the political party spectrum. They emboldened the Kremlin, and they enabled Vladimir Putin\'s war."\n\nThe fact is that, just as Russia\'s distaste for its eastern neighbours includes pretty much the whole spectrum of relevant political elites, so, too, Germany\'s prioritising of Russia still remains the default position of its establishment.\n\nSo, when German finance minister Christian Lindner said on 23 April that "we must do everything in our power to help Ukraine win, but the limit of the ethical responsibility is endangering our own security and endangering the defence capability of Nato territory," one appreciates his concern for Ukraine, but one also notes that he all but openly says Germany\'s security is not dependent on Ukraine, while it is dependent on Russia.\n\nGreat power games\n\nWhy do Germany and Russia think so much alike about their neighbours in between?\n\nThe answer may lie in history and in geopolitics: both countries have been great powers since the mid-18th century and their "natural" field of contention and cooperation has been eastern Europe. It stands to reason that their mental maps of the region would be similar.\n\nUnsurprisingly, eastern Europeans often view their relationship with Germany and Russia as similar to being trapped between a hammer and an anvil.\n\nAnd with good reason — modern history is full of examples of Russo-German conflict and cooperation resulting in death and destruction for the countries in between.\n\nRussia and Prussia (the forerunner of modern Germany) colluded in three partitions of Poland in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nWilhelmine Germany and Tsarist Russia were on opposing sides in World War I, and most of the warfare took place in today\'s Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland.\n\nIn 1922, Soviet Russia and Weimar Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo, thereby recognising each other diplomatically and opening the door to economic and military cooperation that enabled Germany to rearm. The losers were, once again, the newly independent states of eastern Europe.\n\nRusso-German relations temporarily worsened after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, but collaboration resumed after a Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in 1939, resulting in the fourth Polish partition and Russian aggression against the Baltic states.\n\nTwo years later, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and, as during the previous world war, the death and destruction were centred on the peoples of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine.\n\nPost-war Germany\'s policy of Ostpolitik led to a normalisation of relations with the Communist regimes of the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany, but eastern European democratic dissidents paid the price.\n\nFormer German chancellor Willy Brandt urged the Solidarność trade union movement in Poland to stop striking in 1980, and then, in 1985, while on an official state visit, purposely refrained from meeting with Solidarność activists, clearly signalling who Bonn\'s preferred interlocutors were and where Germany\'s interests supposedly lay.\n\nThe revolutions of 1989, Germany\'s reunification in 1990, and the Soviet Union\'s collapse in 1991 paved the way for the pro-Russian and pro-Putin policies that helped make Europe dependent on Russian gas, demonised Ukraine as irredeemably corrupt, and ignored the telltale signs of Putin\'s openly aggressive stance toward Russia\'s neighbours.\n\nGermany\'s neglect of its eastern neighbours and Russia\'s hostility to them facilitated the ongoing genocidal war.\n\nNo more great powers\n\nInasmuch as eastern Europeans have suffered both when Germany and Russia have fought and when they have cooperated, the solution to this problem has to be geopolitical.\n\nIn the short run, that means Ukraine\'s victory over Russia.\n\nIn the long run, Germany must remain a middle power and Russia must be denied great-power status. De-Putinizing the regime will help, but the only durable solution for peace is for Russia to break apart.', 'image': 'https://media.euobserver.com/771665bd9becd54a78aff46c75478260-800x.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:41'}

"And now at 90 years old, I have to experience another war," she added as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier leaned toward her.\n\nNeyman is from the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, or Dnipro. Now in emergency accommodation on the eastern outskirts of Berlin, she described to the German head of state how, during World War II, her mother fled with her to the North Caucasus region and then, as the Nazi army advanced, to Kazakhstan: "We tried to survive somehow."\n\nThe hail of bombs\n\nAnother survivor is Svetlana Sabudkina, a little younger than Neyman, who was born in Kyiv. She recalled how she "got caught in the hail of bombs" as a child with her Jewish mother in the city of Kharkiv and then survived in the Ural Mountains, where "a kind-hearted Russian woman took us in."\n\nSabundkina also remembers postwar Kyiv, when German soldiers, prisoners of war, helped to rebuild the destroyed city. She shared her school lunch with one of them: "I felt sorry for him."\n\nGermany\'s Steinmeier told the group of six Holocaust survivors, who escaped Ukraine to Germany despite their advanced ages, "It breaks my heart to meet people who have had to flee a war twice in their lives and now don\'t know if they will ever be able to return home."\n\nSteinmeier listens to Neyman\'s story\n\n\'Vicious cynicism\'\n\nSteinmeier said he was deeply affected by their stories. He spoke of the "truly vicious cynicism" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had cited the baseless claim of "denazification" as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine. The stories of these survivors, Steinmeier said, are proof of Putin\'s hypocrisy.\n\nMost of them come from eastern Ukraine, specifically Dnipro, a city that has been hit by Russian missiles almost every day for weeks. Steinmeier asked whether they were all transported by bus, to which Neyman responded that it took three days in an ambulance to get to the Ukrainian-Polish border. All six of them traveled to Poland, she said, and then on to Germany.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Steinmeier spoke of his mother, who was among the many ethnic Germans expelled from Poland at the end of World War II. "We were always very aware of what it means to lose your house and home and have to start over completely again," he said.\n\nSteinmeier\'s visit was well-received by the group of elderly survivors, one of whom asked for a selfie as he left. The others thanked him when he told them: "You are welcome here, you can rely on our help."\n\nThis reception came in stark contrast to the criticism directed at the president in recent weeks, which saw Kyiv refuse his offer of an official visit after he was accused of being too sympathetic to Russia during his two terms as foreign minister. Instead of traveling to Ukraine, he has been meeting displaced Ukrainians in Germany as well as Ukraine\'s Eastern European neighbors.\n\nJewish groups organize evacuations\n\nSo far, nearly 80 Holocaust survivors have fled to Germany from Ukraine and are being housed across the country.\n\nThe "El Jana" home in eastern Berlin is still fairly new. The full-time care facility was completed shortly before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and has not yet been fully occupied. Although the building is subjected to the roar of the nearby airport, street traffic, and trains, the building is an oasis of peace for its new inhabitants.\n\nThat the dozens of survivors have made it to Germany is thanks to the commitment and help from the Jewish Claims Conference (JCC), an organization that has been providing financial and medical assistance to Holocaust survivors for years.\n\nAs soon as they realized that the Russian invasion could jeopardize that assistance, the JCC set to work organizing evacuations. At first, only a handful wanted to leave their homes, but that number gradually increased, according to Rüdiger Mahlo, the JCC\'s representative in Germany.\n\nFor those who did not want to come to Germany, evacuations were also organized for Israel or other European destinations.\n\nWatch video 00:59 Ukrainian Holocaust survivors take shelter in Germany\n\nHelping hands\n\nAccording to Mahlo, more evacuees are arriving in Germany every day, a process that required around 50 people from 15 different organizations, including the Central Welfare Office of Jews in Germany (ZWST). Those assisting on a daily basis include full-time employees of welfare associations, but also many volunteers.\n\nAid workers have also been quick to thank the support of locals, who have donated the clothes, medical equipment, and other necessities that the new arrivals need.\n\nFor the El Jana facility, this also means a demanding commitment from employees who speak Russian, according to director Laura Rose. "For them, it means twelve-hour shifts now. There must always be someone there, even at night and on weekends, who speaks Russian," she said.\n\nAlthough the survivors thanked Steinmeier for the hospitality they have received in Germany, they made it clear that their wish for the future is to return to Ukraine.\n\n"Thank you for the very warm welcome. But still, we all want to go home as soon as possible," they told the president.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you\'re here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

How can it be otherwise?" Lavrov said. "NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war," he added.\n\nIn another interview late Monday, Lavrov vowed peace talks with Ukraine would continue even as he warned of a "real" danger of the conflict in Ukraine escalating into a third world war.\n\n"The danger is serious, it is real, you can\'t underestimate it," Lavrov told the Interfax news agency.\n\nThe foreign minister also told Russian state television that Moscow wants to reduce the chance of "artificially" elevating the risks of a nuclear conflict.\n\n"This is our key position on which we base everything.

Lavrov accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of "pretending" to negotiate.\n\nHe told Russian news agencies the content of peace talks would depend on the military situation and added, "Good will has its limits.

Kyiv won 3-2 in a charity match played in front of about 35,000 fans. All proceeds will go to victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n"It is about sending a signal, a sign of solidarity with Ukraine, earning a bit of money so that we can do one or the other humanitarian action. And then it is also a sign against this despicable war of aggression," Dortmund managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke told broadcasters ZDF.\n\nKyiv has played similar fund-raising matches in Warsaw, Istanbul and Cluj.\n\nPutin claims he hopes for diplomatic agreement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Moscow. In televised remarks, he told Guterres that he still hoped for negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n"Despite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track. We are negotiating, we do not reject [talks]," Putin told Guterres, who was visiting Moscow.\n\nHe said talks with Ukraine had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv. He claimed without evidence, that the massacres in Bucha were not carried out by Russians.\n\n"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."\n\nGuterres reiterated his call for Ukraine and Russia to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe broadcast discussions showed Guterres and Putin sitting opposite each other at the large oval table in the hall of the Senate Palace, following an hour-long meeting in the Kremlin.

It used to buy 30%-40% of its crude oil from Russia, with the remainder coming from international markets. Since the Russian invasion, it has been unable to obtain international credit, and has been sourcing almost all its crude oil from Russia.\n\nReuters news agency, citing two government sources, said Industry Minister Giancario Gieorgetti is planning to raise the prospect of nationalization when the Italian cabinet meets on Thursday.\n\nEuropean leaders are debating whether to impose an embargo on Russian oil.\n\nGermany \'very close\' to abandoning Russian oil\n\nThe German economy minister, Robert Habeck says the country is very close to completely halting imports of Russian oil.\n\nHabeck said Germany has cut oil import dependency from 35% to 12% in eight weeks.\n\n"Today I can say that an embargo is now more in reach for Germany. In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to expand this independence and rapidly move away from fossil fuels. But as I said, what a few weeks ago seemed a very large problem for Germany has shrunk considerably, so that German independence from Russian oil is now very very close."\n\nHabeck was speaking in Warsaw after talks with Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa.\n\nUS Defense Secretary addresses reporters at Ramstein\n\nThe US has convened more than 20 nations at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on behalf of Ukraine\'s defense. Speaking at the event, Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defense, told reporters that "we have to move at the speed of war."\n\nAustin said the US was determined to make better use of the US European Command\'s coordination mechanism and would extend the forum for Ukraine\'s defense into a monthly contact group.\n\n"We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbors and make it less able to do that," Austin said.\n\nAustin went on to express sharp criticism of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who warned on Monday that World War III might be looming.\n\n"You\'ve heard us say a number of times that that kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful," Austin said. "Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. Dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful. And something that we won\'t engage in," he added.\n\nUkraine concerned by destabilization in Trans-Dniester\n\nUkraine says it is concerned by attempts to worsen the security situation in Moldova\'s pro-Russian breakaway province of Trans-Dniester.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukraine presidential aide said in a post on Twitter: "Russia wants to destabilize the Transnistrian region and hints Moldova should wait for \'guests,\'" wrote on Twitter.\n\n"Bad news: if Ukraine falls tomorrow Russian troops will be at Chisinau\'s gates," Podolyak said, referring Moldova\'s capital. "Good news: Ukraine will definitely ensure strategic security of the region. But we need to work as a team," Podolyak added.\n\nIt comes after several apparent attacks in the region. In the past day, attacks have reportedly targeted a military unit, the state security headquarters and an old Soviet-era radio antennae.\n\nThe head of the breakaway province, also known as Transnistria or Transdniestra in English, claimed that the apparent attacks could be traced back to Ukraine.\n\n"I assume that those who organized this attack have the purpose of dragging Transdniestria into the conflict," self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency TASS.\n\nHis office has established a "red" level of "terrorist threat" for the next 15 days and canceled public Victory Day events on May 9, citing safety concerns.\n\nMoscow, which deploys troops in the region, also voiced serious concern and blamed Ukraine.\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has urged citizens to remain calm, saying she had stepped up security measures and convened the country\'s Supreme Security Council.\n\nShe condemned the apparent attacks, in which no one was injured.\n\nShe blamed the attack on "internal differences between various groups in Trans-Dniester that have an interest in destabilising the situation."\n\nLast week, a senior Russian military officer said Russia aims to take control of Ukraine\'s south and open a land corridor to the region.\n\nDefense journalist: German \'tanks\' could be a real help for Kyiv\n\nSecurity and defense journalist Thomas Wiegold has told DW the Gepard vehicles that Berlin has approved for delivery could make a real difference to Ukraine\'s fight in terms of anti-aircraft capability.\n\nAlthough they are known as tanks, Wiegold said, the Gepard — also known as Cheetah — vehicles are more of an anti-aircraft cannon mounted on an armored chassis.\n\n"They can make quite a difference. The German army has taken them out of use almost a decade ago, not because they were obsolete, but because at that time the Bundeswehr was scaling down and they had no use for it anymore."\n\n"I think they regretted it, meanwhile, because short-range air defense is much in demand everywhere now and especially in Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians can make use of it, of course."\n\nWiegold said that technically, the German government was only approving the German industry selling equipment to Ukraine, rather than sending it directly.\n\nHe said that, although an apparent U-turn, the decision "allows the government to convey the idea it\'s not that new, because it\'s not German [military] stock."\n\nWiegold said that much of the valuable heavy weaponry was coming from former Warsaw Pact countries that, like Ukraine, relied on Soviet-era equipment. However, he said that further down the line, the West would have to start sharing newer equipment, and train Ukrainians in how to use it.\n\n"If the West wants to continue supporting Ukraine, they have to think about starting training Ukrainians on Western systems to deliver Western systems as well."\n\nErdogan and Putin discuss peace talks, protecting civilians\n\nThe Kremlin says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have discussed Moscow\'s efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders spoke about "efforts made by Russia on a constant basis to ensure the safety of peaceful civilians, including the organisation of humanitarian corridors."\n\nIn response to Erdogan\'s questions on the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol, Putin said "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there," according to the Russian statement.\n\nHundreds of civilians are still sheltering in the city\'s huge Azovstal industrial area while Ukrainian troops are still resisting Russia.\n\nPutin told Erdogan that Kyiv should "take political responsibility and for humanitarian reasons, order them [the troops] to lay down arms," the Kremlin said.\n\nThey also discussed the safety of Turkish ships sailing from Black Sea ports through a cooperation of defense ministries.\n\nThe Turkish side released a statement saying Erdogan urged Putin to agree to direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nErdogan proposed taking the "Istanbul process to the level of leaders, a crucial threshold in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations," according to the statement. Talks have so far stalled over accusations of Russian war crimes. Putin later said peace efforts were at a dead end.\n\nPoland to sanction 50 Russian entities and people\n\nPoland has announced it will impose sanctions on 50 Russian entities and invidiuals.\n\nThe sanctions come in addition to current European Union measures, according to Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski.\n\nThe list includes Gas giant Gazprom and Moshe Kantor, who owns part of Poland\'s state-owned chemicals group Azoty.\n\nCompanies on the list will have their assets frozen and be excluded from public tenders, while Russian oligarchs on the list will be banned from entering Poland.\n\nUN ready to save lives in Mariupol — UN chief\n\nUN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the organization is ready to fully mobilize its resources to save lives in Mariupol.\n\n"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres also proposed coordinated work with the Red Cross to allow people to evacuate from the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Civilians and Ukrainian troops have been holed up in the plant for weeks.\n\n"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres said.\n\nGuterres said that he was concerned about possible war crimes in Ukraine, adding that they require independent investigation.\n\nUN chief meets Putin in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is holding a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following talks about the war in Moscow. He had also been due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the first in-person visit from Guterres since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring an earlier meeting with Lavrov, Guterres called for a cease-fire to be implemented "as soon as possible."\n\nRussia expels three Swedish diplomats\n\nRussia said it was expelling three Swedish diplomats in a retaliatory move against Stockholm.\n\nIn early April, Sweden said it was expelling three Russian diplomats who it accused of conducting "illegal operations" there.\n\nRussia\'s Foreign ministry said it summoned the Swedish ambassador to Russia and "strongly protested" the expulsion of Russian diplomats and Sweden\'s "military support to the Kyiv regime."\n\nThe ministry accused Sweden of "covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population of Donbas and Ukraine."\n\n"In response to this, the Russian side decided to declare persona non grata three diplomats of the Swedish embassy in Russia," the ministry said.\n\nCease-fire needed as soon as possible — UN chief says in Moscow\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that conditions for a cease-fire should be created as soon as possible.\n\n"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. He added that the priority is to "minimize human suffering" in Ukraine.\n\nGuterres is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin following his meeting with Lavrov.\n\nUkrainian troops to train on German soil — Defense Minister\n\nGerman Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian troops will be trained on German soil. The remarks stem from a statement she gave at the Ramstein US air base in Germany during a US-hosted defense conference.\n\n"We are working together with our American friends to train Ukrainian troops on artillery systems on German soil," Lambert said, according to a transcript seen by DW.\n\n"We will, along with the Netherlands, provide self-propelled howitzer and ammunition training to Ukraine, as we all know that artillery is an essential factor in this conflict."\n\nLambrecht addressed criticism leveled at Germany for not delivering heavier weaponry to Ukraine, and pointed to the government\'s decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks as progress.\n\nUN disarmament expert does not expect Russia to use nuclear weapons\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told DW on Tuesday that he does not envisage Russia using nuclear weapons, despite the Kremlin leaving the door open to such tactics.\n\n"I don\'t think that we are that close," to seeing nuclear weapons used in this war, he said. "And the main reason for that is that there are simply no plausible military missions for nuclear weapons in this type of war."\n\nBut Podvig stopped short of saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would refrain from using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to say with certainty whether he would refrain from that," he said.\n\nPodvig\'s comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he would not want to see a nuclear confrontation, but that "the danger is serious" and "should not be underestimated."\n\nWatch video 04:39 UN expert: \'No plausible missions for nuclear weapons\' in Ukraine\n\nMoldova reports blasts in breakaway Trans-Dniester region\n\nMoldovan authorities have reported two blasts that damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region.

The breakaway region seceded from Moldova after a brief military conflict in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this conflict, separatists were supported by Moscow.

I don\'t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation," Heappey said.\n\nHeappy also told Sky News that it is not NATO that is providing military support to Ukraine.\n\n"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," Heappy said.\n\nWatch video 02:00 Will Putin use \'tactical\' nuclear weapons in Ukraine?\n\nGermany reportedly to supply Ukraine with \'Gepard\' tanks\n\nAccording to the dpa news agency, Germany\'s federal government intends to allow tanks from industry stocks to be delivered to Ukraine.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war.

The fourth issue is security guarantees, an important issue, as we consider the United States to be a leader among those countries that are future guarantors of Ukraine’s security,” Zelenskyy said.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/25/us-officials-in-kyiv-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:12'}

He died in 1982 in a small town in the far north-east of Germany.\n\nBy contrast, Christian Lindner\'s grandparents - at least from one parental side - were from the western German town of Wuppertal, where they ran a bakery, according to the Munziger biographical archive (link in German).\n\nChristian Lindner, who was born in 1979, wrote in his autobiography about hanging around his grandparent\'s bakery as a boy. Assuming he was aged at least 10 at the time, that would have been many years after the former Nazi general Gerhard Lindner died in another part of the country.\n\n"Lindner" ranks the 107th most common name in Germany, with almost 17,000 Lindners currently living all over the country.\n\nClaim:\n\nA social media post suggests, that German health minister Karl Lauterbach\'s grandfather was "Hartmann Lauterbacher", who rose through the Hitler Youth to become one of the most senior members of the SS.\n\nHartmann Lauterbacher (left) was claimed to be the grandfather of German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach\n\nFact Check: False\n\nHartmann Lauterbacher, besides having a different surname (ending in "-er"), was born in Austria in 1909 and died in Bavaria in 1988, after a murky post-war life dodging war crime charges and intelligence services, as revealed by the German magazine Der Spiegel.\n\nThe current German Health Minister, however, was born into modest circumstances in 1963 in a small town near Germany\'s western border with the Netherlands. His father was born in 1935 and worked in a dairy, his mother looked after the household.\n\nDW was not able to establish details about the grandparents of Karl Lauterbach at the time of writing this article. However, in 1935 when Karl Lauterbach\'s father was born into a rural family in the far west of Germany, the Austrian Nazi Hartmann Lauterbacher was getting married in Braunschweig, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels as his best man.\n\nAt the timing of writing, Lauterbach\'s SPD had not responded to a DW request for comment.\n\n"Lauterbach" is not a common surname in Germany, ranked 891st with just over 3400 people.\n\nHowever, "Lauterbacher" is much rarer in Germany, ranking 99199th with just 30 individuals.\n\nClaim:\n\nA Telegram post claims that Jozef Tusk, member of the Security Service of the Reichsführer SS, is "a direct relative" of Polish politician Donald Tusk.\n\nThis montage is meant to show that Donald Tusk\'s grandfather was Jozef Tusk, member of the Security Service of the Reichsführer SS\n\nFact Check: Misleading\n\nThe misleading claim about Donald Tusk\'s grandfather has been circulating for many years. In 2005, DW covered the story as did the fact-checking website Fullfact in 2019. Donald Tusk\'s grandfather was indeed called Jozef Tusk, but he was never a member of the SS. The European Council told Fullfact that Jozef Tusk was a Polish citizen who was arrested by the Gestapo in September 1939. He was imprisoned in two concentration camps, released in 1942 and conscripted into the Wehrmacht, Nazi Germany\'s combined armed forces. Fullfact\'s research suggests that Tusk deserted in March 1945 and returned to Poland later that year.\n\nIn addition, the person shown in the photo with the misleading claim is not Jozef Tusk. According to the German Federal Archives, the uncropped photo was taken in September 1939 in Poland, close to Ustronie, and shows members of the intelligence agency of top SS official Heinrich Himmler ("Reichsführer SS"). According to the archives, the man in the photo alleged to be Donald Tusk\'s grandfather is a Sturmmann, or low-ranking member of the SS.\n\nA spokesperson for Tusk\'s European People\'s Party confirmed to DW that the photo did not show Donald Tusk\'s grandfather, and that Jozef Tusk was not a member of the Security Service of the Reichsführer-SS.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is relatively easy to debunk the photomontages alleging links between leading contemporary politicians and senior Nazis that are simply based on similar family names. Nevertheless, the claims continue to spread from their Russian source across social media and regularly crop up in many languages on social media.\n\nUta Steinwehr contributed to this report.\n\nEdited by: Rachel Baig', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61586417_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:31'}

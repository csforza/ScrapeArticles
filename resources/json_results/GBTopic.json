        "text": "Boris Johnson Urged to Help Free British Fighters Captured in Ukraine\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been urged to help free two British nationals who were captured by Russia when fighting in Mariupol.\n\nThe family of Aiden Aslin told a British TV broadcaster on Monday that they hope Johnson will help and have something \u201csorted out\u201d so the 28-year-old and his fellow Briton, 48-year-old Shaun Pinner, can be returned to their families.\n\nThe UK government said it\u2019s in touch with the two families to support them. It also condemned the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes and called for anyone detained to be treated humanely in accordance with the requirements of international humanitarian law.\n\nAslin, originally from Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, north England, and Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, east England, are both members of the Ukrainian armed forces. The families said they have both been in Ukraine since 2018, long before the Russian invasion of the eastern European country.\n\nThe pair were captured earlier this month after their unit had to surrender after 48 days of defending Mariupol as they were \u201crunning out of ammunition.\u201d\n\nThey later appeared on Russian state TV, asking Johnson to help exchange for them with Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who was arrested by the Ukrainian secret services on April 12. It\u2019s not clear if they were under duress.\n\nBoth appeared to have bruises and Aslin appeared to have been beaten. Their families later said they were in contact with the UK\u2019s Foreign Office to ensure the Russian authorities \u201cmeet their obligations to prisoners of war under international law.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry on April 21 said \u201cthe Russian side [was] taking care of them,\u201d and they were \u201cfed, watered, and given the necessary assistance. Just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained.\u201d\n\nA Russian national flag flies by destroyed buildings in Mariupol, Ukraine, on April 12, 2022.

The International Committee of the Red Cross also recommends not publishing images that identify prisoners of war, or show them in humiliating or degrading situations unless there\u2019s a \u201ccompelling public interest\u201d in doing so in accordance with the Geneva Convention.\n\nBut Aslin\u2019s mother Angela and his brother Nathan spoke to TalkTV on Monday, pleading for Johnson\u2019s help. Pinner\u2019s family also previously released a statement through the FCDO, rebuking Russian media\u2019s characterisation of foreign fighters in the Ukrainian military as \u201cmercenaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope that, at some point, there will be a prisoner swap. However, it\u2019s out of my hands. It is between Ukraine and Russia,\u201d Nathan Aslin told TalkTV.\n\nOutlining his recent phone conversation with his brother, Nathan Aslin told the broadcaster, \u201cIt was obvious that he was with the Russian people that were holding him and he was asking for me to contact Boris [Johnson] to get this prison swap done. And to keep on asking for this swap.\u201d\n\nAsked what he would say to the prime minister, Nathan said: \u201cAct now when you got the time to act. You\u2019ve got two British citizens on the line, being forced to say whatever the Russians are putting in [their] mouths at gunpoint, whether they show it on the camera or not. And it\u2019s a moral obligation to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAngela Aslin added: \u201cI would like to hope that Boris will help. And talk to the Ukraine government [and] embassy. There can be something sorted out so that these two guys can come home.\u201d\n\nAslin moved to Ukraine in 2018 with his Ukrainian fianc\u00e9e and now holds British and Ukrainian citizenship. He previously fought the ISIS terrorist group with Kurdish militia People\u2019s Defense Units in Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nPinner\u2019s family previously said that the former British Army soldier decided to relocate to Ukraine in 2019 \u201cto use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Pinner \u201cenjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country\u201d where he also met his Ukrainian wife.\n\nForeign Office minister James Cleverly on Tuesday confirmed that Aslin and Pinner should be treated as prisoners of war.\n\nAsked about the pair by Aslin\u2019s local MP\u2014former housing minister Robert Jenrick\u2014Cleverly told Parliament he had discussed the issue of foreign volunteer fighters with the Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201cThey are clear, and we are clear, that those fighting under the Ukrainian flag for the Ukrainian armed forces in the defence of Ukraine should be treated as Ukrainian military and as prisoners of war, with all the protections that the international humanitarian law affords to those individuals,\u201d Cleverly said.\n\nThe UK government advises against all travel to Ukraine.",

        "text": "Boris Johnson has said the public deserves a \u201ccheaper, faster\u201d passport service as he refused to rule out privatisation if it cannot clear the backlog of applications.\n\nEarlier, a senior Government source said the Prime Minister was ready to \u201cprivatise the arse\u201d out of the Passport Office amid fears families could miss out on their summer holidays due to delays in renewing their documents.\n\nIn an interview with TalkTV, Mr Johnson said his sole concern was to \u201cdeliver value and a good service\u201d to the public.\n\nIf you want to go on holiday with your family it can cost hundreds of pounds to get new passports. You deserve to have a cheaper, faster service. Boris Johnson\n\n\u201cI am not going to rule anything out. I don\u2019t mind whether it is in the public or the private sector,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat I want is for it to deliver value for money and help people\u2019s costs. If you want to go on holiday with your family it can cost hundreds of pounds to get new passports.\n\n\u201cYou deserve to have a cheaper, faster service.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson was also said to have put the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and other \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d bodies on notice in comments to Cabinet ministers, according to the source who attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\n\nThe Prime Minister is understood to be \u201chorrified\u201d at the backlog in dealing with passport applications and will summon the agency\u2019s leadership for urgent talks at No 10 on Thursday.\n\nHe is said to be concerned that families wanting to go on summer holidays are under pressure to pay up to \u00a3100 extra per passport for fast-track applications because of delays.\n\nThe source cautioned that privatisation would not be the starting point, but warned that Downing Street could look to businesses to take over if passport bosses could not meet the 10-week target for standard applications costing \u00a375.50.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Johnson acknowledged that he had criticised \u201cpost-Covid, work-from-home, manana culture\u201d at some of the bodies for not adapting after the easing of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nAs well as the Passport Office, MPs have been raising concerns over significant delays in turning around applications for licences at the DVLA.\n\n\u201cI think that we have a general issue in some of our approach to public services. We all got used to working from home, Zoom calls,\u201d Mr Johnson said.\n\n\u201cI am the custodian of the public purse I have to ask myself whether it is as productive as all that.\u201d\n\nDowning Street chief of staff Steve Barclay is expected to meet with Passport Office officials later this week.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman would not comment on Cabinet leaks, but told reporters: \u201cThe Prime Minister is adamant this is a serious issue facing families and it\u2019s one that needs to be gripped.\u201d\n\nIn response to the criticism, a spokesperson for HM Passport Office said: \u201cSince April 2021, we have been advising people to allow up to 10 weeks when applying for their British passport as more than five million people delayed applying due to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe urge people who need a new passport to apply for one as soon as possible, with the vast majority of all passport applications being dealt with well within 10 weeks.\n\n\u201cTo deal with this demand, we have increased staff numbers by 500 since April 2021. This has helped us to handle more applications than ever before, with more than one million passport applications processed in March 2022.\u201d\n\nHeathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said it was \u201cvital\u201d that people could go on holiday this summer in case the UK reintroduced coronavirus travel restrictions.\n\nMr Holland-Kaye told the PA news agency: \u201cNormally the Passport Office is very slick in processing passports. It\u2019s really disappointing to hear (about delays).\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not resolved, it is going to mean that people can\u2019t get away.\n\n\u201cAfter two years of lockdown, we need to make sure people can have a good holiday because many of them have vouchers that they\u2019ve been saving up, they\u2019ve got trips of a lifetime that they\u2019ve put on hold, and we don\u2019t know when things might get closed down again.\n\n\u201cMaking the most of the summer is vital.\u201d\n\nThe PCS union condemned the Prime Minister\u2019s suggestion that HM Passport Office could be privatised.\n\nGeneral secretary Mark Serwotka said: \u201cIt is absurd for Boris Johnson to threaten to privatise HMPO, when it is clear that the current problems are mainly down to the casualisation of the workforce.\u201d\n\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that families are having to cancel hard-earned holidays costing thousands of pounds because of chaos and delays at the Passport Office.\n\n\u201cHome Office ministers were warned many months ago that they needed to prepare for an increase in demand after Covid, but they have completely failed to do so and families are paying the price.\u201d",

        "text": "John Wilkins was editor of The Tablet for 21 years until 2003. He had previously been assistant editor of the paper in 1967 but left to join the BBC, rejoining it as editor in 1982. During his time as editor, circulation of The Tablet almost tripled. He was born in 1936, he went to Clare College Cambridge, and did his national service with the Gloucestershire Regiment.\n\nThose are some of the bare facts about John Wilkins. But bare facts cannot do justice to one of the most lovable men I have known. I wrote for a number of years for him as an editor \u2013 he was especially hospitable to my pieces about the war in the former Yugoslavia \u2013 but he was also a great friend. He was a bachelor \u2013 I gathered the woman whom he would have married, died \u2013 and much of the time and energy that might have been expended on a family was devoted to the paper he edited and to his friends.\n\nTo both he was utterly generous. He took enormous trouble in editing The Tablet, expending huge effort in commissioning and editing, and getting every detail of the tone and balance of the leaders right. He would go to endless trouble to search out the right people to write and to interview; his range of acquaintance was enormous and he was endlessly helpful in sharing his insights and his contacts. On one occasion he made the long and difficult journey to Tubingen University to interview the dissident theologian, Hans Kung (and remarked wonderingly that the great man did not offer him a cup of tea when he got there). He would agonise over every aspect of the paper, and would quite often stretch deadlines right to the brink of edition times, to the exasperation of his colleagues. When he retired, after the Christmas edition in 2003, the valedictory address at his leaving party was made by Shirley Williams, his friend, who paid tribute to the breadth of his sympathies, social and political.\n\nHe was an enthusiast for the Second Vatican Council, and was intensely sympathetic to its spirit. He himself was a convert to Catholicism, starting first as a Methodist, like his mother, who was a devoted member of that church, then joining the Church of England. Finally, he became a Catholic, quite simply because he realised that he felt at home in the company of Catholics, and had become a Catholic almost unconsciously. As a convert, he was less troubled by the liturgical changes that followed the Council than many others. He was equally at home with all forms of Catholic worship, traditional and modern; these things, he felt, did not matter very much in the end. The Tablet, under his editorship, and especially with Clifford Longley as leaderwriter, was liberal in its politics, but he never sought to be uncharitable to those of other views; his own language was always temperate and considered. His voice was gentle and mellifluous; he looked and sounded like a benign don.\n\nHe was an extraordinarily good listener, simply because he was interested in what absolutely everyone had to say. At any dinner, people would unburden themselves to him because he focused intently on them; it was almost a pastoral gift. And he would engage wholeheartedly in conversation. Once when we had begun a discussion of a subject that interested him at a dinner in my flat, he came to see me the following morning, having walked through the pouring rain, to take up the discussion where we had left it. In retirement he was as sociable as ever. He was often sought for a disinterested take on church affairs by broadcasters and other journalists.\n\nHis one passion in life was birdwatching, though he denied he belonged to that specialist breed of obsessives known as Twitchers. The pursuit came about from his extended illness as a boy, when he would watch birds endlessly from his bedroom window. He was extraordinarily knowledgeable, easily able to identify birds by their song as well as appearance and habits.\n\nIn a tribute to John Wilkins, his friend Hugo Young quoted his first editorial in the paper, which was republished in a book of essays edited by Austen Ivereigh. It says much about his feeling for the Church:\n\n\u201cOur concern is with the world as much as with the Church: with everything that is human. We shall seek to inform and interpret as well as to comment. We shall seek to entertain. Above all, we shall hope that in the future, as in the past, readers may find in our pages that message without which the world perishes.\u201d\n\nMany readers of The Catholic Herald will have differed with John Wilkins on matters of Church teaching and governance, but with the spirit of that leader, none of us can disagree. He loved the Church and his work was a kind of vocation within it. He was a good man. Requiescat in pace.\n\n(Photo courtesy of The Tablet)",

The French government has complained about the UK\u2019s reluctance to issue fishing licences to French fishermen, claiming it was a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly expressed frustration over France\u2019s alleged failure to prevent illegal immigrants from boarding small boats and crossing the English Channel into Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson, who led the Brexit campaign and took the UK out of the EU, has more common ground with Le Pen than Macron on the issue of EU membership.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, though she insisted during the election campaign she had no \u201csecret agenda\u201d this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nMarine Le Pen, presidential candidate, delivers her concession speech after early result projections show France\u2019s incumbent President Emmanuel Macron heading to win a second five-year term as president, in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

However, it is expected around 33,000 Ukrainian refugees will have arrived by the end of next month.\n\nA team within the Department of Housing, a new vacant housing delivery unit headed up by a senior retired chief executive, will be responsible for the delivery of other properties that require more extensive works to be repurposed.\n\nThis will involve fast tracking the necessary works, procuring this work and ultimately bringing further properties on stream across the country in good locations, Mr O'Brien said.\n\nCompletion of these buildings will typically take between three and nine months and will lead to the creation of a further 3,000 to 4,000 bed spaces.\n\nNew Cabinet sub-committee to oversee refugee assistance\n\nMeanwhile, the Cabinet has decided to create a new sub-committee to oversee assistance being given to people fleeing Ukraine.\n\nIt is believed that Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath is to tell colleagues that the projected cost of helping Ukrainians next year is \u20ac3 billion, up from a \u20ac2.5 billion estimate in March.\n\nSpeaking on his way into Cabinet this morning, Mr McGrath said we are now at a point where we can no longer rely on traditional emergency accommodation like hotels and B&Bs to house Ukrainian people.\n\n\"That system is now under real pressure and that is why we've had to use facilities such as Millstreet, and I think its likely we'll see more examples like that depending on the number of refugees that continue to come to Ireland but we will do the very best that we can,\" he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nLatest Ukraine news\n\nMinister McGrath said the main focus of Cabinet discussions today would be the accommodation needs of Ukrainian people and looking at all the available options to Government to find accommodation quickly.\n\n\"The system is now under real strain and we are at a point where we are offering accommodation that is not of a standard we would like.\"\n\nHe said the Housing Minister would have a memo outlining the options.\n\nMr McGrath will also provide the latest statistical analysis from his department on the costs arising from measures to deal both with Covid-19 and the Ukrainian refugee crisis.\n\nProvision has been made for costs of up to \u20ac3bn to house people arriving from Ukraine as Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath has said 'the system is now under real strain' | Read more: https://t.co/FW6jYYmtdJ pic.twitter.com/MJ8xEjpZNd \u2014 RT\u00c9 News (@rtenews) April 26, 2022\n\nAlso speaking before the Cabinet meeting, Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said that he met a number of Ukrainian refugees in Millstreet Arena, where many have been living since last week.\n\n\"Their gratitude to the kindness of the people of Ireland was heartfelt. They spoke very movingly of the sense warmth and friendliness that they have experienced here since they arrived,\" Mr Martin said.\n\n\"This is a horrific war that's having a terrible toll on families and on shared humanity. We must do everything we possibly can within our energies and with our resources to do what we can.\n\n\"We want this war to end. It should end, because too much life was lost.\"\n\nTaoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin has said 'we must do everything we possibly can, within our energies and resources' to help those arriving in Ireland after fleeing from the war in Ukraine | Read more: https://t.co/FW6jYYmtdJ pic.twitter.com/YXKAzrHUYV \u2014 RT\u00c9 News (@rtenews) April 26, 2022\n\nAt the end of March, the Government estimated that it would cost \u20ac2.5 billion to look after 100,000 Ukrainian refugees next year, with Mr McGrath saying: \"The cost will be high but these are costs that we have to meet. It is the right thing to do.\"\n\nThe Government is keen to ensure that the work to assist Ukrainian refugees does not come at the expense of people who are on housing waiting lists or in emergency accommodation.\n\nMr O'Brien has previously said that he expects Ireland will have to build an additional 33,000-35,000 homes, over a five-year period, to deal with the demand for housing posed by the need to help people from Ukraine.\n\nLast week, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said that Ireland will not cap the number of refugees it accepts, insisting that they will continue to be welcomed.\n\nAccommodation pledges to receive call this week\n\nA refugee cries after she arrived at a border crossing between Romania and Ukraine\n\nAnyone who has pledged accommodation to Ukrainian refugees will have received a call back by Thursday of this week, according to Secretary General of the Irish Red Cross Liam O'Dwyer.\n\nMr O'Dwyer said that the Red Cross is conscious that people have made very generous offers and emails were sent to those 9,000 people who had proven uncontactable.\n\nHe added that there was a reasonable response to the emails, with around 8,000 people responding.\n\nOf those, around 2,000 said they were unable to continue with the accommodation pledge.\n\nHowever, Mr O'Dwyer said that a sizeable number of those people who said they were unable to continue had already taken people in.\n\nMr O'Dwyer said people are being asked to host refugees for six months to a year, but said that the Ukrainian crisis is \"going beyond what most of us thought would be a short-term situation\".\n\nThe CEO of the McVerry Trust said there will be pressure to deliver more housing to both Ukrainian refugees and the homeless in Ireland, but believes that both schemes can operate and deliver as necessary.\n\nPat Doyle said the Trust is going ahead with major building and refurbishment programmes and providing emergency accommodation.\n\nAt the same time, he said the Trust is also working with around 2,000 Ukrainians and said the charity has been working with hotels for years in order to accommodate people coming into the country.\n\nAdditional reporting: Paul Cunningham, Laura Hogan",

Fundamentally it is probably a multimillion-pound industry that has been franchised into films. To say that we need to protect some of our brightest and our best from the likes of Harry Potter is to not only do our universities a disservice but to do our students a disservice,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not the way to ensure that they can enter the world having those skills at their fingertips \u2013 the ability to challenge, to be critically astute \u2013 and that\u2019s certainly not the interpretation that I\u2019d had talking to students, that they want or they need this from their universities,\u201d she added.\n\nMs Donelan said \u201cstudents have to be able to live in the real world once they graduate university\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are no trigger warnings every day as you operate. I\u2019ve not met students who have called for these trigger warnings either. They are not the issues that students are bringing up to me \u2013 they\u2019re bringing up sexual harassment, they\u2019re bringing up antisemitism,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Donelan said for universities that have not yet signed up to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, it \u201cmakes you question whether they are getting their priorities right\u201d, adding that universities should focus on tackling harassment and antisemitism rather than looking at trigger warnings on content.\n\n\u201cI think their priorities, fundamentally, should be the welfare, the wellbeing and the education of students.\u201d\n\nShe said there is \u201can undeniable link between quality and free speech\u201d, noting that 86% of Nobel Prize winners come from countries with the highest rating for academic freedom while just 1% are from countries with the lowest rating.\n\nMs Donelan said: \u201cVice-chancellors need to ensure that they\u2019re not on the wrong side of history on this. We want them to proactively be supporting their members of staff \u2013 they may face criticism but certainly shouldn\u2019t face harassment when they put forward their views and their academic research.\u201d\n\nWho would you rather employ - an inquisitive, critical, open-minded graduate, or a self-contained cookie-cutter graduate who is afraid to be challenged or confront new ideas? Universities Minister Michelle Donelan\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms Donelan told a meeting at the Policy Exchange think tank in London that supporting free speech is \u201cno longer enough\u201d and it is \u201csomething that has to be actively defended\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhere would we be now if the views of 100 or even 200 years ago had never been challenged? As a woman, I doubt I would be a Member of Parliament, let alone the Minister for Higher and Further Education,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut, sadly, where once we found critical debate and arguments which were run on their merit, today we have seen an upsurge in physical threats and complete intolerance of opposing ideas.\u201d\n\nShe said professors have been \u201charangued and hounded just for doing their jobs\u201d and \u201cprominent, well-respected guests no-platformed\u201d.\n\nAcademics are \u201cself-censoring themselves\u201d in this climate, she added.\n\nMs Donelan said graduates will lose out from this over the long term.\n\n\u201cWho would you rather employ \u2013 an inquisitive, critical, open-minded graduate, or a self-contained cookie-cutter graduate who is afraid to be challenged or confront new ideas?\u201d\n\nMs Donelan said she found it \u201ccompletely deplorable\u201d that, last year, \u201cbalaclava-clad protesters forced a female academic, Kathleen Stock, to stay off campus under threats of physical violence\u201d, referring to the professor who quit the University of Sussex due to her views on gender identity.\n\nThis was not an \u201cisolated event\u201d, the minister added, as just a few weeks later an \u201cintolerant mob\u201d threatened the Israeli ambassador outside an event held at the London School of Economics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about peaceful protest here, the right of which of course is sacrosanct. We are talking about threats, intimidation and harassment.\u201d\n\nMs Donelan said Policy Exchange polling had shown that 32% of academics identifying as right-wing had refrained from airing their views in teaching or research, while around 15% identifying as politically centrist or left-wing also reported self-censoring.\n\nVice-chancellors, academics and students should not \u201callow the history books to record your name as part of the small cabal of the intolerant\u201d, she said.\n\nVCs need to \u201cgo into bat\u201d for their staff and \u201cput their money where their mouth is\u201d on the issue rather than bowing to the \u201cintolerant few\u201d.\n\nThe Government\u2019s Free Speech Bill has been carried over to the next session of Parliament.\n\nMs Donelan said she expects the House of Lords will have \u201ca lot to say on this subject\u201d but that the Bill is less about what happens in Parliament than \u201ca culture change that will reverberate through the sector\u201d.",

It is vital that we do more to mitigate those impacts, to seek to reduce the pace of warming but also to adapt to it. We have committed \u00a3243 million since 2015 through the Agri-Environment Climate Scheme to support land management practices which protect and enhance Scotland\u2019s natural heritage, improve water quality, manage flood risk and mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\n\u201cScotland is renowned worldwide for the quality of our water. Research like this will be hugely valuable in informing the development of policy solutions and measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and also protect, restore and enhance these vital natural assets.\u201d\n\nFreshwater ecologist Dr Linda May of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), lead author of the report, said:\n\n\u201cThis research has shown, for the first time, that climate change is already warming our lochs and reservoirs in Scotland, and that this trend is likely to continue.\n\n\u201cIt provides early warning of the potential impacts of climate change on biodiversity, water supply and recreational use, and highlights the need for mitigation measures to be put in place as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nDr Pauline Lang, project manager for CREW, said:\n\n\u201cThis pioneering research led by experts at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology demonstrates that, without intervention, climate-driven risk is projected to further increase by 2040. To prevent the modelled scenarios becoming reality, we trust the recommendations proposed will enable effective climate action for safeguarding freshwaters now and during the critical decades ahead.\n\n\u201cThis project is a great example of how CREW can pivot towards Scotland\u2019s water-related needs by bringing a community of researchers and stakeholders together to collaborate on addressing the most important environmental concerns of this time.\u201d\n\nNatureScot Freshwater and Wetlands Advice Manager Iain Sime said:\n\n\u201cScotland, like the rest of the world, is facing an unprecedented climate emergency. The findings of this comprehensive review are stark, demonstrating the impact that climate change is already having on our freshwater lochs and reservoirs, and their biodiversity.\n\n\u201cThe need for urgent action is clear, and at NatureScot we are using the \u00a365m Nature Restoration Fund to prioritise efforts that support the conservation of our lochs and ponds.\u201d\n\nScottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) Senior Ecologist Ian Milne said: \u201cCREW\u2019s report, which used SEPA data from 142 lochs and reservoirs, is important in highlighting some of the climate change pressures Scotland\u2019s environment is facing.\n\n\u201cThe findings emphasise the significance of SEPA\u2019s ongoing work to tackle the threats of climate change and biodiversity loss, which is being done in partnership with Scottish Government, local authorities, Scottish Water, environment and community groups, farmers, land managers and others through our River Basin Management Plans.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nAssessing climate change impacts on the water quality of Scottish standing waters has been developed by Scotland\u2019s Centre of Expertise for Waters (CREW), in collaboration with NatureScot, SEPA, Scottish Water, Scottish Government and a team of researchers from the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH).\n\nMonitoring between 2015 and 2019 showed that there was an increase in water temperature at 97% of Scottish lochs and reservoirs for which there were sufficient data.\n\nWhile most (88%) warmed by 0.25\u00b0C to 1.0\u00b0C per year over this period, 9% increased by more than that \u2013 some by up to 1.3\u00b0C per year.\n\nWarming and changes in rainfall patterns associated with climate change increase the risk of outbreaks of harmful algal blooms, which outcompete other freshwater plant species and produce toxins that can affect animals and people.\n\nThe report makes a number of recommendations; these include reducing the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen entering lochs and reservoirs from their catchments, because these are the main driver of algal blooms. Sources of these plant nutrients - present in synthetic fertilisers as well as human and animal waste - include farm runoff and waste water discharges. Actions, such as the creation of buffer strips and constructed wetlands, are already under way in many catchments across Scotland aimed at reducing nutrient inputs.\n\nFunded by the Scottish Government, Scotland's Centre of Expertise for Waters (CREW) is a partnership between the James Hutton Institute and Scottish higher education and research institutes.",

(Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nUK Officials Examining Links Between Adenovirus and Hepatitis in Children\n\nHealth officials in the UK say they are focusing on a possible adenovirus link to cases of severe hepatitis\u2014or liver inflammation\u2014in children.\n\nThere have been at least 169 cases of \u201cacute hepatitis of unknown origin\u201d recorded worldwide, and one death, while 10 children in the UK alone have needed liver transplants.\n\nHepatitis can be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\nThe cause of the spike in cases among children remains unknown, but British health officials say a strain of adenovirus called F41 could be the most probable cause.\n\nAdenovirus, a viral infection that usually causes the common cold, was detected in 75 percent of the confirmed cases tested, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said in a statement on Monday.\n\nAdenovirus, a common group of viruses, is now circulating in children at higher than average levels after dropping to unusually low levels during the pandemic. One avenue of inquiry being explored is that the outbreak may be linked to a surge in common viral infections after COVID-19 restrictions were phased out. Children who weren\u2019t exposed to adenovirus over the last two years may now be getting hit harder when they are exposed to the viruses.\n\n\u201cInformation gathered through our investigations increasingly suggests that this rise in sudden onset hepatitis in children is linked to adenovirus infection,\u201d said Dr. Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA. \u201cHowever, we are thoroughly investigating other potential causes.\u201d\n\nThe British health agency said in a briefing Monday that there may be \u201ca cofactor causing a normal adenovirus to produce a more severe clinical presentation in young children.\u201d\n\nThis could be an \u201cincreased susceptibility due to reduced exposure during the pandemic, prior SARS-CoV-2 or other infection, or a yet undiscovered coinfection or toxin,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cAlternatively, there may have been emergence of a novel adenovirus strain with altered characteristics,\u201d UKHSA said.\n\nThe majority of children affected are under the age of 5 and have presented symptoms of gastroenteritis illness\u2014diarrhoea and nausea\u2014as well as jaundice, which is the yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.\n\nUK public health officials have ruled out any links to COVID-19 vaccines, saying none of the affected children were vaccinated.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory last week after children in Alabama were discovered to have adenovirus and hepatitis infections.\n\nThe CDC said that five pediatric patients with significant liver injury, including three with acute liver failure, who also tested positive for adenovirus, were reported to the agency by an Alabama hospital.\n\nThe CDC added that the children were previously healthy and that none had COVID-19.\n\nTwo cases were also identified in North Carolina, health department officials said.\n\nCases have also been found in Denmark, Spain, and the Netherlands, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nJack Phillips and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "text": "When Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the throne on 6 February 1952, she joined a large group of European rulers. In this series, Royal Central looks at the men and women who were ruling on the continent as the longest reign in modern European history got under way.\n\nKing Haakon VII of Norway\n\nThe first monarch of an independent Norway, King Haakon VII was more than a fellow monarch at the time of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s accession: he was family.\n\nHaakon was born Prince Carl of Denmark, and could have never dreamed that one day he would become the king of a newly-independent Norway. In 1905, following the separation of Sweden and Norway, he was offered the Norwegian throne, but first insisted on a plebiscite to show that the public truly wanted him for their monarch.\n\nWhen the results came back that 79% of the public wished to retain a monarchy, he was formally offered the throne, and became Norway\u2019s first modern king on 18 November 1905.\n\nHaakon married Maud of Wales, a daughter of Edward VII, in 1896; making his descendants cousins to Queen Elizabeth II. His son and only child, Olav, was a first cousin to George VI; the current Norwegian king, Harald, is a second cousin to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAs a newcomer to his new country, Haakon devoted himself to learning everything he could about Norway. He travelled extensively within the country and endeared himself to the public. He worked to make the monarchy representative for the people while also maintaining its sense of tradition; and during the Second World War, led with aplomb even as he set up a government-in-exile. The Norwegian Royal Family returned to great fanfare exactly five years to the day after they were evacuated, on 7 June 1945.\n\nThe post-war years of Haakon\u2019s reign continued much in the same fashion as his early reign; spending time travelling around Norway to see how the people had been affected by, and were rebuilding from, the war. He attended the funeral of his nephew, George VI, in 1952.\n\nAt Queen Elizabeth\u2019s coronation, King Haakon was represented by his son and daughter-in-law, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, and his daughter, Princess Astrid. One of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s earliest state visits was to Norway, which she visited from 24\u201326 June 1955.\n\nHaakon\u2019s health began to decline in the late \u201850s. A fall in 1955 led to him using a wheelchair for the rest of his life; and his health began to rapidly decline over the summer of 1957. He passed away on 21 September 1957, and was succeeded by his son and heir, Olav.\n\nElizabeth II has seen three Monarchs in Norway during her 70 year reign: King Haakon VII, King Olav V (1957 \u2013 1991) and King Harald V, who took the throne in 1991.",

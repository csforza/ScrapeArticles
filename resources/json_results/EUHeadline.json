There are about 1,500 Russian troops stationed there. pic.twitter.com/fN4Msmy4Lz \u2014 Simon Ostrovsky (@SimonOstrovsky) April 25, 2022\n\nAccording to a statement by Transnistria\u2019s government and local media reports, there were no reports of casualties.\n\nTransnistria, which demanded recognition of independence earlier in March, is considered under international law to be part of Moldova.\n\nThe statelet, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and hosts Russian troop bases and arms depots, borders western Ukraine.\n\nMoldova\u2019s government said it was \u201cconcerned about the incident\u201d, which it said was aimed at creating tensions in a region it had no control of.\n\n\u201cThe aim of today\u2019s incident is to create pretexts for straining the security situation in the Transnistrian region, which is not controlled by the constitutional authorities,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn the past weeks, Russian forces have advanced to cut off Ukraine\u2019s access to the sea \u2013 a move interpreted by Western military experts as an attempt to create a land corridor from Russia-controlled Donbas, over Crimea to Transnistria.\n\nRussian general says Moscow aim is to leave Ukraine as a landlocked country A Russian general declared on that Moscow wants to seize all of southern and eastern Ukraine, as it presses on with a new offensive after its campaign to capture the capital Kyiv collapsed last month.\n\nMoscow is planning to seize Ukraine\u2019s south and open a route to Moldova\u2019s Transnistria region, as part of the \u201csecond phase\u201d of its military operation, Russia\u2019s Central Military District (CFD) command said last week.\n\n\u201cControl over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Trans-Dniester,\u201d Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of the CFD, said in a statement carried by TASS and Interfax.\n\nMinnekayev then claimed there was evidence of \u201coppression\u201d of the Russian-speaking population there, an allegation Russia has previously used in relation to claims of oppression of Russian minorities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine as grounds for military action.\n\nUkrainian officials, meanwhile, have warned Russia could potentially use the region to launch attacks into western Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOur working assumption is that Moldova is not a target for military action and [we] see no reason why we would be attacked,\u201d the country\u2019s foreign minister Nicu Popescu told EURACTIV last month.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we as a government have a duty to be preparing for the full spectrum of scenarios \u2013 and that, of course, includes negative scenarios,\u201d he said.\n\nMoldova puts its hope in EU membership, although it has not followed Ukraine and Georgia in demanding NATO accession. Most of Moldovans speak Romanian and Russian, and reportedly half of them have obtained Romanian passports.\n\n(Edited by Georgi Gotev)",

President Aleksander Vucic has also stopped short of condemning the invasion of Ukraine. Several pro-Russia demonstrations have also taken place in the capital of Belgrade over the last two months.\n\nBulgarian media quoted a government official who said the plane will transport the Russian diplomats who have been declared personae non grata in various EU countries and have been unable to return to Russia due to lack of flights.",

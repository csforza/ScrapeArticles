# A Tool To Scrape Global News Articles and Output Them Into JSON

This is just a tool I made for a website I have that scrapes articles, extracts information and then groups the articles based on a similarity score.  It also calculates the polarity and subjectivity of each article as well.

The more articles per group per region, the more likely they will be seen on my website.

Not the most algorithmic of scripts, but I does a good job of delivering the most relevant news of the day.

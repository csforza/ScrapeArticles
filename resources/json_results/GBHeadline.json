        "text": "Boris Johnson Urged to Help Free British Fighters Captured in Ukraine\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been urged to help free two British nationals who were captured by Russia when fighting in Mariupol.\n\nThe family of Aiden Aslin told a British TV broadcaster on Monday that they hope Johnson will help and have something \u201csorted out\u201d so the 28-year-old and his fellow Briton, 48-year-old Shaun Pinner, can be returned to their families.\n\nThe UK government said it\u2019s in touch with the two families to support them. It also condemned the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes and called for anyone detained to be treated humanely in accordance with the requirements of international humanitarian law.\n\nAslin, originally from Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, north England, and Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, east England, are both members of the Ukrainian armed forces. The families said they have both been in Ukraine since 2018, long before the Russian invasion of the eastern European country.\n\nThe pair were captured earlier this month after their unit had to surrender after 48 days of defending Mariupol as they were \u201crunning out of ammunition.\u201d\n\nThey later appeared on Russian state TV, asking Johnson to help exchange for them with Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who was arrested by the Ukrainian secret services on April 12. It\u2019s not clear if they were under duress.\n\nBoth appeared to have bruises and Aslin appeared to have been beaten. Their families later said they were in contact with the UK\u2019s Foreign Office to ensure the Russian authorities \u201cmeet their obligations to prisoners of war under international law.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry on April 21 said \u201cthe Russian side [was] taking care of them,\u201d and they were \u201cfed, watered, and given the necessary assistance. Just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained.\u201d\n\nA Russian national flag flies by destroyed buildings in Mariupol, Ukraine, on April 12, 2022. (Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe UK government advises against reporting on specific individuals as this may impact their safety. The International Committee of the Red Cross also recommends not publishing images that identify prisoners of war, or show them in humiliating or degrading situations unless there\u2019s a \u201ccompelling public interest\u201d in doing so in accordance with the Geneva Convention.\n\nBut Aslin\u2019s mother Angela and his brother Nathan spoke to TalkTV on Monday, pleading for Johnson\u2019s help. Pinner\u2019s family also previously released a statement through the FCDO, rebuking Russian media\u2019s characterisation of foreign fighters in the Ukrainian military as \u201cmercenaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope that, at some point, there will be a prisoner swap. However, it\u2019s out of my hands. It is between Ukraine and Russia,\u201d Nathan Aslin told TalkTV.\n\nOutlining his recent phone conversation with his brother, Nathan Aslin told the broadcaster, \u201cIt was obvious that he was with the Russian people that were holding him and he was asking for me to contact Boris [Johnson] to get this prison swap done. And to keep on asking for this swap.\u201d\n\nAsked what he would say to the prime minister, Nathan said: \u201cAct now when you got the time to act. You\u2019ve got two British citizens on the line, being forced to say whatever the Russians are putting in [their] mouths at gunpoint, whether they show it on the camera or not. And it\u2019s a moral obligation to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAngela Aslin added: \u201cI would like to hope that Boris will help. And talk to the Ukraine government [and] embassy. There can be something sorted out so that these two guys can come home.\u201d\n\nAslin moved to Ukraine in 2018 with his Ukrainian fianc\u00e9e and now holds British and Ukrainian citizenship. He previously fought the ISIS terrorist group with Kurdish militia People\u2019s Defense Units in Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nPinner\u2019s family previously said that the former British Army soldier decided to relocate to Ukraine in 2019 \u201cto use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Pinner \u201cenjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country\u201d where he also met his Ukrainian wife.\n\nForeign Office minister James Cleverly on Tuesday confirmed that Aslin and Pinner should be treated as prisoners of war.\n\nAsked about the pair by Aslin\u2019s local MP\u2014former housing minister Robert Jenrick\u2014Cleverly told Parliament he had discussed the issue of foreign volunteer fighters with the Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201cThey are clear, and we are clear, that those fighting under the Ukrainian flag for the Ukrainian armed forces in the defence of Ukraine should be treated as Ukrainian military and as prisoners of war, with all the protections that the international humanitarian law affords to those individuals,\u201d Cleverly said.\n\nThe UK government advises against all travel to Ukraine.",

But if it is not reciprocal, it does not help the negotiation process,\" he said.\n\nUS ambassadors and consuls will return to Kyiv\n\nBlinken confirmed that US diplomats withdrawn from Ukraine at the start of the Russian invasion would gradually return to Kyiv.

There are various causes of hepatitis, including viral infections and alcohol consumption,\u201d said Dr Stephanie Ooi, a GP at the MyHealthcare Clinic in London.\n\n\u201cSome cases of hepatitis will resolve with no ongoing issues; however, there are certain cases that can be longer lasting, and cause more serious damage to the liver, and affect liver function.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NHS, hepatitis E \u2013 caused by the hepatitis E virus \u2013 is the most common cause of short-term (acute) hepatitis in the UK.\n\n\u2013 What are the symptoms?\n\nSymptoms may include feeling sick, a high temperature and tiredness (Alamy/PA)\n\nAccording to the NHS, short-term (acute) hepatitis often has no noticeable symptoms, so you may not realise you have it.\n\nIf you do experience symptoms, Dr Ooi said: \u201cYou may notice a high temperature, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), fever, generally feeling unwell, dark-coloured urine and pale-coloured stool. In addition you may have tummy pain, have a reduced appetite and itchy skin.\u201d\n\nThe NHS lists muscle and joint pain and feeling unusually tired all the time as further symptoms.\n\n\u2013 What should parents and carers do?\n\n\u201cThe number of cases of hepatitis in children is increasing, which is understandably causing some concern amongst parents,\u201d said Dr Ooi. \u201cThe best thing to do is to see your GP if you notice any of the above symptoms, and are worried about hepatitis.\n\n\u201cSome of the symptoms can present in other conditions, so it does not necessarily mean your child has hepatitis \u2013 but jaundice in particular needs to be urgently highlighted to a doctor.\u201d\n\nSince the start of the year, 111 children have required hospital treatment for hepatitis (Peter Byrne/PA) (PA Wire)\n\nDr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said: \u201cNormal hygiene measures such as thorough handwashing (including supervising children) and good thorough respiratory hygiene, help to reduce the spread of many common infections, including adenovirus.\n\n\u201cChildren experiencing symptoms of a gastrointestinal infection, including vomiting and diarrhoea, should stay at home and not return to school or nursery until 48 hours after the symptoms have stopped.\u201d\n\n\u2013 What are the treatment options?\n\nDr Ooi said: \u201cThe treatment will depend on what is causing the hepatitis, so this will vary. Your child will be assessed and monitored and have any further tests that need to be done.\n\n\u201cTreatment will also be based on symptoms, i.e. giving adequate pain relief if they are in pain or feeling uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nIn very serious cases, sufferers might need a liver transplant.",

One avenue of inquiry being explored is that the outbreak may be linked to a surge in common viral infections after COVID-19 restrictions were phased out. Children who weren\u2019t exposed to adenovirus over the last two years may now be getting hit harder when they are exposed to the viruses.\n\n\u201cInformation gathered through our investigations increasingly suggests that this rise in sudden onset hepatitis in children is linked to adenovirus infection,\u201d said Dr. Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA. \u201cHowever, we are thoroughly investigating other potential causes.\u201d\n\nThe British health agency said in a briefing Monday that there may be \u201ca cofactor causing a normal adenovirus to produce a more severe clinical presentation in young children.\u201d\n\nThis could be an \u201cincreased susceptibility due to reduced exposure during the pandemic, prior SARS-CoV-2 or other infection, or a yet undiscovered coinfection or toxin,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cAlternatively, there may have been emergence of a novel adenovirus strain with altered characteristics,\u201d UKHSA said.\n\nThe majority of children affected are under the age of 5 and have presented symptoms of gastroenteritis illness\u2014diarrhoea and nausea\u2014as well as jaundice, which is the yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.\n\nUK public health officials have ruled out any links to COVID-19 vaccines, saying none of the affected children were vaccinated.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory last week after children in Alabama were discovered to have adenovirus and hepatitis infections.\n\nThe CDC said that five pediatric patients with significant liver injury, including three with acute liver failure, who also tested positive for adenovirus, were reported to the agency by an Alabama hospital.\n\nThe CDC added that the children were previously healthy and that none had COVID-19.\n\nTwo cases were also identified in North Carolina, health department officials said.\n\nCases have also been found in Denmark, Spain, and the Netherlands, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nJack Phillips and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

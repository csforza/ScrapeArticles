Three British Columbia First Nations said they will work together to investigate the disappearance of indigenous children at the site of the former St. Paul's Indian Residential School in North Vancouver on Tuesday. (Phhoto: Xinhua)\n\nAn indigenous leader on Monday pressed for UN investigations into alleged genocide by the Canadian government in \"residential schools\" for indigenous children.\"The Canadian government established what I call 'institutions of assimilation and genocide.' These institutions were designed to kill the Indian and the child by forbidding them to speak their language, which disconnect them from their families and communities,\" said RoseAnne Archibald, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, an organization for indigenous rights in Canada.\"Some people refer to these institutions as 'residential schools.' I don't call them schools anymore because no school I ever attended had children buried in unmarked graves.Thousands and thousands of our children died in these institutions,\" she told reporters at UN Headquarters in New York after attending a session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.\"I'm calling on the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, along with other special rapporteurs, to conduct full-fledged investigations of the circumstances and responsibilities surrounding these institutions, including full redress, criminal prosecutions and sanctions and other remedies for human rights violations, including genocide.\"\"Canada must not be allowed to investigate itself. Please help us ensure that something like this never happens again, not just to us, but to anyone.\"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is the federal police organization, would come into Indian communities and take children forcibly and they would threaten parents with arrest. How can that organization investigate itself or investigate Canada? It can't, she said.\"Canada's government established those institutions through policies and legislation. How can they possibly be independent and impartial when it shows that they are culpable and guilty of the deaths of our children?\"She said her assembly has written to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and made a formal request for investigations, but has not heard back yet.A number of lawyers went to the International Criminal Court in 2021 to ask for investigations into the possible gross human rights violations with respect to those institutions.The lawyers were turned away, she said.\"I believe that we're gonna continue to press on the ICC to also look at this situation in Canada with respect to our children, who went to those institutions and those children who died in those institutions especially.\"Xinhua",

Over 30,000 names were submitted for consideration to the renaming advisory committee and ultimately 2,600 potiential names were reviewed.\n\nJennifer S. Simpson, the provost and vice-president, academic and chair of the committee said in a press release that through community engagement, they learned there was a \u201cstrong desire\u201d across groups of students, faculty, and alumni for the name to reference a place or location.\n\nIn 2021, the school embarked on a renaming process following years of calls that the university drop its name, which honoured Egerton Ryerson. This also follows a summer of protest by students, advocates and Indigenous leaders which led to the toppling of Ryerson\u2019s statue on Gould St. after the discovery of 215 unmarked graves at a Kamloops residential school in May 2021.\n\nEgerton Ryerson, a Methodist minister and superintendent of schools for Upper Canada, was the architect behind the 1847 Ryerson Report, which laid the foundation for residential schools in Canada.\n\nThe residential school system saw Indigenous children taken from their families in an attempt to assimilate them at national, government-funded Catholic schools that often abused and starved children and lead to thousands of deaths.\n\nLast June, 18 Indigenous faculty at the university wrote an open letter that called on the school to change its name. The letter called for \u201cremoving the face and name of a symbol of oppression, violence and pain.\u201d\n\nOver the last year, more unmarked graves have been identified by authorities across the country, and a process of excavating children\u2019s remains from school sites has begun.\n\n\u201cWhy not? Fantastic name. Wonderful. I am proud to be a part of the generation of Indigenous students, faculty and staff that made this happen. So long, Ryerson,\u201d Hayden King of the Yellowhead Institute at Toronto Metropolitan University tweeted.\n\nIan Mosby, a historian of Indigenous health at the school, also tweeted his support for the new name, calling it \u201cpretty good.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting the university renamed wouldn't have happened without decades of organizing and struggle by Black and Indigenous students and faculty. I\u2019m grateful for all their work,\u201d he said.\n\nThose who graduated from the school before 2022 can either keep their existing degree that contains the \u201cRyerson\u201d name or request a reissue of the degree that bears the Toronto Metropolitan name.\n\nThe Ryerson University Act must be officially amended before changes to degrees can be made, according to the school\u2019s website. The act is provincial legislation that allow the university to operate.\n\nToronto Metropolitan University has also collaborated with LinkedIn to allow alumni to change the school\u2019s name on their profile within a few days after the name change announcement.\n\nPrevious corporate and public names of the university are: Ryerson Institute of Technology in 1948, Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in 1964 and Ryerson Polytechnic University in 1993, which was shortened to Ryerson University in 2002.\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:",

What they have to understand is if Quebec is bilingual, unfortunately the attraction in North America to English will be so strong it will be a matter of time before we don\u2019t speak French in Quebec and we become Louisiana.\u201d Legault was commenting on news that two new minority language rights parties, one to be called the Canadian Party of Quebec (CaPQ) and the other Mouvement Qu\u00e9bec, are getting organized in time to field candidates in the fall general election. Neither have been officially authorized by \u00c9lections Quebec, but have applications to obtain official party status. Both plan to run candidates throughout Quebec, but are targeting ridings in Montreal, the Townships and Outaouais because of the pockets of English-speaking Quebecers.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The announcement of the creation of the Canadian Party of Quebec was done via a press release published overnight Monday by Eastern Townships language activist Colin Standish. Former mayoralty candidate Balarama Holness announced last week that he was creating Mouvement Qu\u00e9bec. \u201cYes, the Canadian Party of Quebec/Parti canadien du Qu\u00e9bec will be an unapologetically federalist party that tirelessly works for minority rights, socioeconomic justice and linguistic harmony,\u201d Standish said. The party\u2019s platform will be based on six principles. They will be \u201crights are rights are rights, respecting the integrity of the Canadian constitution, bilingualism, educational choice, prosperity for all Quebecers, and rapprochement and reconciliation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The group says it intends to challenge what it describes as Quebec\u2019s political orthodoxy and offers to \u201cfill the void\u201d felt by minority voters in the wake of overhauls of language legislation at the National Assembly (Bill 96) and in Ottawa and other legislation, such as Bill 21 on state secularism. \u201cThe time has come to offer a voice to the voiceless,\u201d especially Quebecers who feel betrayed and abandoned by the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec and the Quebec Liberal Party,\u201d Standish said. The news took the traditional parties by surprise, but mostly risks rocking the boat of the struggling Liberals. With Liberal Leader Dominique Anglade absent from the legislature for a speaking engagement Tuesday, it was up to Liberal house leader Andr\u00e9 Fortin to field the questions. He rapidly shifted the Liberal line of attack to a warning about vote-splitting.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cYou may well end up with more people elected from the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec,\u201d Fortin told reporters. \u201cIf you want people here, in the assembly, who represent your views, if you want people who oppose those bills, then the Liberal Party represents your views.\u201d Reached Tuesday, Holness launched a few arrows at the new party, which will now be competing for similar voters with his party. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether Montrealers will be inspired by Colin,\u201d Holness said. \u201cI think their policies are connected to the current political climate, but are they connected to the people? I don\u2019t think so. \u201cHe\u2019s from the Eastern Townships, has never lived in Montreal and won\u2019t be campaigning in Montreal because he doesn\u2019t live here.

We have our plan. We\u2019re confident. This is not a fly-by-night idea for us. It is intellectually and morally and legally sound principles.\u201d He challenged Legault\u2019s views that French is in decline, noting 80 per cent of Quebecers are mother-tongue-French. \u201cThe decline of French in Quebec is a myth,\u201d Standish said.

Try refreshing your browser, or One of the criticisms of the order establishing the inquiry, though, is that it allows the government to refuse publicly release documents or information based on national security concerns. The order also instructs the inquiry to look into the conduct of the protesters, but not the government. Mendicino responded to that claim by saying that \u201cthe judge can look into the conduct of police enforcement.\u201d The conduct of police is a far cry from looking into the actions or the failures of federal, provincial and municipal politicians.

In order to do that, Justice Rouleau needs access to documents covered by cabinet confidence,\u201d Chong said. \u201cWill the Prime Minister, will the government, waive cabinet confidence?\u201d Mendicino, a former Crown prosecutor, reminded the Commons that people were arrested as a result of these protests. What he didn\u2019t say was that no one has faced charges that required the Emergencies Act. He also spoke of working \u201cin co-operation with the judge\u201d leading the inquiry without saying that the government would grant full access to documents. Last week, the Trudeau government cited cabinet confidence in refusing to release documents in defence of a lawsuit over the use of the Emergencies Act.\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nYour Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

Try refreshing your browser, or CN says search for francophone, Quebec-based director has begun Back to video Canadian National Railway said Tuesday it\u2019s begun a search for a francophone Quebec-based board member after sparking controversy for failing to nominate a single French-speaking director. The new board member will be appointed \u201cin the coming months\u201d following a \u201crigorous process,\u201d Canada\u2019s largest railroad said Tuesday in a statement. This will be in addition to CN\u2019s new Canadian-born chief executive, Tracy Robinson, a three-decade industry veteran who recently relocated to Montreal after being hired in late January. As a former crown corporation until its privatization in 1995, Montreal-based CN is subject to Canada\u2019s Official Languages Act \u2014 though the legislation doesn\u2019t govern the company\u2019s board.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cCN, headquartered in Montreal for over 100 years, and its Board of Directors, is very proud of and respects the company\u2019s rich history in Quebec, where the official language is French,\u201d chairman Robert Pace said in the statement. CN\u2019s board slate for 2022, disclosed in a regulatory filing last week, includes several former railroad executives, none of whom are based in Quebec. The move drew scorn from the $420-billion Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, a major CN shareholder, which criticized the company for ignoring qualified francophone candidates based in its home province. Language skills of CEOs at major Quebec-based companies have become a sensitive issue after Air Canada boss \u2014 and native English speaker \u2014 Michael Rousseau told reporters in November it was a \u201ctestament to Montreal\u201d that he could live here without speaking French. Rousseau had earlier delivered an English-only speech to the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Canada\u2019s biggest railroad had planned to have at least one francophone director in 2022, but political events decided otherwise. CN appointed Jean Charest as independent director in January, only for the former Quebec premier to resign April 1 when he decided to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. Board makeup is quickly turning into a political issue. Companies that are subject to the Official Languages Act, such as CN and Air Canada, should be forced by Ottawa to have a minimum proportion of francophone directors, Conservative Party official languages critic Jo\u00ebl Godin said Tuesday. \u201cWe must have a tool to force federally chartered companies to have francophones,\u201d said Godin, who is vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages,.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The Conservatives are preparing an amendment to the bill that aims to modernize the Official Languages Act, Godin also said. Lawmakers are currently debating the minimum proportion of francophones and the mechanism to impose this requirement. Godin\u2019s position is consistent with that of the chair of the official languages committee, Liberal MP Ren\u00e9 Arseneault. Businesses subject to the Official Languages Act, \u201cno matter how independent,\u201d should represent \u201cthe linguistic demographics of the country,\u201d said Arseneault, who represents the Madawaska-Restigouche riding. This would mean making it mandatory that \u201cat the very least\u201d a quarter of board of members be francophone. Issues surrounding the use of French at CN go beyond the boardroom.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Officials at the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference wrote to Robinson earlier this month to highlight \u201cmultiple problems regarding the use and quality of the French language in the workplace,\u201d La Presse reported last week. Employees who say they\u2019re uncomfortable working in in English \u201care subject to pressure, threats of disciplinary action and a treatment that could sometimes amount to retaliation,\u201d the union said in its letter. Separately, CN said Tuesday that adjusted diluted profit rose seven per cent in the first quarter to $1.32 a share. Quarterly revenue advanced five per cent to $3.71 billion. Citing \u201cchallenging\u201d operating conditions and \u201cworldwide economic uncertainty,\u201d CN also cut its full-year financial outlook. Adjusted diluted profit for 2022 is now expected to rise by 15 per cent to 20 per cent, the company said, down from an earlier target of 20 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Robinson addressed the language situation on a late-afternoon call with financial analysts, her first since taking over \u2014 and even spent a couple of minutes reading a statement in heavily accented French. The new CEO said she\u2019s been practicing her French since moving to Montreal two months ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for me and for CN,\u201d Robinson said in French. \u201cI want to make sure that anyone can communicate with CN in the official language of their choice. It\u2019s also important for us to have francophone directors.\u201d Robinson concluded her prepared remarks by thanking her predecessor, Quebecer Jean-Jacques Ruest, for his 25 years of service at CN and his \u201cexemplary leadership.\u201d \u201cMerci beaucoup JJ,\u201d she said.

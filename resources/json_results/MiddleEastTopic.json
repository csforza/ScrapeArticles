On Saturday, the main crossing between the two countries at Islam Qala-Dogarun was closed for a day after a dispute erupted between Afghan forces, who were paving a road, and Iranian border guards, who obstructed the work.\n\nThe Taliban seized an Iranian military vehicle they claimed had crossed into Afghanistan. As a result, the two countries put their forces along the border on high alert, but the next day the situation returned to normal.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t unconcerned about our borders. The tensions on Saturday were triggered by a misunderstanding,\u201d said Enayatullah Khawarazmi, a spokesman for the Afghan Defence Ministry.\n\nThis is the second skirmish between the two countries since the Taliban took power in August last year.\n\nThe Iranian government is also very concerned about the security situation in Afghanistan following attacks on a Shia mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif and a Hazara school in Kabul, claimed by the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (IS-K), the local affiliate of the Islamic State group.\n\nA spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Saeed Khatibzadeh, yesterday said that the Taliban are unable to protect Afghan citizens, in particular Shias; for this reason, Tehran offered to lead the fight against terrorist groups and IS-K.\n\nIran President Ebrahim Raisi is quoted as saying that \u201cIran is ready to cooperate and use all its means to counter the threat of Takfiri terrorism and prevent recurrence of these tragedies.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian embassy in Kabul noted that diplomatic efforts to develop a friendly relationship between the two countries will continue after Ramadan.\n\nAlthough Iran has not yet officially recognised the Taliban regime, it has accepted the appointment of three new Taliban officials at the Afghan embassy in Tehran.",

Try refreshing your browser, or Alleged Montreal Mafioso not allowed inside bar in Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies Back to video The 60-day suspension is part of an agreement reached between the R\u00e9gie des alcools, des courses et des jeux (RACJ) and the new owner of the 6e avenue Bar et Grill on Maurice Duplessis Blvd. As part of the agreement, the new owner agreed to not allow Marco Pizzi, 52, and four members of his family to enter the premises. Police sources have described Pizzi as a man who appears to have grown in influence among the Montreal Mafia over the past decade. The agreement reached with the new owner is detailed in a decision made on April 14 by the RACJ to suspend the bar\u2019s liquor licence despite the change in ownership. It describes how the previous owner was summoned to appear before the board since November 2019 on a request from the Montreal police.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cThe most troubling aspect in the case (was) the presence and the hold, by certain individuals tied to the highest spheres of organized crime in Montreal, over control of the establishment,\u201d Marc Savard, the president of the RACJ, wrote in his decision approving the agreement. Savard noted that a Montreal police investigator corroborated the new owner\u2019s testimony that he has no connections with Salvatore Infantino, the bar\u2019s previous owner, beyond the sale of the bar, and has no ties to organized crime. Infantino is also among the names of eight people who are not allowed on the premises. During the summer of 2016, Pizzi underwent a bail hearing at the Montreal courthouse following his arrest in Project Clemenza, an RCMP investigation into alleged drug traffickers tied to the Montreal Mafia. Infantino testified during the bail hearing in support of Pizzi\u2019s release. He described himself as a childhood friend of Pizzi\u2019s and told the court he was surprised to learn Pizzi was alleged to have been tied to $2.3 million used to finance five shipments of cocaine that were to be smuggled into Canada.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The charges against Pizzi were dropped a year later when the Crown decided it would no longer prosecute cases related to Project Clemenza. Shortly after he was released on bail, an attempt was made on Pizzi\u2019s life on Aug. 8, 2016, while he was driving along Grande-All\u00e9e Ave. in Montreal. A hit man who became an informant and testified during the murder trial of Marie-Jos\u00e9e Viau and Guy Dion last year said that Pizzi was among a list of people that Salvatore Scoppa, the leader of a Calabrian clan in the Montreal Mafia, had sought to have killed. Among a long list of events the Montreal police cited when it asked that Infantino appear before the RACJ, was a dinner held on May 29, 2021, at a restaurant in Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies called Prima Luna \u201cwhere several influential members of organized crime gathered for a soir\u00e9e.\u201d The gathering was held in the restaurant in contravention of COVID-19 measures. Pizzi was reportedly in attendance that night as well as Montreal Mafia leader Francesco Del Balso and longtime members of the Hells Angels. The owners of Prima Luna are scheduled to have a hearing before the RACJ next month to answer questions about the gathering. Other events mentioned include an arson fire set in the same building on Maurice Duplessis Blvd. in 2016, when the business was known as Caf\u00e9 Liana, and an attempted murder on Feb. 4, 2019. pcherry@postmedia.com More On This Topic Man involved in hit on alleged Montreal Mafioso is denied parole Informant says Scoppa brothers wanted to eliminate Sicilians in Montreal Mafia\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nMontreal Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

A nationwide truce brokered by the UN has been underway since the beginning of the month. The prisoner swap could include 16 Saudi nationals and a brother of the Yemeni former President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, according to Reuters. The civil war broke out in late 2014 when the Houthis seized control of several provinces and forced Hadi\u2019s Saudi-backed government out of Sanaa. Since then, tens of thousands of people have been killed, 4 million have been displaced, and much of the population has been pushed to starvation, according to the UN.",

But he said that efforts had been derailed by claims of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv.\n\n\"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian Army had nothing to do with,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin also agreed \"in principle\" to UN and Red Cross involvement in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in Ukraine's Mariupol, the United Nations said in a statement.\n\n\"Follow-on discussions will be had with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Russian Defense Ministry,\" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement after Putin\u2019s meeting with Guterres.\n\nRecent attempts to set up humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians have failed.\n\nDuring the meeting, Guterres criticized Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine as a flagrant violation of its neighbor\u2019s territorial integrity. He also urged Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians trapped in the steel mill.\n\nPutin responded by claiming that the Russian forces had offered humanitarian corridors but said the Ukrainian defenders of the plant were using civilians as shields and not allowing them to leave.\n\nBefore meeting the Russian president, Guterres had earlier talked with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and told him he was concerned about reports of possible war crimes in Ukraine and that independent investigations are needed.\n\nHe also said that the United Nations was ready to fully mobilize the world body's resources to save lives and evacuate people from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\n\n\nThe sprawling steel complex at Azovstal has remained the last bulwark of Ukrainian resistance the strategic port on the Sea of Azov .\n\nUkrainian officials have said that up to 1,000 civilians have sheltered in the maze of underground tunnels there. They have repeatedly urged Russia to offer them a safe exit, but previous attempts at organizing evacuations have failed repeatedly.\n\nMeanwhile, as Russian forces pounded eastern Ukraine on April 26, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised to \u201ckeep moving heaven and earth\u201d to get Kyiv the weapons it needs to repel the new offensive.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Putin has shown no seriousness about diplomacy to end the war despite a series of international efforts.\n\n\"We've seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations,\" Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 26.\n\nHe noted that in talks with Russia ahead of the February 24 invasion it became clear that Putin's complaints about Ukraine entering NATO were only a pretext for the invasion.\n\n\"It is abundantly clear -- in President Putin's own words -- that this was never about Ukraine being potentially part of NATO and it was always about his belief that Ukraine does not deserve to be a sovereign, independent country,\" Blinken said.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.\n\nFighting continued on April 26 in eastern Ukraine, where the city of Kreminna in the Luhansk region has reportedly fallen to the Russians.\n\nStreet-to-street fighting had been going on for days in Kreminna, with civilian evacuations there made impossible by the war, the British Ministry of Defense said on Twitter on April 26.\n\nThe British report said heavy fighting was under way in the south of the city of Izyum, as Russian forces try to advance toward the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defenses in Zaporizhzhya in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south,\" it added in the regular bulletin, also saying that Russian troops were likely to attempt to encircle Ukrainian Army's heavily fortified positions in the east.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that more help for Ukraine was on the way, as he convened a meeting of officials from around 40 countries at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany to pledge more weapons.\n\n\"This gathering reflects the galvanized world,\" Austin said in his opening remarks .He added that he wanted officials to leave the meeting \u201cwith a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine\u2019s near-term security requirements because we\u2019re going to keep moving heaven and earth so that we can meet them.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Austin said in a press conference that the forum would continue as a monthly contact group that would discuss Ukraine's defense needs.\n\n\"The contact group will be a vehicle for nations of goodwill to intensify our efforts, coordinate our assistance, and focus on winning today's fight and the struggles to come,\" Austin said.\n\nAustin also praised a decision by Germany, which said it had cleared the way for the delivery of Gepard antiaircraft guns to Ukraine.\n\nAustin -- who visited Ukraine with Blinken over the weekend and announced an extra $700 million in military aid to Ukraine -- said Washington wants to see \"Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,\" adding that Kyiv can still win the war if given the right support.\n\nThe United States has sent some $4 billion in military aid since President Joe Biden's term began last year, and already announced a new $800 million aid package last week.\n\nLavrov said late on April 25 that Western arms shipments to Ukraine mean that NATO is essentially engaging in war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy, and weapons delivered to Ukraine from the West will be \"legitimate targets\" for the Russian military.\n\nLavrov also warned of the threat of a third world war and said there was a \"considerable\" risk of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons.\n\n\"The danger is serious, it is real, it must not be underestimated,\" Lavrov said.\n\nBut Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Lavrov's comments are meant to just \"scare the world off supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nEarlier, Russia's ambassador in Washington told the United States to halt arms shipments, warning that large Western deliveries of weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nWith reporting by AP, AFP, BBC, and Reuters",

Another Palestinian journalist, Yasser Mortaja, was killed on the spot by an Israeli military sniper\u2019s bullet while covering the protest on 6 April 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weekly protests were launched on 30 March 2018 to denounce the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and to demand the \u201cright of return\u201d of Palestinian refugees. The protests have been held every Friday since then in the Gaza Strip, and even in the West Bank, and have been systematically covered by reporters on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an RSF tally, at least 144 Palestinian journalists have been at the receiving end of live rounds, rubber bullets, stun grenades or teargas fired by Israeli soldiers or police \u2013 or their baton blows \u2013 in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the past four years of \u201cGreat March of Return\u201d protests.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose badly injured include Youssef al-Kronz, a freelance photographer who was hit in both legs by shots fired by Israeli soldiers during the first protest on 30 March 2018 and had to undergo partial amputation of his left leg.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo journalists were totally or partially blinded in one eye. One was Yahya Khalid, a journalist with the Palestine Today News agency, whose left eye was injured by bullet fragments on 19 October 2018. The other was Al-Aqsa TV\u2019s Sami Misran, who was blinded in his left eye by a bullet fragment on 13 July 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nAli Jadallah, a reporter for the Turkish news agency Anadolu, sustained a serious head injury when hit by a rubber bullet on 30 August 2019. It was the third time he had been targeted since the start of the protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPalestinian journalists are still taking serious risks after four years of tirelessly covering the Great March of Return demonstrations every Friday,\u201d said RSF\u2019s Middle East desk. \u201cThese reporters find themselves caught up in the repressive measures used by the security forces against the protesters, and are sometimes injured, often deliberately, when they are just going their job to cover events.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2018, after the two deaths and many injuries, RSF asked the International Criminal Court to investigate what it regarded as war crimes against Palestinian journalists covering protests. In March 2021, then ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced that there were sufficient grounds for initiating an official investigation. But nothing has been announced since then.\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the physical violence by Israeli soldiers and police during the Friday protests, RSF has also noted two surges in violence against Palestinian journalists: during the military offensive in the Gaza Strip in May 2021 following the expulsion of Palestinian residents in Sheikh Jarrah (East Jerusalem), and the current tension linked to the month of Ramadan and the clashes on the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael is ranked 86th out of 180 countries in RSF's World Press Freedom Index, while Palestine is ranked 132nd.",

        "text": "A Turkish court on Monday sentenced prominent Turkish civil rights activist and philanthropist Osman Kavala to life in prison without parole, finding him guilty of attempting to overthrow the government in connection with mass anti-government protests in 2013.\n\nThe court in Istanbul also sentenced seven other defendants, including 71-year-old architect Mucella Yapici, to 18 years in prison each for \"aiding\" the attempt. It ordered that the activists who were not in custody be immediately arrested, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\n\nThe verdict, which is likely to harm Turkey's ties with Western nations, comes as Europe's top human rights body, the Council of Europe, launched infringement procedures against Turkey for refusing to abide by a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which called for Kavala's release on grounds that his rights had been violated.\n\nKavala, 64, has been jailed in Silivri prison, on the outskirts of Istanbul, since he was detained on Oct. 18, 2017, and accused of financing the protests. He and other defendants denied all of the accusations and are expected to appeal the verdicts.\n\nHuman rights groups say Kavala was prosecuted with flimsy evidence and that the case is politically motivated.\n\n'Justice did not prevail'\n\nSupporters of Kavala and the seven other defendants immediately protested the verdicts on Monday, shouting slogans in support of the 2013 protests that morphed from a dispute over building a mall in an Istanbul park into wider demonstrations against the government of then-prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nOzgur Ozel, an opposition legislator whose party frequently questions the independence of Turkey's courts, accused the judiciary of allegedly meeting the wishes of Erdogan, who is now president.\n\n\"Justice did not prevail here today \u2014 the will of the person who rules this country was carried out,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\nOzel also denounced the trial as an attempt by Erdogan to \"demonize the protests that were extremely peaceful and were staged out of environmental concerns.\"\n\nKavala calls ruling an 'assassination'\n\nAsked for his final words in court on Monday, Kavala said: \"The aggravated life sentence demanded against me is an assassination that cannot be explained through legal reasons,\" according to the Media and Law Studies Association group, which has been monitoring the trial.\n\nIn his defence statements on Friday, Kavala rejected the accusations once again, insisting that he had merely taken pastries and face masks to the protesters. He said allegations that he directed the protests are \"not plausible.\"\n\nLawyers, opposition legislators and supporters gathered on Monday in front of the Caglayan Justice Palace in Istanbul as the court held a hearing for Kavala and 15 others. (Dilara Senkaya/Reuters)\n\n\"The fact that I spent 4.5 years of my life in prison is an irreparable loss for me. My only consolation is the possibility that my experience will contribute to a better understanding of the grave problems of the judiciary,\" Kavala told the court by video conference from Silivri.\n\nU.S. condemns conviction\n\nThe United States said it was \"deeply troubled and disappointed\" by the conviction, calling it \"unjust\" and \"inconsistent with respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.\"\n\n\"We again call on Turkey to release Osman Kavala,\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement.\n\n\"We remain gravely concerned by the continued judicial harassment of civil society, media, political and business leaders in Turkey.\"\n\nKavala is the founder of a non-profit organization, Anadolu Kultur, which focuses on cultural and artistic projects promoting peace and dialogue.\n\nKavala was initially acquitted in February 2020 of charges that connected him with the 2013 Gezi Park protests. As supporters awaited his release, Kavala was rearrested on new charges linking him to Turkey's 2016 coup attempt. The acquittal was later overturned, and the case was merged with that relating to the coup attempt, which the Turkish government blames on the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies any links to the attempted coup.\n\nThe court on Monday acquitted Kavala of charges linked to the coup attempt, saying there was insufficient evidence, Anadolu reported.\n\nIn October, Kavala's continued detention sparked a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and 10 Western countries, including the United States, France and Germany, after they called for his release on the fourth anniversary of his imprisonment.\n\nErdogan has accused Kavala, of being the \"Turkish branch\" of billionaire U.S. philanthropist George Soros, whom the Turkish leader alleges has been behind insurrections in many countries. He has threatened to expel Western envoys for meddling in Turkey's internal affairs.\n\nKavala, shown speaking at an event in this undated handout photo, was given a life sentence in prison after being accused of attempting to overthrow the Turkish government. (Anadolu Kultur/Reuters)\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights' 2019 decision said Kavala's imprisonment aimed to silence him and other human rights defenders and wasn't supported by evidence of an offence.\n\nThe lengthy infringement process by the Council of Europe, a 47-member bloc that upholds human rights, could lead to the suspension of Turkey's voting rights or membership in the organization.\n\nErdogan has dismissed the infringement process, saying Turkey would not \"recognize those who do not recognize our courts.\" Turkey had argued that Kavala's detention was linked to the 2016 attempted coup and not the previous charges that were reviewed by the European court.",

        "text": "April 26, 2022\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk reached a deal to buy Twitter yesterday for $44 billion in cash. Much of Musk\u2019s plans for the social media platform concern reforming Twitter\u2019s content moderation policies, which have been criticized as restrictive of free speech.\n\nThe acquisition elicited a strong reaction in some Middle Eastern circles, principally in Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nMusk has a history with Saudi Arabia. In 2018, he had a feud with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund over his plans to take his electric car company Tesla private.\n\nMore recently, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of Twitter\u2019s largest shareholders, publicly rebuked Musk\u2019s offer to purchase the company, saying Twitter was worth more. Musk did not respond well, tweeting at the prince about Saudi Arabia\u2019s lack of a free media in response.\n\n\u201cHow much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly & indirectly? What are the Kingdom\u2019s views on journalistic freedom of speech?\u201d Musk asked Talal.\n\nSaudi Arabia has the most Twitter users of any country in the Middle East, with some 25 million Saudis using the platform. Many Saudis commented in response to the news, with some comparing it to his 2015 tweet criticizing then-US presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nA lot of Saudi users were happy about Musk buying Twitter, according to a Saudi-based analyst. Jamal AlTamimi told Al-Monitor, \u201cSaudis as a whole are very happy with the deal because they [believe] Twitter's administration is against them and they think Musk will be more just.\u201d\n\nTamimi added that the Saudi government is not particularly concerned with who owns Twitter \u201cas long as its citizens use it successfully.\u201d\n\nTurkey\n\nMusk also has a history with Turkey, particularly with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Last year, Musk and Erdogan spoke about space exploration and a rocket from Musk\u2019s SpaceX carried the Turkish satellite Turksat 5B into orbit. Musk met Erdogan in Turkey in 2017.\n\nSome pro-government Turkish media outlets praised Musk\u2019s Twitter takeover. Writing in Daily Sabah days before the deal was announced, Melih Altinok mocked Musk\u2019s critics and slammed Twitter\u2019s suspension of Trump and Robert Malone, whose criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines are controversial.\n\n\u201cThey must be thinking that an uncontrolled libertarian like Musk, who already said he would open algorithms and prevent censorship, shouldn\u2019t run Twitter. God forbid then he might even unblock Trump's account!\u201d wrote Altinok.\n\nAfter the deal was reached, Turkish social media commentator Emir Cagdas Pekcetin told Yeni Safak that Musk has a \u201cserious attitude toward a truthful news feed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis positive ties with our president will ensure a cleaner social media news flow in our country,\u201d he said, claiming that Musk will block accounts associated with Turkey\u2019s outlawed Gulenist movement.\n\nTurkey has a history of pushing for censorship on Twitter. In 2020, Turkey led the entire world in court orders sent to Twitter, followed by Russia.\n\nSome Turkish Twitter users pleaded with Musk to stop Twitter from restricting the accounts of some Turkish journalists.",

Common sense always calls on humans to do good and indefinitely put evil aside.\u201d\n\nShe said that volunteer work was considered one of the prominent sources of good deeds because it helped reflect a positive image of society, and revealed its prosperity and how much good morals were spread among its members.\n\n\u201cHur Makkah Volunteer Team has contributed every year and this year to serving the visitors of Makkah\u2019s Grand Mosque. It has helped provide first aid services and organizational services in support of some bodies that were entrusted with ensuring the safety and security of the mosque\u2019s visitors,\u201d she said.\n\nFakirah said that 30,000 pilgrims and visitors had benefitted from the team\u2019s services, while the number of male and female service providers from the team reached 145 people. \u201cThis constitutes a very small portion of what our homeland deserves.\u201d\n\nFakirah said that \u201cour goal is to be rewarded by God for our good deeds until Makkah becomes the first city in the world.\u201d",

Joseph Aoun, the director of Lebanese army intelligence Brig. Gen. Tony Kahwagi and the Commander of the Naval Forces Col. Haitham Dhanawy attended an emergency Cabinet session on Tuesday and gave a detailed presentation of what happened with the boat.\n\nThe army said the boat had left Lebanon\u2019s coast illegally and that the boat\u2019s captain had been trying to evade capture when the collision occurred. They said about 60 people had illegally boarded the boat and were headed to Italy and stressed that the army had nothing to do with the boat capsizing.\n\nBACKGROUND Mikati said that investigations should be conducted quickly and transparently, away from media pressure, and should include details of what happened even before the boat set off.\n\nSeveral survivors have said that a Lebanese military vessel rammed the boat, leading it to sink. They said a security official aboard threatened to drown them if they did not comply and return to shore. They said the majority of those who were trying to escape did not know how to swim, including women and children.\n\nLebanese President Michel Aoun said at the beginning of the Cabinet session: \u201cWhat happened in Tripoli hurt us all,\u201d adding that the court must investigate the incident amid conflicting stories, to clarify the truth, and put an end to any contradictory interpretations or explanations.\n\nAhmed Tamer, director of Tripoli port, said the search to find the missing passengers was ongoing and that a Greek frigate was taking part in the operation.\n\nDr. Khaldoun Al-Sherif, a political analyst from Tripoli, told Arab News: \u201cThe conflicting stories urged Mikati to insist on knowing what happened before the boat\u2019s departure. The army says that it spotted the boat before it went out to sea but was unable to catch up and intercepted it when it was at sea. There is a missing link and an inconsistent narrative. The investigation should have started immediately and everything happening now is a waste of time.\u201d\n\nIn Beirut, people continued to protest against a controversial capital control bill. Adopting a capital control law is one of the reforms requested by the International Monetary Fund to help the crisis-hit country.\n\nDepositors blocked the roads leading to parliament on Tuesday to stop the joint parliamentary committees from continuing their discussions over the bill and successfully prevented MPs from achieving a quorum to hold the session.\n\nGeorge Adwan, head of the Administration and Justice Committee, called for rescheduling the capital control discussions until after the May 15 parliamentary elections. He stressed the need for a complete and comprehensive recovery plan that explained losses and their distribution according to responsibilities and the method for paying off losses.\n\n\u201cSuccessive governments and corrupt political officials are to blame along with the Banque du Liban, which is an accomplice to the state\u2019s policies,\u201d he added. \u201cSo why should we hold citizens and depositors responsible for all this? Any recovery plan must tell people how the economic, financial, and monetary situation will improve and how we will create growth and preserve the banking system after fixing the loopholes, instead of hiding behind what the IMF requested to grant Lebanon $3 billion over three years.\u201d",

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let\u2019s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto\u2026 even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn\u2019t \u201cscience\u201d wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can\u2019t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can\u2019t \u201cput others at risk\u201d by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly\u2026work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though \u2026 they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau\u2019s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become \u201cregressive\u201d as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident \u2013 if not cringeworthy \u2013 tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent \u2013 even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can\u2019t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy\u2019s shoes. Simply put, he is insecure and projecting.\n\n\u2014 Article continues below Petition \u2014 PETITION: Ask Elon Musk to REINSTATE LifeSite's Twitter accounts Show Petition Text 0 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled \"free speech absolutist,\" Mr. Musk's entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a \u2018transgender woman\u2019 (Assistant Secretary of Health, 'Rachel' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such \u201chate speech\u201d against Levine, according to Twitter\u2019s \"rules.\" It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for \"the future of civlization.\" LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the \"truth shall make you free.\" (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter's public square. Thank you for SIGNING and SHARING this petition to Elon Musk, urging him to now reinstate LifeSiteNews' suspended Twitter accounts.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don\u2019t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn\u2019t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest \u2013 but they didn\u2019t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular amongst Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end, but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even amongst his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nPresently we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remember that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment after years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared to Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(Phhoto: Xinhua)\n\nAn indigenous leader on Monday pressed for UN investigations into alleged genocide by the Canadian government in "residential schools" for indigenous children."The Canadian government established what I call \'institutions of assimilation and genocide.\' These institutions were designed to kill the Indian and the child by forbidding them to speak their language, which disconnect them from their families and communities," said RoseAnne Archibald, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, an organization for indigenous rights in Canada."Some people refer to these institutions as \'residential schools.\' I don\'t call them schools anymore because no school I ever attended had children buried in unmarked graves.Thousands and thousands of our children died in these institutions," she told reporters at UN Headquarters in New York after attending a session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues."I\'m calling on the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, along with other special rapporteurs, to conduct full-fledged investigations of the circumstances and responsibilities surrounding these institutions, including full redress, criminal prosecutions and sanctions and other remedies for human rights violations, including genocide.""Canada must not be allowed to investigate itself. Please help us ensure that something like this never happens again, not just to us, but to anyone."The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is the federal police organization, would come into Indian communities and take children forcibly and they would threaten parents with arrest. How can that organization investigate itself or investigate Canada? It can\'t, she said."Canada\'s government established those institutions through policies and legislation. How can they possibly be independent and impartial when it shows that they are culpable and guilty of the deaths of our children?"She said her assembly has written to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and made a formal request for investigations, but has not heard back yet.A number of lawyers went to the International Criminal Court in 2021 to ask for investigations into the possible gross human rights violations with respect to those institutions.The lawyers were turned away, she said."I believe that we\'re gonna continue to press on the ICC to also look at this situation in Canada with respect to our children, who went to those institutions and those children who died in those institutions especially."Xinhua', 'image': 'https://www.globaltimes.cn/images/gfavicon.ico', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:13:50'}

What they have to understand is if Quebec is bilingual, unfortunately the attraction in North America to English will be so strong it will be a matter of time before we don’t speak French in Quebec and we become Louisiana.” Legault was commenting on news that two new minority language rights parties, one to be called the Canadian Party of Quebec (CaPQ) and the other Mouvement Québec, are getting organized in time to field candidates in the fall general election. Neither have been officially authorized by Élections Quebec, but have applications to obtain official party status. Both plan to run candidates throughout Quebec, but are targeting ridings in Montreal, the Townships and Outaouais because of the pockets of English-speaking Quebecers.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The announcement of the creation of the Canadian Party of Quebec was done via a press release published overnight Monday by Eastern Townships language activist Colin Standish. Former mayoralty candidate Balarama Holness announced last week that he was creating Mouvement Québec. “Yes, the Canadian Party of Quebec/Parti canadien du Québec will be an unapologetically federalist party that tirelessly works for minority rights, socioeconomic justice and linguistic harmony,” Standish said. The party’s platform will be based on six principles. They will be “rights are rights are rights, respecting the integrity of the Canadian constitution, bilingualism, educational choice, prosperity for all Quebecers, and rapprochement and reconciliation.”\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The group says it intends to challenge what it describes as Quebec’s political orthodoxy and offers to “fill the void” felt by minority voters in the wake of overhauls of language legislation at the National Assembly (Bill 96) and in Ottawa and other legislation, such as Bill 21 on state secularism. “The time has come to offer a voice to the voiceless,” especially Quebecers who feel betrayed and abandoned by the Coalition Avenir Québec and the Quebec Liberal Party,” Standish said. The news took the traditional parties by surprise, but mostly risks rocking the boat of the struggling Liberals. With Liberal Leader Dominique Anglade absent from the legislature for a speaking engagement Tuesday, it was up to Liberal house leader André Fortin to field the questions. He rapidly shifted the Liberal line of attack to a warning about vote-splitting.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content “You may well end up with more people elected from the Coalition Avenir Québec,” Fortin told reporters. “If you want people here, in the assembly, who represent your views, if you want people who oppose those bills, then the Liberal Party represents your views.” Reached Tuesday, Holness launched a few arrows at the new party, which will now be competing for similar voters with his party. “It remains to be seen whether Montrealers will be inspired by Colin,” Holness said. “I think their policies are connected to the current political climate, but are they connected to the people? I don’t think so. “He’s from the Eastern Townships, has never lived in Montreal and won’t be campaigning in Montreal because he doesn’t live here. For me, this (other party) is a lot of noise.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content He noted his organization has a track record of being able to organize and debate issues from the last municipal campaign. “Anyone can go and register a party and say we are against Bill 96,” Holness said. “I don’t think they have the bandwidth, the personnel and the credibility to make the kind of impact Mouvement Montréal had.” Later, in an interview with the Montreal Gazette, Standish said he did not want to get into a feud with Holness, but noted his party’s policies are the result of discussions and debates in the community. “We feel they are going to resonate with all Quebecers, French, English-speaking, newcomers and Indigenous. We have our plan. We’re confident. This is not a fly-by-night idea for us. It is intellectually and morally and legally sound principles.” He challenged Legault’s views that French is in decline, noting 80 per cent of Quebecers are mother-tongue-French. “The decline of French in Quebec is a myth,” Standish said. Standish said the Canadian Party of Quebec will be officially launched some time in mid-May. pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/philipauthier More On This Topic Voters will have another option this fall: the Canadian Party of Quebec Montreal needs voice in National Assembly, Holness says in previewing new party\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nMontreal Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

The answers from Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino didn’t offer much hope for those looking for answers. “Will the Liberals disclose their internal analysis that showed they met the threshold for the Emergencies Act and the justice department’s private opinion, or are they just going to keep hiding this information from Canadians?” Edmonton-area MP Dane Lloyd asked.

Try refreshing your browser, or One of the criticisms of the order establishing the inquiry, though, is that it allows the government to refuse publicly release documents or information based on national security concerns. The order also instructs the inquiry to look into the conduct of the protesters, but not the government. Mendicino responded to that claim by saying that “the judge can look into the conduct of police enforcement.” The conduct of police is a far cry from looking into the actions or the failures of federal, provincial and municipal politicians. That is not something the government has encouraged with their calling of the inquiry.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Conservative MP @MichaelChongMP asked the Trudeau government to give the inquiry into the use of the Emergencies Act all the information they need and not hide behind cabinet confidences.

In order to do that, Justice Rouleau needs access to documents covered by cabinet confidence,” Chong said. “Will the Prime Minister, will the government, waive cabinet confidence?” Mendicino, a former Crown prosecutor, reminded the Commons that people were arrested as a result of these protests. What he didn’t say was that no one has faced charges that required the Emergencies Act. He also spoke of working “in co-operation with the judge” leading the inquiry without saying that the government would grant full access to documents. Last week, the Trudeau government cited cabinet confidence in refusing to release documents in defence of a lawsuit over the use of the Emergencies Act.\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nYour Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

Try refreshing your browser, or CN says search for francophone, Quebec-based director has begun Back to video Canadian National Railway said Tuesday it’s begun a search for a francophone Quebec-based board member after sparking controversy for failing to nominate a single French-speaking director. The new board member will be appointed “in the coming months” following a “rigorous process,” Canada’s largest railroad said Tuesday in a statement. This will be in addition to CN’s new Canadian-born chief executive, Tracy Robinson, a three-decade industry veteran who recently relocated to Montreal after being hired in late January. As a former crown corporation until its privatization in 1995, Montreal-based CN is subject to Canada’s Official Languages Act — though the legislation doesn’t govern the company’s board.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content “CN, headquartered in Montreal for over 100 years, and its Board of Directors, is very proud of and respects the company’s rich history in Quebec, where the official language is French,” chairman Robert Pace said in the statement. CN’s board slate for 2022, disclosed in a regulatory filing last week, includes several former railroad executives, none of whom are based in Quebec. The move drew scorn from the $420-billion Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, a major CN shareholder, which criticized the company for ignoring qualified francophone candidates based in its home province. Language skills of CEOs at major Quebec-based companies have become a sensitive issue after Air Canada boss — and native English speaker — Michael Rousseau told reporters in November it was a “testament to Montreal” that he could live here without speaking French. Rousseau had earlier delivered an English-only speech to the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Canada’s biggest railroad had planned to have at least one francophone director in 2022, but political events decided otherwise. CN appointed Jean Charest as independent director in January, only for the former Quebec premier to resign April 1 when he decided to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. Board makeup is quickly turning into a political issue. Companies that are subject to the Official Languages Act, such as CN and Air Canada, should be forced by Ottawa to have a minimum proportion of francophone directors, Conservative Party official languages critic Joël Godin said Tuesday. “We must have a tool to force federally chartered companies to have francophones,” said Godin, who is vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages,.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The Conservatives are preparing an amendment to the bill that aims to modernize the Official Languages Act, Godin also said. Lawmakers are currently debating the minimum proportion of francophones and the mechanism to impose this requirement. Godin’s position is consistent with that of the chair of the official languages committee, Liberal MP René Arseneault. Businesses subject to the Official Languages Act, “no matter how independent,” should represent “the linguistic demographics of the country,” said Arseneault, who represents the Madawaska-Restigouche riding. This would mean making it mandatory that “at the very least” a quarter of board of members be francophone. Issues surrounding the use of French at CN go beyond the boardroom.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Officials at the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference wrote to Robinson earlier this month to highlight “multiple problems regarding the use and quality of the French language in the workplace,” La Presse reported last week. Employees who say they’re uncomfortable working in in English “are subject to pressure, threats of disciplinary action and a treatment that could sometimes amount to retaliation,” the union said in its letter. Separately, CN said Tuesday that adjusted diluted profit rose seven per cent in the first quarter to $1.32 a share. Quarterly revenue advanced five per cent to $3.71 billion. Citing “challenging” operating conditions and “worldwide economic uncertainty,” CN also cut its full-year financial outlook. Adjusted diluted profit for 2022 is now expected to rise by 15 per cent to 20 per cent, the company said, down from an earlier target of 20 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Robinson addressed the language situation on a late-afternoon call with financial analysts, her first since taking over — and even spent a couple of minutes reading a statement in heavily accented French. The new CEO said she’s been practicing her French since moving to Montreal two months ago. “It’s a priority for me and for CN,” Robinson said in French. “I want to make sure that anyone can communicate with CN in the official language of their choice. It’s also important for us to have francophone directors.” Robinson concluded her prepared remarks by thanking her predecessor, Quebecer Jean-Jacques Ruest, for his 25 years of service at CN and his “exemplary leadership.” “Merci beaucoup JJ,” she said.

Try refreshing your browser, or LILLEY: Will Ontario's NDP and Liberals form a coalition, too? Back to video The leaders of both parties have expressed an interest in working together if Ford wins the most seats, but not a majority, and the Liberals are actively pursuing the NDP as they try to scratch their way back to power from third place. On Monday, NDP leader Andrea Horwath unveiled her party’s platform. It’s filled with promises to hire 30,000 nurses, 20,000 teachers and education workers, 10,000 personal support workers, and planks that will have the government spending until the cows come home on every project imaginable – except highways, roads, and other vital infrastructure. In days past, Liberals of the centrist variety — the people who didn’t want to go too far left or too far right — would’ve looked at the NDP platform in horror. The reckless spending, the promises to tax successful people and businesses into oblivion — or prompt them to leave the province –would have made them think twice about offering any praise.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Not current Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca, who issued a statement effectively, saying his Liberals are just like the NDP. “I see a lot of the ideas Ontario Liberals have already announced as part of our Liberal plan. I can tell you there are also some proposals that we had already decided to include in our platform but not yet released,” Del Duca said, while adding there is a lot in the NDP plan he could work with.

Try refreshing your browser, or If Del Duca isn’t courting NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, he’s definitely courting her voters. Like Kathleen Wynne before him, Del Duca has decided that the path to power lies in being more like the NDP and abandoning the middle ground where the majority of the electorate sits.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content It’s a strange plan for him to follow. Between the 2014 and 2018 elections, the Ontario Liberals lost roughly 740,000 votes. The PC Party picked up 821,000 and the NDP increased by 784,000 votes. Obviously, far more people came out to vote in 2018 when the province saw a 58% voter participation rate compared to just 51% in 2014, but more people also went to Ford’s PCs than Horwath’s NDP. Why not target them? “You don’t understand,” said one top Liberal recently. “We need to own the progressive side and don’t really care what is happening with Tory voters.” That much is evident from their campaign promises. Del Duca isn’t attempting to reach disaffected Ford voters so much as people who voted for Horwath and the NDP and think she’s done a bad job as Opposition leader.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Horwath has certainly failed on that front. If she were a competent Opposition leader, Ford wouldn’t be entering the election leading in the polls. Yet, in focusing on Horwath, Del Duca is, in effect, auditioning for the job of leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition while leaving Ford a lot of room to manoeuvre. He says he’s focused on Doug Ford and replacing him as premier, but Del Duca is aiming squarely at the NDP. The Liberals are hoping that they can steal enough NDP votes to find a way back to power, but barring that, they’ll look for an NDP-Liberal coalition to seal the deal. “I’m prepared to have conversations,” Del Duca said a month ago regarding coalitions talks. When the polls close June 2, we’ll find out if voters want Del Duca to have those conversations or if they’ll side with the stability of a second Ford term rather than put an NDP-Liberal coalition into place on Parliament Hill and at Queen’s Park.

MacDonald, 43, died later in hospital. He had worked at Providence Health for the previous 25 years and was the manager of maintenance and plant services. Abilaziz Mohamed allegedly put an end to all that. And why did this good man die? He was watching his beloved Toronto Maple Leafs edge the Montreal Canadiens 2-1 and got into a dispute inside the watering hole. According to police, Mohamed apparently decided that such effrontery could not go unpunished, so in a cowardly way, he followed MacDonald to the parking lot, allegedly pulled out his gun, and shot him.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Detectives zeroed in on Mohamed pretty quickly, and now they need your help to put the alleged killer behind bars. And the Bolo Program will pay as much as $250,000 for information that leads to his arrest and conviction. Bolo announced on Tuesday its list of the 25 most wanted criminals in Canada. More than half come from the GTA with our pal Mohamed leading the hit parade. And they’ll pay big bucks if you drop a dime on any of these alleged killers. Most wanted programs have been around since the days when posters were a fixture of post offices and other government buildings. The initiative got a massive boost when the FBI came out with its 10 Most Wanted list on March 14, 1950. The tool proved effective, spilling over the border and resulting in the capture of thousands of killers, conmen, pedophiles and a host of other nefarious villains.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content And they are effective. Too often, cops see the public as a nuisance and a hindrance to their investigations.

MacDonald’s family described him as an “ordinary guy” doing a “very ordinary thing when his life ended. “It could happen to anyone because my brother was just a regular guy, and I’m telling you, everyone loved him,” his sister, Drema, told Global News last year.

Carry on. For now, at least.\n\nWhen the White House announced Kamala Harris’ health status on Tuesday, the terse five-sentence statement from her press secretary, Kirsten Allen, encapsulated something of the current U.S. coronavirus posture neatly.\n\n“Today, Vice President Harris tested positive for COVID-19 on rapid and PCR tests. She has exhibited no symptoms, will isolate and continue to work from the vice president’s residence,” the statement began. It said she hadn’t recently had close contact with the president due to travel schedules.\n\nThere were immediate news alerts, but the cable news channels didn’t turn to the Veep’s diagnosis for long before returning to Ukraine, Alec Baldwin, and Elon Musk buying Twitter.\n\nThat relative shrug at Harris’ news mirrors the broader approach to the COVID situation, in which the virus continues to circulate in the U.S., clearly even among the vaccinated and boosted. In D.C. within the past six weeks, the list of movers and shakers who’ve contracted the illness after all of this time includes the speaker of the House of Representatives, the mayor of Washington, and the president’s press secretary (for a second time). But mask requirements in most places are all but a memory, freely available at-home antigen tests have largely begun replacing official PCR testing for most suspected cases, and isolation protocols have been greatly relaxed. For weeks, Congress has been delaying passage of renewed funding to fight COVID.\n\n“We are in a complicated moment in the pandemic,” White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha wrote in a CNN oped that urged renewed funding and was circulated by the White House this week. “Infections, while low, are rising again in many parts of the country — driven by a new and more transmissible subvariant of Omicron, known as BA.2,” he wrote. “While deaths are declining, hundreds of Americans are still dying from COVID-19 each day.” He warned against the impulse to “think the pandemic is over.”\n\nYet clearly, authorities are eager not to dwell on it any more, either — it has dropped off as a public topic of daily discussion in the White House, and new or revived restrictions aren’t really up for discussion. Much (but not all) of the public is with them on that.\n\nYou can certainly see a change in tone and sense of alarm from the last time an elected member of the executive branch tested positive — when a death watch convened at the Walter Reed Hospital and media parsed the details of a White House superspreader event where he may have contracted or given it to those around him.\n\nPart of the difference now — in Harris’ case and more generally — is the widespread availability and efficacy of vaccines in preventing hospitalizations and death. And among the unvaccinated, the incidence of some immunity from prior infection is high — according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) , by February of this year, more than 60 per cent of Americans had been infected with coronavirus at least once.\n\nLikely because of the combination of those two factors, U.S. hospitalizations are at their lowest level since the pandemic’s beginning in March 2020, and deaths have continued to drop despite a rise in infections in the northeast part of the country.\n\nSo there has been no rush with the recent Omicron variant to return to prevention precautions. The White House is appealing a court ruling that struck down the mandate on airplanes and public transit — but widespread reporting suggests the appeal has more to do with the precedent set by the decision, and that mandates won’t be reimposed in the case of victory.\n\nThe White House continues to push, at every opportunity, the message that people should get vaccinated and boosted, though it appears that message may be a matter of preaching to a well-rehearsed choir at this point. Since early February, the number of two-dose vaccinated Americans (about two-thirds) has barely budged and the percentage boosted (30 per cent) has risen only a smidge.\n\nAnd while the Biden administration is distributing millions of free at-home antigen tests and high-quality N95 masks to the public (in our neighbourhood, households can pick up boxes of both at the local library each day), much of its emphasis is moving from individual efforts at prevention to mass detection through wastewater monitoring and, especially, to treatment.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Biden administration announced it was increasing the supply of the antiviral drug Paxlovid available free to the public (which, in a briefing call, a senior administration official said reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 90 per cent) and is ramping up a “test to treat” program in which high-risk people can get a test and, if necessary, a doctor visit and antiviral pill all in one visit, for free.\n\nLess worry about containing the virus, it appears, and more focus on containing the damage it causes.\n\nThe final sentences of the announcement of Harris’ diagnosis reflected a sense this would soon pass. “She will follow CDC guidelines and the advice of her physicians. The vice president will return to the White House when she tests negative.”\n\nAnd what about the 79-year-old president? At the White House press briefing Tuesday, Dr. Jha said that while Harris had no recent contact with Biden, “I wouldn’t say it’s just a matter of time, but of course it is possible that the president, like any other American, could get COVID. The bottom line is he is vaccinated and boosted, he is very well protected, he’s got very good protocols around him to protect him from getting infected. But there is no 100 per cent anything.”\n\nCarry on, then. For now, at least.\n\nSHARE:', 'image': 'https://images.thestar.com/6VxvUonBGgwHtilPmx4Ed4IQhoA=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(1651010145873)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2022/04/26/america-doesnt-much-care-about-covid-19-anymore-just-ask-kamala-harris/kamala.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:25'}

Take five, Dave, take five.\n\nI have tons of emails and stories to look over every morning. I have the time to do this because I’m semi-retired.\n\nIt’s part of my job now, as a columnist with several websites, including the Western Standard.\n\nIt’s a great privilege and I enjoy it.\n\nBut this one really took the cake.\n\nIt was a story that ran in The Defense Post, as follows:\n\nThe Canadian military is acquiring three spy planes under a US foreign military sales agreement to boost its aerial surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\n\nWith a combined price tag of $247 million, Canada’s new 350ER King Air spy planes will be fitted with cutting-edge surveillance gear such as MX-15D targeting equipment.\n\nThe gear features a powerful camera similar to those used in Ukraine to follow Russian troop movements and target airstrikes.\n\nOnce in service, the 350ER King Air aircraft will be used by the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command for missions “at home and abroad.”\n\nOK, that was the news, but check out this follow-up statement …\n\nFor retired Canadian lieutenant-colonel Steve Day, the spy plane can not only be used in international military missions but also to address domestic terrorist threats.\n\nHe described the 350ER King Air aircraft as a “very sophisticated platform” due to its state-of-the-art sensors and warning systems.\n\n350ER King Air aircraft\n\nFolks … let’s have a closer look at this.\n\nLet’s analyze it and see what this really means for you and me. These are your tax dollars and you deserve to know what is going on here.\n\nIt’s clear these aircraft are state of the art. No question about that.\n\nAccording to The Defense Post, developed by Textron Aviation’s Beechcraft, the 350ER King Air has reportedly become a “popular basis” for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance.\n\nIt can fly up to 2,311 nautical miles (4,279 kilometers/2,659 miles) and carry up to 10 personnel, including two crew, the report said. Its maximum speed is 303 knots (561 km/h-348 mph).\n\nOfficially, the sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by helping to improve the military capability of Canada.\n\nThat is a cool toy, right? A very cool toy.\n\nWill it be used by CSIS, Counter Narcotics (RCMP) or the military? They say Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, but what the hell does that mean?\n\nFurther, who in God’s name will it be used against?\n\nIf it was to be used internationally — against the Islamic State in northern Iraq or in Syria — the aircraft would have to be ferried to its location. Does that sound practical to you?\n\nInstead, why wouldn’t we buy ARTEMIS (the Airborne Reconnaissance and Target Exploitation Multi-Mission System) in the Bombardier Challenger 650, currently being used by the US Army over Eastern Europe?\n\nNo, these King Airs aren’t going anywhere, so to speak. They will be used in Canada. And it doesn’t take a college grad to figure that out.\n\nWe know they won’t be used in the Arctic against the Russians.\n\nCanada is looking at buying P-8A Poseidon long-range maritime aircraft from Boeing to replace its aging fleet of CP-140 Auroras, as part of the never-ending Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project.\n\nA replacement program that should have happened years ago.\n\nNo … my fear, my great fear, is they will be used against us. That’s right, us.\n\nThose evil “Nazi” truckers and Bouncy Castle revolutionaries — people who have different ideas that they don’t like, people they fear.\n\nThe Fred and Marthas who donated to the Freedom Convoy, who were vilified by a cowardly prime minister who ran and hid.\n\nPeople like me, who write the truth. People who don’t shovel their driveways or people who like Sean Penn. Take your pick.\n\nGod forbid they use it against eco-terrorists in northern BC. No, that would make sense.\n\nAccording to my intel sources, because we have so very few internal threats (other than Iraqi and Russian embassy staff under 24/7 surveillance), they will have to pull old security files.\n\nKeep in mind that one in four Canadians has an RCMP file.\n\nYou thought you had freedom? Say goodnight, Virginia. The new era has arrived, and “we” are the enemy.\n\nClearly, they will have to dig deep, very deep to find new threats — even if they have to invent them to keep those shiny twin-engine beauties flying.\n\nYour basic, “Round up the usual suspects,” so they can justify this expense.\n\nJust imagine, folks, everything you ever texted on your cellphone or said on social media, every inch of metadata, is being tracked and monitored by the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canada’s other spy agency.\n\nI’m sorry, but this spy plane deal is a joke. This is a waste of money.\n\nWhy?\n\nSimple. Ask any eight-year old, who asks his mom and dad to buy them a Chinese-made DJI drone at Amazon.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that drones are far cheaper, more effective and easier to deploy anywhere in the world.\n\nInterestingly, they could be fully operated and controlled from Spec Ops Command in Petawawa, Ont.\n\nAs we speak, drones are re-writing the rules of war over Ukraine and kicking Russian ass. They are a proven commodity.\n\nThe other thing the RCMP Air Service has employed is spy planes over Canadian cities for decades, one of which was LCT (Lima Charlie Tango).\n\nFor entertainment, I used to tune in on my Sony air radio to hear them talk with Air Traffic Control — it was laughable. Literally anyone, any bad guy in southern Alberta, could hear everything they said.\n\nCities like Calgary also have the HAWCS helicopter for surveillance and watch-list harassment.\n\nSo why in God’s name are we buying these things? Why are we buying a howitzer to kill a mosquito?\n\nIs it because allies like Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and the US have them and we have to keep up with the neighbourhood?\n\nThat’s probably a big part of it, I would think — the potential for near-real-time data transfer and interoperability with allies. \u202a\n\nBe there or be square, as they say.\n\nThe other part: I think it’s clear there’s a big new intelligence push happening in Canada. It’s a scary world out there and it’s getting scarier.\n\nCall it the Putin factor, the ISIS factor, the Trucker factor … whatever.\n\nBut it’s happening and you, my friends, are going to pay for it with your tax dollars whether you like it or not.\n\nThe cost in freedom is yet to be determined.\n\nDave Makichuk is a Western Standard contributor.\n\nPTacitus27@gmail.com', 'image': 'https://westernstandardonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/maj2-1000x600.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:13:41'}

I have the time to do this because I’m semi-retired.\n\nIt’s part of my job now, as a columnist with several websites, including the Western Standard.\n\nIt’s a great privilege and I enjoy it.\n\nBut this one really took the cake.\n\nIt was a story that ran in The Defense Post, as follows:\n\nThe Canadian military is acquiring three spy planes under a US foreign military sales agreement to boost its aerial surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\n\nWith a combined price tag of $247 million, Canada’s new 350ER King Air spy planes will be fitted with cutting-edge surveillance gear such as MX-15D targeting equipment.\n\nThe gear features a powerful camera similar to those used in Ukraine to follow Russian troop movements and target airstrikes.\n\nOnce in service, the 350ER King Air aircraft will be used by the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command for missions “at home and abroad.”\n\nOK, that was the news, but check out this follow-up statement …\n\nFor retired Canadian lieutenant-colonel Steve Day, the spy plane can not only be used in international military missions but also to address domestic terrorist threats.\n\nHe described the 350ER King Air aircraft as a “very sophisticated platform” due to its state-of-the-art sensors and warning systems.\n\n350ER King Air aircraft\n\nFolks … let’s have a closer look at this.\n\nLet’s analyze it and see what this really means for you and me. These are your tax dollars and you deserve to know what is going on here.\n\nIt’s clear these aircraft are state of the art. No question about that.\n\nAccording to The Defense Post, developed by Textron Aviation’s Beechcraft, the 350ER King Air has reportedly become a “popular basis” for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance.\n\nIt can fly up to 2,311 nautical miles (4,279 kilometers/2,659 miles) and carry up to 10 personnel, including two crew, the report said. Its maximum speed is 303 knots (561 km/h-348 mph).\n\nOfficially, the sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by helping to improve the military capability of Canada.\n\nThat is a cool toy, right? A very cool toy.\n\nWill it be used by CSIS, Counter Narcotics (RCMP) or the military? They say Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, but what the hell does that mean?\n\nFurther, who in God’s name will it be used against?\n\nIf it was to be used internationally — against the Islamic State in northern Iraq or in Syria — the aircraft would have to be ferried to its location. Does that sound practical to you?\n\nInstead, why wouldn’t we buy ARTEMIS (the Airborne Reconnaissance and Target Exploitation Multi-Mission System) in the Bombardier Challenger 650, currently being used by the US Army over Eastern Europe?\n\nNo, these King Airs aren’t going anywhere, so to speak. They will be used in Canada. And it doesn’t take a college grad to figure that out.\n\nWe know they won’t be used in the Arctic against the Russians.\n\nCanada is looking at buying P-8A Poseidon long-range maritime aircraft from Boeing to replace its aging fleet of CP-140 Auroras, as part of the never-ending Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project.\n\nA replacement program that should have happened years ago.\n\nNo … my fear, my great fear, is they will be used against us. That’s right, us.\n\nThose evil “Nazi” truckers and Bouncy Castle revolutionaries — people who have different ideas that they don’t like, people they fear.\n\nThe Fred and Marthas who donated to the Freedom Convoy, who were vilified by a cowardly prime minister who ran and hid.\n\nPeople like me, who write the truth. People who don’t shovel their driveways or people who like Sean Penn. Take your pick.\n\nGod forbid they use it against eco-terrorists in northern BC. No, that would make sense.\n\nAccording to my intel sources, because we have so very few internal threats (other than Iraqi and Russian embassy staff under 24/7 surveillance), they will have to pull old security files.\n\nKeep in mind that one in four Canadians has an RCMP file.\n\nYou thought you had freedom? Say goodnight, Virginia. The new era has arrived, and “we” are the enemy.\n\nClearly, they will have to dig deep, very deep to find new threats — even if they have to invent them to keep those shiny twin-engine beauties flying.\n\nYour basic, “Round up the usual suspects,” so they can justify this expense.\n\nJust imagine, folks, everything you ever texted on your cellphone or said on social media, every inch of metadata, is being tracked and monitored by the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canada’s other spy agency.\n\nI’m sorry, but this spy plane deal is a joke. This is a waste of money.\n\nWhy?\n\nSimple. Ask any eight-year old, who asks his mom and dad to buy them a Chinese-made DJI drone at Amazon.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that drones are far cheaper, more effective and easier to deploy anywhere in the world.\n\nInterestingly, they could be fully operated and controlled from Spec Ops Command in Petawawa, Ont.\n\nAs we speak, drones are re-writing the rules of war over Ukraine and kicking Russian ass. They are a proven commodity.\n\nThe other thing the RCMP Air Service has employed its spy planes over Canadian cities for decades, one of which was LCT (Lima Charlie Tango).\n\nFor entertainment, I used to tune in on my Sony air radio to hear them talk with Air Traffic Control — it was laughable. Literally anyone, any bad guy in southern Alberta, could hear everything they said.\n\nCities like Calgary also have the HAWCS helicopter for surveillance and watch-list harassment.\n\nSo why in God’s name are we buying these things? Why are we buying a howitzer to kill a mosquito?\n\nIs it because allies like Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and the US have them and we have to keep up with the neighbourhood?\n\nThat’s probably a big part of it, I would think — the potential for near-real-time data transfer and interoperability with allies. \u202a\n\nBe there or be square, as they say.\n\nThe other part: I think it’s clear there’s a big new intelligence push happening in Canada. It’s a scary world out there and it’s getting scarier.\n\nCall it the Putin factor, the ISIS factor, the Trucker factor … whatever.\n\nBut it’s happening and you, my friends, are going to pay for it with your tax dollars whether you like it or not.\n\nThe cost in freedom is yet to be determined.\n\nDave Makichuk is a Western Standard contributor.\n\nPTacitus27@gmail.com', 'image': 'https://westernstandardonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dress-1000x600.webp', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:04'}

In Canada, vaccine-free Canadians still cannot board a train or a plane and travel from one region of the country to another.\n\nIn Canada, air and train travel are regulated by the federal government, even when you travel within the same province. The feds have made it so only a vaccine passport, or very limited jab exemptions, will afford you the opportunity to visit family, friends, or travel for work.\n\nThis means that if you lived in, let’s say, Kitchener, Ontario, you could not get on a VIA Rail train and travel to Toronto… even though you could travel from Kitchener to Toronto on a commuter train that is not under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIsn’t “science” wonderful!\n\nOh, and vaccine-free Canadians also can’t LEAVE the country. Unjabbed Canadians are told they can’t “put others at risk” by boarding a plane with vaccinated people (because vaccines suddenly…work?). Apparently, it is good for the unvaccinated to stay in Canada, even though … they are risk to everyone else who is protected by a vaccine?\n\nTrudeau’s insecurity on display\n\nNow, on the one hand it is quite easy to understand why Trudeau is acting like an evil dictator: he has proven himself to be an immoral tyrant on many occasions. However, given the fact that other leftist tyrants have eased up, it is clearly not just leftism or progressivism that causing him to trap Canadians indefinitely in their home like real-life versions of The Truman Show. (How fitting that it was Canadian Jim Carrey who starred in that film.)\n\nThere is something unique about Trudeau that is causing him to become “regressive” as the rest of the leftist dominated West is affording vaccine-free citizens their civil rights.\n\nTo the outside world, Trudeau may look like a confident – if not cringeworthy – tin-pot dictator, but in reality, he is a 50-year-old boy with little to no virtue. He is essentially a spoiled teenager who can remember lines and present himself well in a tailored suit and has a family name that tricked people into thinking he was competent.\n\nHis (Canadian) father Pierre Trudeau, for all his faults, was shrewd and intelligent – even if evil. Justin Trudeau is evil and unintelligent and quite obtuse.\n\nI can’t help but think he believes he must prove himself as being his own verified dictator in order to fill his daddy’s shoes.

Sign this Petition Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reinstate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. After contentious negotiations, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, thereby transforming the tech giant into a private company. A self-styled "free speech absolutist," Mr. Musk\'s entrepreneurial spirit may define his approach to governing Twitter, where, in the marketplace of ideas, the best ideas - not those aided by censorship - will naturally prevail among the competition. Of course, there are limits to free speech. But, for too long, Big Tech giants (including, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook) have subjected their conservative and Christian users to all forms of censorship, desperately trying to silence our voices. So if, as it seems, Mr. Musk will level the playing field for conservatives and Christians and allow a true exchange of ideas to occur on his platform, then we look forward to our chance to re-engage on Twitter. Please SIGN and SHARE this petition to the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, asking him to reactivate LifeSiteNews\' truth-telling Twitter accounts which have been suspended since early 2021. They are: https://twitter.com/LifeSite\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LSNCatholic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCDM_LSN\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCEA_LSN These accounts have been blocked by the outgoing Twitter regime for more than a year for calling a ‘transgender woman’ (Assistant Secretary of Health, \'Rachel\' Levine), a man, and for tweeting an article about the same person. The article we tweeted makes mention of the troubling paradox of having a person who denies the basic science of the human anatomy be in an authoritative position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but does not cast aspersions or any other such “hate speech” against Levine, according to Twitter’s "rules." It is our fervant hope that Mr. Musk intends to allow - rather than censor - our descriptions of reality as we know them to be true in regards to human sexuality, as well as in other areas of life. Mr. Musk evidently understands how significant freedom of speech is to the functioning of a free society as he was quoted as saying that this deal is important for "the future of civlization." LifeSiteNews believes that being able to spread the truth in charity is absolutely vital for the future of society, as the "truth shall make you free." (Jn 8:32) And so, in order for us to charitably spread the truth far and wide, we now seek to re-engage on Twitter\'s public square.

The New Democrats have cozied up to Trudeau in order to pretend they are a sane and legitimate party and have promised to prop up his regime. Promises don’t really mean anything when politicians make them, so we shouldn’t assume that the communists will be loyal to each other.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that public opinion is against Trudeau to a degree that he will not be able to withstand.\n\nThere is a reason why Trudeau had to resort to the Emergencies Act to squash the Freedom Convoy; no one wanted to stop it until they were forced to by law.\n\nThe various levels of provincial and municipal governance could have stopped the movement the way they stop any non-violent protest – but they didn’t want to.\n\nDoes this mean that the cops and all the citizens supported the convoy? Of course not, but I think that enough of them saw how absurd things have become and just wanted something to make the whole charade of 2020-2021-2022 go away.\n\nThe application of the Emergencies Act was wildly unpopular amongst Canadians, both on the Left and the Right. Leftists were happy to see the movement end, but were unimpressed that Trudeau ended it in such an absurd way. Conservatives generally supported the movement, and therefore saw Trudeau as a complete lunatic for doing what he did.\n\nAll of this means that in the long run Trudeau is hurting his reputation, even amongst his base. This is not news for him as the Conservative leadership race heats up.\n\nFreedom is on the move\n\nWithout giving the impression that I think Canada is on the brink of some massive societal restoration, I would be remiss if I did not speak to the positives.\n\nPresently we are witnessing the first real Conservative leadership race in a long time. Pierre Pollievre is filling arenas and convention centres with freedom loving crowds, and Leslyn Lewis is making leftist journalists look silly on national TV. It is worth remember that we are talking about a leadership race, not an election, but the swell of right-wing uprising is palpable.\n\nIn fact, the last time something like this happened was after a groundswell of Christian/right-wing sentiment after years of leftist oppression under the former Trudeau and his successors.\n\nAs a result of that, we had Stephen Harper for a decade who, although not perfect, was a saint compared to Trudeau.\n\nThe economy is tanking in Canada, and goods and services are becoming prohibitively expensive for average people. Trudeau and his cronies can appeal to idealism and progressivism all they want, but even left-wingers get ticked off and want change when they are struggling to fill the tank.\n\nUltimately, Trudeau is continuing to trap vaccine-free Canadians from participating fully in society because he knows that if he pulls the plug on his last failing restriction, that his regime will go down the drain.\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://www.lifesitenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1354093065.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:13:37'}

By September 2021 the insurance market grew around 5.3 per cent, according to the figures of the CNSF, with a raising of direct premium to 494 billion Mexican pesos, a figure that exceeds the one for 2019.\n\nHowever, the loss ratio increased by 11.9 per cent by the end of September 2021, with an increase of 14.2 per cent in life insurance and of 20.4 per cent in health insurance; the highest increase since the implementation of Solvency II.\n\nThe life and health insurance markets have grown as a result of the pandemic, despite an increase in the cost of premiums partly because of the inflation in private healthcare services. Despite the growth of life and health insurance, the proportion of the Mexican population insured is still very small; according to AMIS' figures, only around 15 per cent of Mexicans in a formal job have a life insurance.\n\nOn the other hand, the drop in travel insurance and coverage for tourist destinations such as Quintana Roo was noticeable early in the year as a result of the pandemic. Automobile insurance was one of the lines of business most affected by the pandemic with a decrease in premium of 2.4 per cent by the end of September 2021 mainly because of the substantial contraction in car sales.\n\nAccording to the CNSF, as of February 2021, the Mexican insurance sector comprises 101 insurance companies licensed to operate in Mexico (of which 56 are subsidiaries of foreign insurance companies) and 241 foreign reinsurance companies registered with the Reinsurance Registry, including Lloyd's of London. Nine atomic pools (nuclear insurance pools) were also registered with the Reinsurance Registry to take reinsurance in Mexico. Direct premiums in the insurance and surety sectors decreased had by 4.6 per cent by the end of September 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Of the total amount of premiums by the end of September 2020, 97.7 per cent came from direct insurance and only 2.3 per cent came from reinsurance.\n\nThe penetration of insurance with respect to Mexico's gross domestic product is 2.3 per cent. In 2020, AMIS and the CNSF announced that they will work together on a strategy to increase penetration to 2.8 per cent by 2022, but no further information has been released on the progress of this strategy.\n\nIn the context of the 30th annual convention of AMIS, the CNSF, the SHCP and AMIS entered into a memorandum of understanding with the purpose of promoting gender equality, diversity and inclusion in the insurance sector.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive time, Mapfre won the public tender to placement of the two-year property and casualty (P&C) policy for Pemex, which represents a total premium of US$563 million.\n\nii Lloyd's\n\nProbitas 1492 (syndicate 1492), Newline Group (syndicate 1218) and Liberty Mutual Re (syndicate 4472) Specialty Services are the only three Lloyd's syndicates with physical presence in Mexico. The lack of appetite of Lloyd's for Latin-American risk continues shifting to other regions and products and in its strategy. It is still unclear how this will affect the business flow and capacity that was traditionally provided to the Mexican market by Lloyd's.\n\nTwo Mexican groups, Grupo Nacional Provincial and Reaseguradora Patria currently have investments in Lloyd's.\n\niii Regulators\n\nThe CNSF has made progress adjusting to the administration of President López Obrador and, albeit during a pandemic, it is now operating more efficiently. Moreover, the technological tools and procedures that were implemented as a result of the pandemic are now fully in place and the market has become accustomed to them.\n\nRicardo Ernesto Ochoa Rodríguez continues to serve as president of the CNSF.\n\nThe temporary scheme established on 3 August 2020 by the CNSF regarding the procedure for the calculation of terms based on the level of contingency of the covid-19 pandemic (determined by the federal government) is still in place.\n\nCarlos Noriega, who served as head of the Insurance, Pensions and Social Security Unit in the Ministry of Finance since March 2020, resigned from the position on 1 January 2021, being replaced by José Alfredo Tijerina and subsequently by Héctor Santana Suárez, who currently holds the position.\n\nOutlook and conclusions\n\ni Regulatory\n\nThe CNSF and the SHCP have been clear on their concern about the low penetration of insurance and their commitment to take action for a more inclusive market; however, no relevant actions have been implemented to this end.\n\nWith regard to catastrophic risk, the General Law for Comprehensive Disaster Risk Management and Civil Protection, expected to be approved in 2021, has not yet been approved by the Senate. Currently, the federal government has a catastrophic insurance for up to 5 billion Mexican pesos with a franchise of 275 million Mexican pesos. It also has a CAT-Bond for US$485 million for earthquakes and hurricanes valid until March 2024. However, these instruments are not sufficient to cover the funds of the natural disaster fund FONDEN. After the cancellation of the natural disaster fund FONDEN back in September 2020, the lack of sufficient resources and a reliable mechanism to cover catastrophic risks should be a matter of concern.\n\nThere has been an increase in demand for political risk coverage, given the growing perception of the potential for damage to investors and companies as a result of political decisions by the current government, mainly in the infrastructure and the energy sectors.\n\nWhile the regulators are aware of insurtech's potential to provide access to the benefits of insurance products for vulnerable groups, the present regulatory regime has unfortunately become a hurdle rather than an incentive for the development of products and projects in this area. Coping with compliance and regulatory challenges, including a strict anti-money laundering (AML) regime, data protection and privacy regulations, makes it difficult for start-ups to flourish in this highly regulated industry. Notwithstanding this, new risks continue to require innovative products, presenting new challenges to the regulators. Although the country's industry is solid and well-capitalised, it nonetheless continues to disappoint in terms of penetration, inclusion and innovation.\n\nWe have seen a growth in funds' appetite for working with insurance companies and benefiting from them as institutional investors. The insurance industry has not fully embraced its potential as a key institutional investor, with the exception of a few insurance companies actively investing in private equity, venture capital and other securities, such as development trusts and real estate trusts. There is interest in seeing regulators enhance and provide incentives to insurance companies and we still expect to see changes in insurance companies' investment programmes, in line with the current government's interest in financing long-term infrastructure projects.\n\nii Case law\n\nWe continue to see a growth in insurance and reinsurance-related disputes and related litigation, resulting in the development of court precedents on insurance and reinsurance related matters. The courts are very active in developing the concept of moral damages (similar to that of punitive damages); the concept now forms part of most claims, with important consequences for the insurance industry.\n\nThe contra proferentem principle in insurance continues to be applied, affecting insurance claims that are being argued before the courts.\n\nThe Mexican Supreme Court (SCJN) ruled in favour of the possibility to claim on constitutional grounds through an amparo lawsuit if an insurance company refuses to give coverage on medical expenses to people with Down's syndrome or other disabilities based on that disability. This was a relevant precedent to protect human rights.\n\nOn 17 February 2021, the First Chamber of the SCJN issued a judicial precedent pursuant to which it determined that if a premium is not paid within the grace period of 30 days from the perfection of the contract or as agreed by the parties, the insurance contract terminates automatically, even if the insurer received the premium.\n\nThe rationale of SCJN is based on the assumption that the insurance contract is bilateral, onerous and aleatory, and is perfected at the moment in which the contracting party becomes aware of the acceptance of the offer made by the insurer. Additionally, according to the LCS, from the due date for payment of the premium, the contracting party has a grace period of 30 calendar days to pay the premium. If the contracting party pays the premium after said term and the insurer accepts the late payment, the effects of the insurance contract may not be rehabilitated. According to the criteria of the SCJN, once the insurance contract is terminated, there must be a new offer from the insured and the same shall be agreed with the insurer to formalise a new insurance contract.\n\nMoreover, the SCJN issued a second precedent stating that pursuant to Article 41 of the Law the insurance contract is invalidated when payment of the insurance premium is made outside the grace period of 30 calendar days, even when the insurer does not immediately refuse such payment. In this case, the rationale of the First Chamber of the SCJN, consistent with the judicial precedent described above, is based on the premise that the first paragraph of Article 40 of the Law establishes that if the contracting party does not pay the premium or the corresponding instalment (in the case where it is paid in instalments) within the grace period of 30 calendar days, the effects of the insurance contract will cease automatically at 12 o´clock on the last day of such term.\n\niii Reinsurance claims\n\nAs previously identified, one of the main sources of disputes in reinsurance stems from fronting arrangements widely used in Mexico in the context of a legal framework where the insurance company maintains its liability to the insured despite the fact that, technically, it is simply fronting the risk. This particular state of affairs – where reinsurers' lack of understanding of Mexican law and the lack of diligence in policy underwriting to ensure wording considers the effects of Mexican law with regard to English wording of reinsurance placements used in fronting arrangements – has consistently raised discrepancies between insurance and reinsurance policies and Mexican law, and is the origin of a number of disputes between the London and Mexican markets.\n\nThese inconsistencies are further exacerbated by abusive practices in the handling of claims by the reinsurance market, prejudicing the insurance companies that placed the business through fronting arrangements.\n\nWe have seen some interesting developments in the Mexican AML regime aligned with international standards and these may contribute to harmonising local placements with limitations of liability under international reinsurance programmes.\n\nThere is opportunity in Mexico to use effectively and promote alternative dispute resolution mechanisms specialised in insurance and reinsurance claims, including mediation and arbitration and the use of ARIAS Mexico. The inclusion of arbitration clauses in insurance and reinsurance agreements provides for the resolution of conflicts arising in reinsurance contracts through arbitration and also serves to prevent certain situations arising in global insurance programmes. However, the reinsurance market is still generally reluctant to include mediation and arbitration clauses in reinsurance policies.\n\nIn November 2019, the Principles of Reinsurance Contract Law (PRICL) were published by the Project Group (a joint venture set up by several universities and professors, primary insurance company representatives, reinsurance companies and reinsurance brokers and special advisers) in cooperation with the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (known as UNIDROIT). The PRICL set specific reinsurance rules applicable to contract law, with a view to providing help in areas where reinsurance practitioners felt the need to improve legal certainty. The PRICL have been drafted as soft law, which means they will work as optional guidelines on reinsurance contract law when chosen by the parties, and for these principles to have binding effect, the contracting parties should choose to adopt them voluntarily. However, there is also the possibility that the PRICL may be applied by courts or arbitral tribunals, as the case may be, even in cases where the parties have not chosen to apply them.\n\nThe covid-19 pandemic has also raised conflicting views regarding life reinsurance coverage, with arbitration proceedings under way to resolve disputes between Mexican cedents and foreign reinsurers in relation to coverage during the pandemic.\n\nDisputes between cedents and reinsurers regarding reinsurance coverage of losses caused by the pandemic are still continuing, mainly concerning life insurance. Most of such cases are subject to arbitration, therefore the awards will be confidential.\n\niv Distribution\n\nThere have been no changes and the distribution channels in Mexico continue to be strictly regulated and extremely limited, resulting in a lack of penetration of insurance within small and medium-sized companies, which contributed around 52 per cent of the national gross domestic product during 2019.\n\nBancassurance is one of the most important areas of growth within the industry. With very few exceptions, most banking groups operating in Mexico have transferred their insurance business and operations to insurance groups and entered into exclusive distribution arrangements.\n\nAlthough there has been an increase in distribution through online platforms, the traditional distribution through brokers covers 59 per cent of the premiums.\n\nv Consolidation\n\nWe have seen an active insurance market with various M&A transactions and joint ventures. We expect to see further consolidation or growth, or a combination of these, among the current market participants in Mexico in both insurance companies and intermediaries. In particular, we expect health insurance to be a key driver of growth in the insurance industry in the years to come.\n\nWe have also seen a number of joint ventures between the main insurers and insurtech start-ups and technology companies for boosting their capability to provide new digital client-focused products.\n\nvi Product development\n\nThe interest in parametric insurance products for catastrophic risks keeps growing, and there is extensive activity regarding developing and placing parametric insurance products in the insurance and reinsurance market in Mexico. We also expect to see an increase in the distribution of parametric insurance products for individuals.\n\nThe healthcare insurance business has been one of the main areas to see a growth trend in the past year, with new participants entering the market and the introduction of innovative products. The fact that Mexico has a vast population without medical insurance and which is unable or unwilling to purchase traditional healthcare insurance means the country is an attractive prospect for investors and for launching new products. New products in the area of telemedicine and those with a preventive approach have been successfully placed in the market, and we see continuing interest from various participants in growing their stake in the healthcare insurance business.\n\nCyber insurance continues growing as the risk of hacking and the concern of companies for data protection increases.\n\nSince January 2019 all vehicles circulating in federal roads and motorways must have a liability insurance; however, the federal government has not been able to enforce compulsory motor insurance. According to the financial products ombudsman CONDUSEF, seven out of 10 drivers are not insured.\n\nThere has been an increase in the premiums for providing professional liability coverage that does not reflect conditions in the Mexican market. This adjustment is, in fact, a result of international market conditions and it is evident from this that there is a lack of good underwriting practices for products of this kind being placed in Mexico.\n\nIn 2021, Mexico was the second largest target for fintech investments in Latin America as insurtech start-ups keep penetrating the market.

The regulatory agenda for 2021 was focused on:\n\ncontinuing to implement the System for Registry of Operations (SRO); setting forth a regulation on cybersecurity; and creating and regulating the Open Insurance System.\n\nSUSEP also implemented several regulations that were submitted for public consultation in 2020.\n\nOn the heels of the successful previous edition, on 26 July 2021, SUSEP released the second edition of the Regulatory Sandbox, with 21 new projects preliminarily approved and undergoing the process for final approval. The programme's intention is to foster innovation and competition to enhance customer experience and increase marked penetration, reducing insurance prices. If all the 21 entities approved in the second sandbox are authorised to operate, there will be an increase of more than 20 per cent in the number of insurers operating in Brazil, considering the results of both sandbox editions.\n\nAlongside that, CNSP Resolution 422/2021 created a new regulation for the authorisation of insurance companies. The new rule created a fast-track process for obtaining definitive licence by companies in SUSEP's Sandbox.\n\nAs previously mentioned, in February SUSEP Circular 621 and CNSP Resolution 407/2021 removed outdated and redundant requirements embedded in previous regulation and began to take shape as a mechanism to modernise, simplify and enhance damages insurance. This gives the parties greater freedom of contract, provided certain good practices guidelines are maintained. The new regulation grants the registration of new products automatically (i.e., products no longer go through a prior analysis of SUSEP). Additionally, CNSP Resolution 407/2021, issued in March, allows insurance companies to forego the registration process completely for underwriting big risks (e.g., policies with a coverage of at least 15 million reais). SUSEP is shifting its regulation perspective to penalising bad behaviour and expects the market to respond to this new flexibility.\n\nSUSEP also simplified and improved liability products (D&O, E&O, ELI, Cyber Insurance and GLI) to repeal obsolete rules about standard clauses.\n\nIn addition, SUSEP Circular 639/2021 has emerged as a comprehensive and clear legal framework towards substantial progress in reforming the regulatory environment of car insurance products.\n\nPerhaps the most radical change made by SUSEP in 2021 was the creation of the Open Insurance System in July, through CNSP Resolution 415. Although we still have a long way to go before the system is completely operational, SUSEP expects that this system will allow for an increase in competition, incentivise the creation of new products and, overall, increase the quality of the services provided to Brazilian consumers.\n\nIn November 2021, CNSP issued Resolution 422/2021, which modernised the authorisation process of insurers, providing more clarity on how entities can comply with capital requirements applicable to the controlling shareholders and creating a fast-track process for converting sandbox licences into full and definitive licences to operate. This resolution brings an important innovation for the capital requirements of the controlling shareholder, allowing for more flexibility to evidence the economic capacity through the supervised entity itself.\n\nAlso in November, the regulatory body established requirements for the accreditation and operation of data aggregators within the scope of the Open Insurance System, focused on accessing and sharing of personal and non-personal insurance-related data that can be used for innovation in products and services, looking at them from a supervisory and commercial angle (see CNSP Resolution 429/2021).\n\nIn the same month, the supervisor updated the regulation on insurance agents (ie, representatives of the insurers). CNSP Resolution 431/2021 approximates the insurance agents to the managing general agent (MGA), increasing the scope of activities that can be performed by such agents. SUSEP expects to cut the red tape in insurance distributor channels to overcome old regulatory barriers to insurance representatives, who now can act in all types of insurance products.\n\nIn addition, CNSP published CNSP Resolution 434/2021 that regulates insurance policyholders. This Resolution has been in force since 2 March 2022.\n\nOutlook and conclusions\n\nConsistently with other initiatives throughout the past year, SUSEP has sought to promote competition through promoting the entry of new market participants and simplification of the requirements for offering insurance products, along with preserving free competition and respect to the consumer.\n\nSUSEP went through a management change in the beginning of 2022 and, depending on the election results of 2022, SUSEP's management is likely to change again.\n\nWith new management, in 2022, SUSEP's perspective is to continue simplifying the regulation of the insurance sector, reducing its complexity and costs. SUSEP also intends to subscribe to international best practices, to stimulate the development of the insurance market and to adopt a less prescriptive, more principled approach.\n\nAt the forefront of SUSEP's priorities is the revision of the standards regarding reinsurance, co-insurance and retrocession operations, as well as operations in foreign currency and contracting insurance policies abroad. The authority also intends to continue to implement the SRO.\n\nLife and survival coverage offered in life insurance and open-ended supplementary private pension funds may also be subject to revision, with the intention to encourage the annuity market and provide the development of products that better meet consumers' needs.", 'image': 'https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:13:52'}

This has prompted shameful politicking to maintain the border closure, including by prominent members of the president’s own party.\n\nEach day that the Biden administration continues unlawful expulsions is another day it is enforcing racist immigration policies.\n\nOn April 25, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from ending Title 42. But even before that happened, there was talk that the repeal would be delayed. Several Democratic senators have signed onto a bill to keep the measure in place.\n\nIn this critical moment, the administration should clearly refine and defend its plans to restore access to asylum and vigorously oppose any legislative efforts to maintain the expulsions.\n\nExpulsions make the border less safe, particularly for those who make repeated dangerous attempts to cross. Each time, migrants and asylum seekers are often increasingly exhausted, dehydrated, and sick. Once expelled, they have been met with cruelty and targeted violence in northern Mexico, remote areas of the jungle in Central America, or their countries of origin. This includes Haiti, where the government has lost control over strategic areas to the hands of dangerous armed gangs, leaving expelled people unprotected.\n\nEach day that the Biden administration continues unlawful expulsions is another day it is enforcing racist immigration policies. In recent weeks, Black, brown and Indigenous asylum seekers have watched white Ukrainians exempted from expulsion, a policy that should apply to all fleeing violence, conflict or persecution.\n\nIn northern Mexico, I recently spoke with a young asylum seeker who pulled down her mask to show a long scar on her face from being slashed in a knife attack in her home country of Honduras. She said she was targeted for being a lesbian and, while traveling to the United States, kidnapped for ransom near the border, beaten, and forced to take off all her clothes as her captors photographed her.\n\nWhen the woman pleaded with U.S. border officials not to send her to either Honduras or Mexico, she said agents laughed at her, and one said, “I don’t care what’s happening to you.” Then, without screening to see if she faced persecution or torture, as is required by law, they expelled her to Honduras, where she faced death threats from gangs. She has since fled again and is hiding out near the border in hopes that the Biden administration will stay true to its word and restore asylum.\n\nThe U.S. government faces an operational challenge to ensure fair, safe and dignified treatment of border crossers. But the administration has already identified and developed some of the tools needed for orderly and humane reception of asylum seekers.\n\nThe border response plans released so far include heavy involvement of the Department of Health and Human Services and Federal Emergency Management Agency and will allow asylum officers to directly adjudicate protection claims.\n\nThe U.S. public supports a well-managed border in which there is an orderly and safe process for those seeking asylum. The Biden administration should be saying more about how it will move toward a more fair and dignified system that protects families, children, adults and vulnerable groups including LGBTQ+ people from harm.\n\nConversely, backtracking on its commitment would align the administration with politicians and groups playing politics with migrants’ lives, entrenching racial discrimination and amplifying the xenophobic fearmongering.\n\nThis column was produced for Progressive Perspectives, which is run by The Progressive magazine and distributed by Tribune News Service.', 'image': 'https://progressive.org/downloads/17403/download/Screen%20Shot%202022-04-26%20at%2010.43.29%20AM.png?cb=e7baa07753b3ba3b8eaf5c64deeebbca&w=1200', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:19'}

The CFA programme aims to accelerate the final phase of financial closure for already advanced low-carbon projects from a wide range of sectors. This “last mile facilitation” speeds up the implementation of NDCs and helps build the ground for more ambition. I hope financial institutions and project developers are inspired by the CFA process to replicate viable solutions at scale. Every effort is needed to rapidly close the emission gap towards the global goal of 1.5 degrees.”\n\nThe projects have started receiving tailored support ahead of a multi-day event that will be held in May 2022. Support that the projects have received so far has included individual needs assessment discussions as well as financial and technical analysis. The event will allow project proponents to further refine their financial structuring through discussions with interested financial institutions. The event will also provide an opportunity for all participants to network and for policymakers and other initiatives in the climate finance space to learn from the landscape mapping findings and recommendations. The CFA projects include:\n\nCarbon Turnaround: An innovative project for the treatment of organic waste using the Black Soldier Fly technology. Organic waste will be recovered and transformed into insect protein and an organic fertilizer with high nutritional value. Based in Lima, it is managed in partnership with Christof Industries and Grupo GEA.\n\nGrupo Alimenta: Lifesoil™ is our regenerative fertilizer, developed to nourish the soil and crops in a balanced way. Replacing mineral fertilizers with Lifesoil™ does not require additional costs and allows the soil to capture 30 tons of CO2/Ha. We aim to build a network of plants and capture three million tons of CO2.\n\nMarinasol: Installation of floating solar panels within the sedimentation ponds of a shrimp farm, generating renewable energy and contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases.\n\nNovum Solar: The project aims to develop, build and operate several hybrid energy generation systems (solar, battery and backup diesel) to supply electricity for isolated communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Currently powered by diesel, the communities will have a reliable supply of energy 24/7 and there will be a reduction of 530,000 tons of CO2.\n\nRainforest Expeditions and ACCA: This ecotourism project will protect primary forest and reduce CO2 emissions. It will raise awareness among the local population and 35,000-40,000 visitors a year of the need for conservation and the realities of climate change by providing employment and education.\n\nViridis Terra Perú SA: This project will create a demonstration and training centre where up to 1,300 people a year will be taught how to restore degraded land, a biotechnology laboratory with the capacity to produce 1.5 million seedlings a year, a solid forest plantation of 1500 hectares, and a natural conservation area of approximately 300 hectares.\n\nFor media enquiries, please contact:\n\nCarmen Noriega Head of Communications at the British Embassy in Lima Carmen.noriega@fcdo.gov.uk\n\nNotes to editors:', 'image': 'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148319/s960_coin-wooden-table-blurred-nature__2_.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:13:52'}

These include key projects in British Columbia and Quebec as well as a partnership with the national Indigenous Clean Energy (ICE) social enterprise.\n\nTo date, the Northern Responsible Energy Approach for Community Heat and Electricity program (Northern REACHE) has invested more than $29 million in 140 projects and capacity-building initiatives across the North.\n\nThrough the Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities (CERRC) program and the Indigenous Off-Diesel Initiative, NRCan is now supporting 115 capacity-building and renewable energy projects in over 130 communities.\n\nSome projects supported through these programs include:\n\nThe Atlin Hydro expansion project in Yukon has received $39.6 million in funding through Northern REACHE, CERRC, CanNor and the Low Carbon Economy Fund.\n\nTarquti Energy, an Inuit-led energy company, received $979,000 to conduct wind resource assessments in Nunavik.\n\nBaker Lake in Nunavut received $172,000 in funding to install a solar energy system on the local recreational centre.\n\nThe Nunatsiavut Government received $1.4 million to advance wind power projects in Nain, Labrador.\n\nThe Indigenous Off-Diesel Initiative supports 14 energy champions and their remote Indigenous communities/regions in developing and implementing ambitious plans to reduce diesel use for heat and power. This initiative is delivered in collaboration with the Indigenous Clean Energy Social Enterprise and the Pembina Institute.\n\nThe Canada Infrastructure Bank\'s financing is an additional tool for Indigenous communities to consider in combination with federal funding, and the federal government may refer projects for coordinated support with the Canada Infrastructure Bank to better meet project and communities\' needs.\n\nAssociated Links\n\nStay connected\n\nJoin the conversation about the North:\n\nTwitter: GovCan_North\n\nFacebook: GovCan - North\n\n@NRCan (http://twitter.com/nrcan)\n\nSOURCE Natural Resources Canada', 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:44'}

Federal Court Judge Elizabeth Heneghan says in a decision issued April 22 that the order made in late 2020 by then-fisheries minister Bernadette Jordan breached the right to procedural fairness owed to the 19 fish farms that were expected to shut down by the end of June. Fish farm operators Mowi Canada West, Cermaq Canada and Grieg Seafood applied for a judicial review of the order that prevented them from restocking their farms, arguing it lacked reasons and didn\'t "show an appreciation of the facts." Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don\'t miss out. Heneghan agreed with the applicants that when a decision maker departs from a recommended course of action, reasons are required. "The decision, in the absence of reasons, cannot be justified. In the absence of reasons, it is not transparent. In the absence of reasons, it is not intelligible."\n\nHeneghan\'s ruling supports the fish farm operators\' request for judicial review, upholds the injunction that permits restocking of Discovery Island fish farms and sets aside the decision of the minister while a ruling on costs will follow. The BC Salmon Farmers Association said it was encouraged by the decision, however it declined an interview request while it is reviewed the ruling more closely. Trans Mountain pipeline insurers dropping like flies "This is a positive development for the coastal Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities in which we operate, and the thousands of family-supporting jobs our sector sustains," the association says in a statement.\n\nThe Fisheries Department and Minister Joyce Murray did not respond to a request for comment. Heneghan\'s decision also says submissions of interveners, including the David Suzuki Foundation and Georgia Strait Alliance, focused on issues including constitutional protection of First Nations’ rights and respect for the precautionary principle but didn\'t address questions such as the lack of procedural fairness. Federal Court tosses B.C. fish farm phaseout for \'procedural unfairness.\' #salmon #bcpoli #cdnpoli Mowi argued last year that it would suffer losses of about $26 million, would have to lay off at least 78 people and cancel local contracts if it was forced to cull 1.18 million salmon smolts instead of transferring them to the Discovery Island farms. Fish farming has been a contentious practice on the B.C. coast, where some have raised concern about potential impacts on wild stocks. The Cohen commission on the decline of Fraser River sockeye in 2012 described the Discovery Islands as a bottleneck along wild salmon migration routes.\n\nHowever, one of the commission\'s key recommendations to eliminate fish farms along that route was contingent on Fisheries and Oceans finding more than a minimal risk to migrating stocks by September 2020. That condition was not met. Instead, by September 2020, nine reports by the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat concluded that fish farming in the Discovery Islands posed no more than a minimal risk to wild stocks, the Federal Court decision says. Bob Chamberlin, who chairs the First Nations Wild Salmon Alliance, said the industry\'s participation in the preparation of those reports, which is also noted in the court decision, raises questions for him about their independence.', 'image': 'https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/img/2022/04/26/fish.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:13:32'}

The UFLPA requires CBP to publish guidance on the due diligence and evidentiary standard needed to rebut the presumption after a formal rulemaking process.

During his trip to Europe last month, the president pledged the United States would welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians escaping from the violence in their home country due to Russian aggression. This new plan, he said, fulfills his prior commitment and ensures the Ukrainian people "need not go through our southern border."\n\nTo be eligible, Ukrainian applicants must have been in their home country as of February 11, 2022. In addition, they must: have a US-based sponsor, meet certain public health requirements, complete biometric screening and pass security vetting.\n\nDHS will accept and review applications to sponsor Ukrainian citizens from any US-based individual or organization, without any requirement of preexisting links to the Ukrainian nationals.

Martín Humberto Ponce Félix, 57, an alleged financial operator associated with Juan José “El Azul” Esparragoza Moreno, a former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, was visiting Mazatlán from his home in the state capital of Culiacán for the port city’s Motorcycle Week, an annual event that draws thousands of domestic and international visitors.\n\nHis plans were cut short: as he rode his motorcycle through the high-rise hotels of Mazatlán’s “Golden Zone,” a gray Jeep took an illegal U-turn, sending Ponce flying. Paramedics determined at the scene that Ponce had suffered severe head injuries and he was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nLocal reports do not mention what happened to the Jeep or its driver.\n\nPonce had been blacklisted by the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) since 2012 for his connections to a number of gas stations accused of laundering money for Sinaloa Cartel leader “El Azul.” “El Azul” was widely reported to have died in 2014 at the age of 65, but authorities were unable to verify his death.\n\nLater the same day, armed gunmen killed another man along Mazatlán’s beachfront, near the Fisherman’s Monument. The victim, Francisco “N” of Tijuana, age 45, was in town along with family members to participate in Motorcycle Week.\n\nFrancisco was seated on his motorcycle outside a restaurant at the time of the attack, early Friday evening. Witnesses said that at least two armed men on motorcycles shot him at close range. Before police arrived, the attackers escaped into the crowd, where hundreds of motorcycles and pedestrians had gathered.\n\nAccording to Civil Protection, at least 18,000 people attended Mazatlán Motorcycle Week this year.\n\nOn the same day farther south, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) lost a financial operative of its own. Saúl “N,” alias “El Chopa,” was killed in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, after a firefight with the federal forces.\n\nThe National Guard was carrying out “preventative intelligence” operations in the upscale neighborhood of Marina Vallarta when they were attacked, the Department of Defense (Sedena) said in a statement. The National Guard returned fire, injuring El Chopa. He and his bodyguard were arrested and El Chopa was taken to a hospital but succumbed to his injuries and died shortly after.\n\nHe was allegedly the top financial manager for the CJNG. His responsibilities included supplying arms and tactical equipment to CJNG cells, and he was linked to the murder of Jalisco ex-governor Aristóteles Sandoval, Sedena said.\n\nBack north in Sonora, another Sinaloa Cartel-related incident occurred in the town of Pitiquito on Thursday, when a group known as Los Cazadores (“the Hunters”) tore down several houses belonging to their rivals. Los Cazadores are an armed cell controled by Los Chapitos, the four sons of notorious drug trafficker Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and part of the current Sinaloa Cartel leadership.\n\nWith reports from El Sol de Mazatlán, El Debate and Infobae', 'image': 'https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Less-graphic-Twitter.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:13:57'}

Culiacán, Sinaloa, was briefly turned into a battlefield with blocked avenues, burning vehicles, convoys of armed vehicles and heavily armed men. Amid the threat of civilian turmoil, Ovidio was released.\n\nTwo of the leaders of Los Cazadores were arrested in April and June last year.\n\nThe Sinaloa Cartel and other cartels have shifted their concentration from naturally grown drugs such as marijuana and opium to the manufacture and distribution of more powerful synthetic drugs.

There are no more documents left to produce by President Trump.”\n\nShe also derided the James probe as a “political crusade” and “truly a fishing expedition,” saying Trump and his companies had turned over more than 6 million documents and paperwork related to 103 Trump entities for an eight-year period.\n\n“We’ve turned over everything as fast as possible. This is a waste of judicial resources,” Habba added.\n\nShe also defended Trump’s character, saying: “My client is an honest person much to the dismay of certain people in this room.”\n\nTrump spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nInvestigators for James have said in court filings that they uncovered evidence that Trump may have misstated the value of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers on his financial statements for more than a decade.\n\nAt the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Amer said the investigation was being hampered “because we don’t have evidence from the person at the top of this organization.”\n\nAnd he said the failure to turn documents over in response to the subpoena was “effectively Mr. Trump thumbing his nose at this court’s order.”\n\nStill, Assistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace signaled the probe was about to move to a new phase, saying: “We plan to bring enforcement action in the near future.”\n\nA parallel criminal investigation is being conducted by the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, also a Democrat.\n\nMonday’s contempt finding was not the first for someone who has held the nation’s highest office.\n\nWhile in the White House, then-President Bill Clinton was found in civil contempt of court in April 1999 in connection to his deposition in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him in Arkansas by Paula Jones.\n\nJudge Susan Webber Wright held him in contempt for his testimony, where he falsely said he hadn’t had a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

The message was delivered to the Commons foreign affairs committee by the head of Gavi, the international organization leading the distribution of vaccines to the developing world, and a senior United Nations Children\'s Agency official. Seth Berkley, the head of Gavi, said while Canada is offering fourth doses of COVID-19 vaccines and has a vaccination rate above 80 per cent of the population, the global rate is just 59 per cent. Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don\'t miss out. He said in the poorest 18 countries, less than 10 per cent of people are fully vaccinated. Berkley said with 2.7 billion people unvaccinated around the world COVID-19 has ample space to mutate into new variants, including the recent Omicron strain, which is sickening triple-vaccinated people in the developed world.\n\n"Even though many countries with high coverage have now relaxed restrictions and reopened their societies, we are still in a state of global crisis," said Berkley. "So far, a new variant has emerged roughly every four to five months, and globally, nothing has changed to give us reason to believe that this pattern won\'t continue." Lily Caprani, the head of global health, vaccines and pandemic response for UNICEF, said it is in the "enlightened self-interest" of countries such as Canada to increase vaccination rates everywhere, otherwise there will be a continuing cycle of new variants emerging. Trans Mountain pipeline insurers dropping like flies "As we know, a new variant continues to emerge every four months or so and the threat is not over, either to those vulnerable populations, or to any country — even with high vaccine coverage," Caprani said.\n\nWhat\'s more, said Caprani, while COVID-19 might not have posed the greatest risk to children compared to other groups, the pandemic has caused them a generation\'s worth of harm in other ways. School closures, lack of access to maternal and newborn health care and a decline in immunizations of other preventable diseases has led to a re-emergence of measles and polio, she added. "Children are a kind of hidden victims of the pandemic," she said. New #variants will fuel COVID pandemic unless global vaccine rate rises: #Gavi, #UNICEF. #Covid19 #CDNPoli Caprani and Berkley told the committee that the problem of vaccine supply — which led to widespread criticism last year that Canada and other countries were vaccine hoarders — is no longer the prevailing problem. There are now plenty of manufactured vaccine doses available, but less-developed countries lack the capacity to actually get people vaccinated. They cited a range of factors from damaged or inadequate health-care systems to vaccine hesitancy, to a lack of health-care workers and basic supplies, such as syringes, to inject vaccines into willing arms. International Development Minister Harjit Sajjan noted the capacity shortcomings on a recent trip to western Africa and said he planned to look for ways to target Canada\'s aid spending to areas where it could be most useful.\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada was increasing its contribution to COVAX, the international vaccine sharing alliance that Gavi is leading, to $700 million to help purchase, deliver and distribute COVID-19 vaccines to lower-income countries. NDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson told the committee she did not want to see rich countries cut back on their overall international development spending as they roll out fourth doses for their own populations. "There\'s this sort of feeling that COVID-19 is over, that we can change the channel that we can turn the page. And I think both our witnesses today have made it very, very clear that we are not out of this pandemic."', 'image': 'https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/img/2022/04/26/9fa3c04317b45bc3d9a9229d2d587605423c6e795d4c2a4131bd78aad9b7ee0e.jpg_newsroom_base.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:40'}

From coast to coast to coast, people turned out in unprecedented numbers to help protect themselves, their families and communities from COVID‑19. Thanks to these efforts, we are getting us back to doing the things we love, while growing the economy and creating good jobs.\n\n“To date, over 85 per cent of eligible people in Canada are vaccinated with two doses, and more than 18 million Canadians have already received booster shots. We know that vaccines are one of the best tools to help fight COVID-19 and I encourage Canadians who have not received their vaccines and boosters to do so as soon as they can.\n\n“This pandemic further illustrated what we have known for a long time: vaccination is a proven and effective public health tool. Vaccines have contributed to protecting generations of Canadians from diseases that put our health at risk and threaten our lives. During the pandemic, many in Canada and around the world have fallen behind in routine vaccinations for other vaccine-preventable diseases, so I encourage all Canadians to stay up to date on their routine vaccinations, such as annual flu vaccines.\n\n“Delivering safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and strengthening Canada’s life sciences and bio manufacturing capabilities has been a key part of keeping Canadians healthy, while creating jobs and growing the economy. The Government of Canada is investing in bio manufacturing, supporting the development of domestic vaccine and therapeutic candidates, and advancing targeted research to help enhance Canada’s resilience and innovation capabilities. More than $1.6 billion have been invested to support 30 projects, from AbCellera in Vancouver to BioVectra in Charlottetown. Through these efforts, we are better equipped to continue responding effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic and deal with future pandemics by leveraging Canada’s industrial capabilities and world-leading science.\n\n“To end the pandemic anywhere, we have to end it everywhere. On the world stage, Canada is delivering millions of vaccines to those who need it most, while ensuring the equitable distribution of COVID‑19 tests, treatments, and vaccines through Access to COVID‑19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator.\n\n“This National Immunization Awareness Week, I want to join all Canadians in thanking the front-line immunizers, health care workers, public health professionals, and scientific researchers across Canada who all continue to work hard to help keep us safe and healthy.

In the course of a few weeks in March and April, there were a series of what felt like conflicting announcements. In late March, Ottawa released its Emissions Reduction Plan, which included a trajectory to drive down emissions generated by oil and gas production in Canada. A week later, the IPCC released its latest report on the deepening climate emergency, imploring countries to rapidly and substantially reduce their use of fossil fuels. Meanwhile — also in March — Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson announced that Canada could increase oil and gas exports this year by up to 300,000 barrels per day to help buttress the global supply amidst Russian aggression in Ukraine. Shortly afterwards, the federal government approved a new offshore oil project in Newfoundland and Labrador. Get top stories in your inbox. Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. How do we make sense of these developments when they seem to undercut each other on such a regular basis? A good way of thinking about it is to consider medium- and long-term needs versus short-term demands.\n\nLong-term climate action not at odds with energy security The Russian invasion of Ukraine has prompted the world to search for secure and immediately available energy supplies. In the short term, if European countries are to apply deeper sanctions on Russia and ultimately stop buying its product, they need to find new suppliers of oil and gas — which is why EU leaders continue to pressure the OPEC nations to increase production. Trans Mountain pipeline insurers dropping like flies But in the longer term, Europe’s response to events in Ukraine has been to stick to decarbonization efforts and accelerate investment in renewables. For example, it is committed to its Fit for 55 plan to reduce natural gas use 30 per cent by 2030 and is considering accelerating investment in wind and solar power in the next few years to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Plans to institute a Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanism — which will impose new taxes on imports from countries that are less ambitious than the EU on climate — forge ahead.\n\nPut simply: the answer to the energy security question can look very different if you take an immediate or longer-term view. The key is to make sure the solutions we choose to meet our short-term needs do not jeopardize our longer-term climate imperatives. In the face of a climate emergency, our approach to energy security today must be consistent with a responsible approach to climate change and the need to reduce our carbon emissions. Change has begun Despite the volatility of global oil markets in the last few months, the current pace at which governments are introducing climate policies — and associated changes to the way we produce and consume energy — is not far off from the International Energy Agency’s Announced Pledges Scenario, which forecasts a plateau and decline in demand for oil in this decade. Oil majors BP and Equinor forecast a peak in oil demand before 2030, even without more ambitious climate action. Opinion: In the face of a climate emergency, our approach to energy security today must be consistent with a responsible approach to climate change and the need to reduce our carbon emissions, writes Janetta McKenzie. #ClimateAction #COP26 Take sales of electric vehicles for example, which increased globally and in Canada during the pandemic and continue to outpace International Energy Agency projections of what is needed to reach a net-zero transportation sector by 2050. As consumers continue to make the switch to EVs, their need for oil will further decrease (and will be replaced by increased demand for electricity, which is why the Pembina Institute is working with the federal government on moving Canada’s grid to net-zero). According to data from the International Energy Agency, EVs represented just over two per cent of vehicle sales globally in 2019; by the end of 2021, market share had risen to nine per cent. Early figures from 2022 indicate that this trend continues, despite supply chain challenges.\n\nFigure 1: Global market share of EVs over time. In light of this pace of change, it is important to consider what federal policies, such as the carbon price, are designed to do. Earlier this month, Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon wrote about the federal government’s Emissions Reduction Plan, which he wrongly asserted included policies to cut production in the oil and gas sector that would “destroy Alberta’s economy.” Rather, policies aimed at decarbonization will shield the economy from global economic and political trends that are already having and will continue to have, significant impacts on Canadian industry.", 'image': 'https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/img/2022/04/23/ukraine_war_photo_flickr.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:18'}

This climate series is designed to inform and inspire Canadian prosperity, while advancing RBC’s ongoing commitment to speak up for smart climate solutions, a key pillar of RBC’s Climate Blueprint.\n\nClimate change, meet energy security\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is a cataclysmic moment for global energy markets. As governments and consumers grapple with energy shortages and high gas and power bills, climate change policies are being thrust into competition with energy security.\n\nThe old energy order is giving way to a new, disorderly one as Europe and Asia seek alternate supplies to replace Russian exports. Moscow’s ploy to exploit Europe’s energy vulnerability will not be forgotten in a hurry, and has accelerated two contradictory responses: rapid decarbonization and a scramble to raise fossil fuel production at least in the short term.\n\nThe dichotomy underscores a hard truth: short of major additional action, oil and gas will likely remain critical and contentious energy sources for longer than some think.\n\nThis poses some critical questions for the West:\n\nShould Canada and the U.S. raise production significantly in the short term to cool prices?\n\nHow does higher output square with their ambitious emissions reduction plans?\n\nIf governments fail to balance climate action and energy security, will high energy costs and emissions erode public trust?\n\nCanada can still reach its 2050 Net Zero targets, but it may not be a linear journey.\n\nThe Canadian government has called for more oil and gas production to help ease the global crisis in the short run, while maintaining a firm commitment to competitive and decarbonized oil and gas in the long run.\n\nOur research shows both goals are within reach—but at significant cost. Canada can still reach its 2050 Net Zero targets, but it may not be a linear journey.\n\nCrucially, Canada can still reach its 2050 Net Zero targets, but it may not be a linear journey. There isn’t a moment to lose. Policy action over the next 24 months must chart Canada’s climate-and-energy path to Net Zero by 2050.\n\nKey findings\n\nCanada’s oil and gas sector can support near-term energy security while advancing climate action, but will need regulatory certainty and support at all levels of government.\n\nOil sands and conventional producers could raise production by up to 500,000 barrels per day from 2021 levels.\n\n\n\nThis could add 9 million tonnes of greenhouse gases per year, costing at least $1.5 billion annually to abate—but bringing potential net benefits of $10.5 billion annually. Critically, if Canadian barrels displace those of other producers, there would be no additional global emissions.\n\nMeeting climate targets despite new production will demand significant investment in methane reductions, as well as electrification and carbon capture across industries.\n\nCutting emissions 40% from current levels in the oil sands by 2030 will likely require $45 billion to $65 billion in capital spending between 2024 and 2030, peaking at about $9 billion per year mid-decade.\n\nFull upstream decarbonization with carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), a critical emissions-reduction technology, will require oil prices averaging roughly US$50 WTI through 2050.\n\nA deliberate approach to deploying decarbonization technology in the oil sands is needed to avoid over-investing in costly solutions. CCUS should be viewed as just one tool at Canada’s disposal.\n\nCHAPTER 1: Oil is here for the long haul\n\nCHAPTER 2: Canada’s role in ensuring energy security\n\nCHAPTER 3: The need for CCUS\n\nCHAPTER 4: Can Net Zero oil sands compete in global markets?\n\nCHAPTER 5: Managing volatility in the investment cycle\n\nKey ideas to move forward\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nOil is here for the long haul\n\nThe journey to decarbonization was never going to be smooth. But it’s turning out to be a highly disruptive economic and political event.\n\nWhile energy security and climate change have long been on a collision course, Moscow’s aggression has brought the conflict to a head. Early indications suggest at least 3 million barrels per day of Russian oil could be shut in as buyers stay on the sidelines. In the longer term, a bigger portion of Russia’s 11.7 million bpd production could be challenged in the face of oil majors’ exits and as Moscow becomes an international pariah.\n\nThe Russian invasion has prompted calls to cut oil and gas demand by accelerating investments in clean energy technologies, a move that could blunt bad actors’ ability to hold energy markets hostage. But most countries would struggle to switch their energy sources rapidly over the next decade.\n\nFor example, zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) accounted for just 5.6% of Canadian light vehicle registrations in 20211. Given this modest starting point, it would take a Herculean effort to reach the ZEV mandates set out in Ottawa’s recently announced Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP). The mandate requires at least 60% of all new light-duty vehicle sales be ZEVs in 2030. Even if Canada meets that ambitious target, 84% of light vehicles will still run on gasoline by the end of the decade\n\nRussia’s actions in Ukraine have shocked energy markets but it’s still too early to know if the world will double-down on investments in renewable energy or lean on fossil fuels to manage the shortages. Most likely, both will see a wave of new investment.\n\nEarly estimates suggest global oil and gas capital expenditures will increase 11.6% year-on-year to US$533 billion in 2022. They’ll rise another 4% in 2023, before returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, according to Fitch Solutions.\n\nSo far, high fossil fuel prices have done little to curtail demand, at least in North America.\n\nWhile renewable energy investments are expected to rev up too, in Canada, there’s a renewed push for more oil production and a call for more pipelines. In the U.S., shale basins and Middle East oilfields are preparing to bring back mothballed rigs.\n\nAnd the world may be falling back into old consumption patterns. Germany plans to build LNG terminals even as it accelerates investments in renewables, while the IEA has recommended a temporary switch to coal and oil-fired electricity to wean the European Union off Russian gas. Both would add to, rather than cut, emissions.\n\nThe hurried response is aimed at protecting consumers from price spikes. Persistently high energy prices are cascading across energy-intensive industries, raising prices of staple commodities and denting the budgets of vulnerable households and small businesses. In such an environment, energy accessibility and affordability usually trump climate considerations for consumers.\n\nThere are already signs that government resolve is weakening: Germany, California, and British Columbia, usually climate leaders, are offering subsidies to offset high gasoline and power prices.\n\nSo far, high fossil fuel prices have done little to curtail demand, at least in North America. Consumers have room to absorb higher prices, since US gasoline costs are still nearly a full percentage point lower as a share of personal consumption expenditures than early in the 2000s, and Canadians have amassed major savings stockpiles during the pandemic.\n\nWhile there is regulatory and investor pressure on energy suppliers to rein in direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2), governments have tiptoed around the equally significant challenge of altering consumer behaviour.\n\nGlobally, explicit and implicit fossil-fuel subsidies primarily focused on the consumer stood at US$5.9 trillion in 2020, or about 6.8% of GDP. And they’re expected to rise to 7.4% of GDP by 2025, according to the International Monetary Fund. Consumer behaviour trends also suggest preference continues to take precedence over climate considerations: sales of SUVs soared 10% and accounted for 45% of all car sales last year, adding 120 million tonnes of CO2 annually.\n\nTaken together, these indicators suggest oil demand will rise rather than fall in this decade. The IEA’s short-term forecast pegs demand for oil at 104 million barrels per day in 2026, compared to around 99.7 million this year. Production growth over the next few years will be led by the United States, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq and Brazil.\n\nAbsent greater action, rising investment in clean energy doesn’t necessarily mean a decline in traditional energy sources.\n\nCanada’s contribution to higher output is also baked into the pie. The Canada Energy Regulator expects domestic production, led by the oil sands, to peak at 5.8 million bpd by 2032, before falling to 4.8 million bpd in 2050, assuming action to reduce GHG emissions continues at its current pace. If that’s the case, emissions would mostly rise, despite improvements in oil sands efficiency (which has fallen by a third since 1990.)\n\nSurging global energy demand\n\nEnergy demand over the past four decades has grown around 1.75% annually.\n\nWith global population set to rise by another 2 billion people by 2050, expect that demand to surge again. As a base case, the IEA projects energy demand will grow 1% annually over the next three decades.\n\nWhile renewable energy consumption is forecast to lead growth with a 3.2% annual increase between 2020 and 2050, oil demand is expected to rise by 0.5% and natural gas by 1.3% annually. Absent greater action, rising investment in clean energy doesn’t necessarily mean a decline in traditional energy sources.\n\nStill, a bullish scenario for oil markets is far from certain. The IEA’s less optimistic scenario pencils in a 25% decline in oil demand, with prices averaging US$64 per barrel. However, if a greater push emerges to get to Net Zero, prices drop as low as US$24. Net Zero production will be a prerequisite to sell into that shrinking oil market.\n\nThe trouble is, this base case for fossil fuel demand is at odds with climate goals.\n\nTo have a 50% chance of meeting a 1.5°C warming target (the stretch goal for the Paris Agreement), the world will need to leave 60% of the world’s remaining oil and gas, and 90% of its coal in the ground2.\n\nThat’s twice as much as a 2° scenario, and suggests we’ll need to hit peak global production soon—certainly within the decade.\n\nCompared to 1.5°, 2° could be even more destructive for the planet, with twice as many plants and animals seeing their habitats diminish, large swathes of sea coral becoming extinct, and millions more people facing heatwaves, floods, and water scarcity3.\n\nAgainst that bleak backdrop, Western oil production should not continue unrestricted no matter how acute the energy security imperatives. To resolve that tension, new Western production must displace other sources, to stabilize global emissions (including Scope 3 emissions that include an organization’s upstream and downstream emissions), and policymakers must redouble efforts to drive down oil demand.\n\nCanada has the tools and technologies needed to rapidly deploy renewable power, electrify buildings and transport infrastructure, and, in some cases, industry. But managing the impact of intermittent renewables and the high cost of some alternatives will require careful planning, too.\n\nBut displacing development of fossil fuel resources elsewhere will be more challenging. Western economies need to be on the same page, targeting a growing Western share of oil production and falling overall oil demand. And they’ll need to agree to pay a premium for oil from climate-compliant producers.\n\nCanada and the U.S. should pursue a North America energy security alliance that secures both conventional energy, and the underlying resources for energy transition. Elements of such a strategy include long-term contracts with U.S. refineries that provide certainty for Canadian oil producers to invest in decarbonization, maintenance of existing pipelines and support for power transmission lines.\n\nCanada must ensure it receives consideration for its stability and energy decarbonization efforts. Long-term contracts could seek to put a floor on oil prices at levels that support decarbonization investments in Canada, and reduce the impact of extremely high oil prices for US consumers.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nCanada’s role in ensuring energy security\n\nEnergy is a critical sector for Canada. Oil and gas extraction and support activities, refining, distribution and transportation, could account for close to 10% of Canadian GDP in 2022. In addition to directly employing 178,500 Canadians, the industry supported 415,000 indirect jobs in 2020.\n\nResource-rich provincial governments benefit from royalties, which are expected to total at least $18 billion in 2022, up 50% from 2021 due to high energy prices and fully paid-down projects. 4\n\nGiven its sizeable resources, Canada can play a critical role in ensuring global energy security—that both addresses short-term energy shortages and burnishes Canada’s status as a soft power whose resource wealth can neutralize non-democratic forces. The challenge is to do so without threatening our climate goals.\n\nFirst, the good news. Canada can boost oil and gas exports to the U.S., which, in turn will raise the U.S.’s ability to expand energy supplies to the rest of the world.\n\nWe estimate that Canada can raise production by as much as 500,000 barrels per day through a combination of oil sands and conventional oil production to overcome supply deficits over the next year.\n\nWhile Canada’s exports are already at near record levels with an average of 3.76 million bpd in 2021, U.S.-destined pipeline capacity stands at more than 4 million bpd.\n\nOver the past few years, Canadian pipeline operators have invested in decongesting their systems to optimize capacity, but further notable increases may require new lines, according to industry.\n\nBut under a realistic production forecast, that may not be necessary. The Canada Energy Regulator’s latest forecast of 5.3 million bpd of pipeline and rail capacity by 2050 should be sufficient to handle Canadian production.\n\nAround 1 million bpd of total rail loading capacity suggests that, in a pinch, current oil export capacity can support near-term expansion. However, railway companies will be challenged to supply specialized rail cars and juggle demand from agriculture, food and minerals producers already struggling with supply chain challenges in order to accommodate higher oil shipments.\n\nCanadian takeaway capacity is sufficient\n\nSource: Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, Canada Energy Regulator\n\nThe bad news: rising production could challenge Canada’s recently-announced ERP target to cut oil and gas sector emissions by 42% as new production adds as many as 9 million tonnes of additional emissions.\n\nLaying the Foundation for Emissions Cuts Required under Canada’s Net Zero legislation, the Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) and the subsequent federal budget marked a tone-shift for climate policy. The document outlined emissions targets at the sectoral level, and provided significant new funding for transportation, carbon capture, and nature-based climate solutions. Read More But when it comes to the all-important energy sector, it was short on details. Mindful of a war in Ukraine and a full-blown global energy crisis that is still unfolding, the ERP underscored the dilemma of setting aspirational climate goals at a time of structural disruption in energy markets. The ERP assumes rising Canadian oil production. But recent announcements pay more attention to new projects’ emissions rather than their economic benefits. The message from Ottawa is, increasingly, that only the lowest-carbon operations will be given social license to produce. It will be a challenge, but we believe Canada can accelerate oil production and achieve its stated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by the end of the decade.\n\nThere are no guarantees. The industry may not respond to the call to raise production without resetting emissions targets and obtaining social licence. Investors have prioritized dividends and buybacks over ploughing back profits to generate more barrels, while labour shortages and stringent ESG targets are further discouraging a push to raise production.\n\nShould oil prices rise further, that may not be the case. But to secure more energy supplies, Canadian policymakers should signal greater comfort with a short-term rise in oil emissions—as long as emissions start to fall in other areas, or oil production starts coming offline beyond 2030.\n\nAt the same time, policy makers can pull other levers to ensure we remain close to our 2030 emissions targets. Rising oil sector emissions can be offset with cuts elsewhere, such as by accelerating renewable power infrastructure and building decarbonization, and improving energy efficiency. The economic benefit of rising oil production can help offset the cost of accelerating other sectors’ decarbonization, especially buildings and electricity, where supply chain bottlenecks may be less severe than transportation.\n\nOverall, there’s no need for near-term energy security challenges to threaten the world’s commitment to Net Zero. But cross-sector trade-offs won’t work in the long term. Canadian oil producers will need to cut not just industry-average emissions, but overall emissions in each type of production. Making the long term investments needed to do so requires clarity, and there’s no better clarifying moment than an energy crisis.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nThe need for CCUS\n\nWhile supporting near-term energy security and meeting future climate targets will be challenging, our report $2 Trillion Transition: Canada’s Road to Net Zero found that technologies to achieve deep cuts are readily available for transportation, buildings and electricity.\n\nThe ERP already targets 42% emissions cuts in the oil and gas sector, nearly 40% of which come from the oil sands, where cuts are costly and technically difficult. This will be challenging to achieve, given the industry’s reliance on capital-intensive carbon capture projects for deep cuts.\n\nDevelopment of the recently-approved Bay du Nord oil field off the coast of Newfoundland, which may only start producing oil in the late-2020s, could add some 4.5 million tonnes over the life of the project.\n\nBut conventional oil and natural gas producers appear well placed to cut emissions over the next decade. For one, their emissions are lower per barrel, due to lower energy input. For another, about 40% of upstream natural gas emissions, and two-thirds of conventional oil emissions come from methane releases and leaks. These are slated for a 75% reduction by 2030 via widespread leak detection and vapour recovery units, making up nearly the entire contribution of cuts in the ERP.\n\nMore effort to electrify facilities near B.C.’s clean electricity grid to address combustion could deepen cuts and make room within the sector for rising production. In the medium term, with greater effort by utilities to bring electricity to more parts of B.C. and Alberta’s oil and gas fields, deeper decarbonization is possible.\n\nTypes of bitumen production\n\nShovel Ready Mining: Shovel-Ready\n\nOnly a fifth of the oil sands deposit can be extracted by mining. Massive shovels scoop out the bitumen and ship it on large trucks to cleaning facilities where it is separated from sand, water and clay, or tailings. The waste material is sent to tailings ponds.\n\nCurrent production (2020): 1.49 million bpd Production forecast (2030): 1.70 million bpd\n\nThe separated oil is processed in two ways: Synthetic Crude Oil\n\nSynthetic crude oil (SCO): Once stripped of the waste, the bitumen is converted to a sweet, synthetic crude oil (SCO), in upgraders, or complex heavy oil refineries. While the process adds to the oil’s emissions at the upstream stage, the lighter, sulphur-free end product can be sold to a conventional refinery. Average emissions intensity (2014-18): 95 kg/bbl Froth treatment\n\nMined dilbit or paraffinic froth treatment (PFT): Two new oil sands projects, Imperial Oil’s Kearl Oil Sands Project and Suncor Energy-led Fort Hills, use the PFT method. The process removes the bitumen’s heaviest components and is diluted with lighter blends to produce dilbit. PFT uses a paraffinic solvent as diluent, producing a clean end product that can be transported without the need to upgrade, thereby reducing upstream emissions. Average emissions intensity (2014-18): 46 kg CO2/bbl In Situ: Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) In Situ: Cycle Steam Stimulation (SAGD)\n\nIf Canada is serious about cutting oil sands emissions by 2030, the first move is to bring down emissions intensity—the CO2 emitted per barrel—with production efficiencies. But this isn’t likely to bring emissions on track to meet our climate goals.\n\nWithout new facilities dragging down average carbon emissions5, oil sands emissions per barrel could improve about 6 to 7% by 2030. Some of these improvements would come at high costs6. Others are only economical for new facilities, or those not yet past the prototype stage.\n\nOver the long term, breakthrough technologies that provide low- or no-carbon steam, like hydrogen boilers and small modular nuclear reactors, could revolutionize oil sands production, as both provide zero-carbon sources of heat and power. Unlike conventional producers, who consistently need to drill new wells, and move emissions-controlling equipment each time, the stationary nature and slow decline rate of oil sands may improve the economics of costlier equipment like reactors.\n\nUntil then, carbon capture is the key technology for cutting emissions deeply. The IEA and UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have both identified CCUS as a technology that can help cut emissions with conducive policies, public support and innovation.\n\nMost CCUS projects to date, in Canada and elsewhere, have been heavily subsidized by tax credits or government investments.\n\nBut the technology is not without significant drawbacks: it’s pricey, slow to build, adds costs, relies on complex engineering, and sometimes fails to capture or store emissions effectively. The technology also needs to be tested in large- scale settings. As yet, there are no major plants that capture CO2 from the combustion of natural gas, which is the primary application for the oil sands. And with just 40 million tonnes per year of existing capturing capacity globally, a near-term buildout of 20 to 30 million tonnes in Canada appears ambitious.\n\nWhat’s more: CCUS projects don’t inherently have financial returns. The product they make, CO2, has minimal market value, so returns need to be engineered from government policy, like carbon pricing or fuel standards. And in many cases, the avoided taxes or regulatory payments are highly uncertain.\n\nAccordingly, most CCUS projects to date, in Canada and elsewhere, have been heavily subsidized by tax credits or government investments. Or have required corporations to voluntarily pay very high carbon prices. To justify government investment, we need to be sure oil sands production at scale is competitive in the long run.\n\nTo justify government investment, we need to be sure oil sands production at scale is competitive in the long run.\n\nEmissions Catchers: Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage Projects in Canada CCUS projects in operation, under construction and proposed View slideshow\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nCan Net Zero oil sands compete in global markets?\n\nThe Oil Sands Pathways Initiative, an industry group aimed at getting the oil sands to Net Zero, is targeting targeting 22 million tonnes (Mt) in emissions cuts by 2030. To accelerate investment in CCUS, the recent federal budget announced a refundable investment tax credit totaling a little less than 50% of project costs to 2030. This is a significant step in the right direction, and should help spur studies of, and investment in, the best CCUS sites.7\n\nBut for widespread deployment—government modelling implies some 15 to 18 Mt of installed capacity by 2030—more effort from provinces will be needed. This could include a top-up on the credit, but also improvements to non-financial parts of CCUS projects like permitting, liability, and storage rights. The government’s commitment to explore carbon pricing certainty could also help de-risk cash flows from CCUS projects.\n\nAnd to make an equal contribution to Canada’s 2030 target, we think the overall ambition needs to grow, deploying around 30 Mt of carbon capture in the next eight years.\n\nDoing so would require between $45 and $65 billion in total capital spending between 2024 and 2030, totaling $9 billion per year at its peak. This would be a significant draw relative to the industry’s current investment levels. Assuming the government continues to absorb half the bill, total taxpayer costs would be significant, too.\n\nWhile previous rounds of high oil prices have led to investment booms, the short-term landscape has changed. After a turbulent few years, oil sector investors prefer to see firms focus on dividends and share buybacks rather than invest in expensive carbon capture projects.\n\nThe long-term outlook also challenges major investments in oil sands projects, especially as most forecasts have oil demand falling in the coming decades, as drivers switch to electric vehicles. A major push for decarbonization to reduce demand for Russian oil and gas in Europe may accelerate this trend.\n\nIn that context, Canada’s challenge rests in removing carbon emissions from the oil sands without making them uneconomical to extract.\n\nWe estimate full decarbonization of the oil sands8 could cost between $6 and $14 per barrel for mined bitumen and $17 and $23 for in situ bitumen. Overall, WTI would have to average about US$50 over the life of the project to meet investor expectations. While that has largely been the case since 2005, uncertain future demand means that may be a high bar.\n\nThat said, oil sands wells decline more slowly than conventional ones, making them more suitable for site-specific and immobile CCUS. If CCUS remains a key technology for decarbonizing oil, that may be a structural advantage for oil sands producers. Ignoring sunk capital costs, steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) facilities with CCUS could run profitably at prices as low as US$40.\n\nThese relatively high abatement costs mean Canadian producers should take a pragmatic approach to CCUS. Deploying investments gradually through the 2020s and 2030s would allow for cost efficiencies and leave room for future technologies to potentially lower costs. A slower approach is at loggerheads with deep emissions cuts this decade, but a measured, realistic approach to decarbonizing heavy oil production will be critical to maintain Canada’s economic competitiveness in the sector.\n\nIn the long term, given a majority of emissions from oil consumption come from burning the fuel, industry will need to invest in developing uses for bitumen that don’t require combustion. IEA forecasts put non-combustion demand near 15 million barrels per day in 2050, for things such as lubricants, waxes and asphalt. Opportunities to take the heaviest parts of Canadian barrels and make value-added products like carbon fibre are in the early stages of innovation, but could be a key for diversification and transition in the oil sands.\n\nOf course, this may yet be challenged by emissions reduction mandates levied by government and the significant uncertainty around future oil and carbon prices. We’ll need a coordinated effort by industry and government to address these challenges.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nManaging volatility in the investment cycle\n\nThe oil sector is highly cyclical, which makes long term investments difficult especially when coupled with the uncertainty of returns for decarbonization projects. For one, it’s likely oil production and emissions will fluctuate through 2050 as prices encourage or discourage investment. Investing billions of dollars in CCUS during periods of price weakness will be challenging, and boom-and-bust weary investors may be reluctant to fund large-scale, long horizon projects even when prices are high.\n\nAt the same time, record cash flow of an estimated US$150 billion for Canadian oil and gas producers this year, and expectations that high prices will persist for some time, make allocating public funds to decarbonize the oil sector a greater political challenge amid high corporate profits.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a key goal for Canada should be to help smooth volatile investment cycles in the oil patch, and ensure consistent investment in the industry’s decarbonization. Federal and provincial governments should spread out the significant windfall revenues they accrue during high price periods to help sustain investment when the industry is struggling. And firms should commit to funding decarbonization even if oil prices falter.\n\nThe Canada Growth Fund is an important shift in the government’s approach, promising new investment structures and formalized involvement in emissions-cutting projects. While co-investing with industry in abatement projects improves financial returns, there are still significant roadblocks to large decarbonization projects. Policy uncertainty, permitting and regulatory snarls, sub-surface rights for carbon storage and liability if it leaks, and the risks associated with early stage technologies can still delay investment.\n\nTo deliberately deploy enough investment to meet rapidly approaching targets in the sector, an energy-focused stream within the Growth Fund needs to bring the right stakeholders around a single table to streamline and expedite project approvals.\n\nResource-rich provinces, the energy and financial industries, regulators, utilities and outside experts can partner with the Growth Fund to jointly address these roadblocks.\n\nTo reduce uncertainty, investment in oil and gas decarbonization during low price periods could see higher public contributions than during periods when industry cash flow is high, demonstrating government support when times are tougher.\n\nCrucially, it must have some independence from the political cycle. Rather than additional budgetary allotments, public funding should be directly segregated from existing royalties and federal corporate taxes to ensure funding stability.\n\nCanada Growth Fund’s energy stream: Who does what?

They must commit to making decarbonization a priority throughout the investment cycle.\n\nKey ideas to move forward To ensure energy and climate security, the federal government and key provinces, the private sector and Indigenous communities will need to take critical steps in the near future. Some ideas:\n\nACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN OIL MARKET STABILITY Avoid emissions policy that restricts or cuts near-term domestic production at a time when Western Canadian oil is addressing current market disruptions. Beyond 2030, significant efforts should be made to curtail and even wind down projects that are not aligned with Canada’s Net Zero goals. Decarbonization technologies and processes should be embedded in business models of all new projects. Leverage the Canada Growth Fund to smooth investment cycles in the oil and gas space. Spending could incorporate larger public contributions in periods of lower oil prices and more private funding at high prices. Ensure any emissions cap is forward-looking. Seek greater effort in natural gas and conventional production than oil sands, and aim for falling emissions over the medium term. ACCELERATE & DIVERSIFY EMISSION CUTS Offset slower progress on oil emissions with other decarbonization efforts, including building retrofits, ZEV subsidies, and electrical transmission infrastructure. Develop new abatement technologies that maintain cost efficiencies. The Canadian Innovation and Investment Agency, introduced in Budget 2022, should also include a stream for the most promising early-stage abatement technologies and non-combustion uses for oil. Diversify energy investment. While oil and gas will be key fuels for climate transition, electricity and new energy technologies such as hydrogen are gaining momentum. Canada’s energy firms should aspire to broaden their asset portfolio and develop expertise in low-carbon and sustainable technologies that would complement fossil fuel exports. TAP INTO INDIGENOUS EXPERTISE Continue to ensure Indigenous groups are key partners in new energy systems. Equity participation in new infrastructure and energy projects would foster support from partners with local expertise, speeding development. Ensuring Indigenous communities receive upside and ownership, as well as the economic benefit of projects, are key pathways to advance meaningful economic reconciliation and inclusion. FORGE ENERGY ALLIANCES Resolve key energy trade issues with the United States at the highest political level to overcome state and provincial hurdles. Develop a North American energy alliance with a high-level summit that broadly aligns U.S. and Canada on market access issues including cross-border pipelines, alignment of fuel standards and border carbon adjustments. Work with international partners to create demand certainty. Aim for long-term oil contracts with the U.S. and Europe to price in environmental efforts, governance and geopolitical stability to ensure the most stable producers remain key suppliers of Net Zero oil. Similarly, cultivate deeper energy ties with Asian economies such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to bring energy market stability. Greater trade ties could also open the door for export-focused liquefied natural gas and hydrogen joint ventures with Asian countries.\n\nAppendix 1. https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/automotive-insights-canadian-ev-information-analysis-q4-21.html\n\n2. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03821-8\n\n3. https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/\n\n4. https://www.arcenergyinstitute.com/meet-the-new-boom-different-from-the-last-boom/\n\n5. e.g., new mines built with paraffinic froth treatment, new or expansion SAGD facilities with solvents or lower SORs; derived from IHS markit estimates\n\n6. e.g., petroleum coke boiler replacements, which industry may avoid in favour of CCUS if project economics improve\n\n7.

There is no shortage of apocalyptic predictions here, with many people suggesting it will empower right-wing politicians and further coarsen an already nasty public political discourse. There are also plenty of well-informed calls for calm and restraint, along with reminders that Twitter’s previous owners (including, most notably, founder Jack Dorsey) weren’t exactly the best stewards.

For his part, Musk seemed to strike a less juvenile tone in his announcement about the deal. “I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,” he said.\n\n“Twitter has tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.” In fairness to Musk, it’s not like Twitter is some digital Garden of Eden right now. Yes, it begrudgingly removed Donald Trump, along with fellow travellers like Alex Jones, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Milo Yiannopoulos. But it is still plagued by the influence of foreign-controlled bot farms, which have contributed massively to the spread of misinformation about COVID-19, among other sensitive subjects. There is a chance that a privately owned Twitter won’t feel the same need to artificially inflate its user data with them as the publicly traded one did and could therefore kick them off the platform entirely.

This would represent a significant legal threat to any elected politicians who lose their seats, they would lose legal protections such as the right to be tried only in the supreme court.\n\nThe list of possible allegations against the Bolsonaro administration include collusion with armed militias in Rio de Janeiro, spreading fake news, corruption and embezzlement of public funds and, in the president’s case, his catastrophic handling of the public health crisis of COVID-19, which has already been part of a public inquiry.\n\nThroughout his political career, Bolsonaro, like Trump, has repeatedly revealed his contempt for democratic institutions and playing by the rules. He praised the military coup of 1964 (calling it “the second Independence Day”), and the practices of that military regime, which tortured and murdered political opponents.\n\nAs a federal legislator for Rio de Janeiro, he claimed that the dictatorship should have killed “at least 30,000” citizens, among them the then president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. One of Bolsanaro’s pledges, while campaigning in 2018, was to reward police officers for killing criminal suspects.\n\nOnce elected president, he praised Rio de Janeiro’s police for shooting dead 28 people during a raid on a favela. As head of state he has also consistently resisted any limitations imposed on him, whether by the provisions of the constitution, the actions of the opposition, the checks and balances built into the federal separation of powers, or critical press coverage.\n\nLike Trump, Bolsonaro started this process of undermining confidence in the democratic process some time ago by claiming that elections were fraudulent.\n\nHe has repeatedly questioned both the electronic voting and vote-counting process, and the impartiality of the electoral courts which organize and regulate elections in Brazil.\n\nHis attacks on the reliability of the electoral system have been reinforced by the mass distribution of digital misinformation through social media.\n\nHis fake news strategy, targeting his electoral rivals, was unleashed first by his campaign team and supporters.\n\nIn October 2018, elections for state and federal deputies were held concurrently with the presidential ballot, and some legislative candidates on the same party ticket as Bolsonaro spread rumors about the soundness of the electoral process. Fernando Francischini, a Bolsonaro supporter, who was elected state deputy in Paraná, in the south of Brazil, alleged, without any evidence, that some electronic ballot boxes had prevented people from voting for Bolsonaro and had been seized.\n\nJudges at the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) ruled in October 2021 that this had not occurred, and Francischini was stripped of his seat for disseminating digital disinformation in 2018.\n\nSince then the lie has been repeated over and over by Bolsonaro, who even tried to jettison Brazil’s well-regarded electronic voting system, introduced in the late 1990s, with a paper-based one, which had proven more susceptible to fraud and abuse in the past.\n\nWhile there have been no cases of proven electronic manipulation of electoral results in Brazil, all electronic systems have potential vulnerabilities and a lack of information contributes to high levels of public distrust that can be exploited.\n\nIn any case, the constitutional amendment failed to get the necessary votes in congress to pass and the TSE, noted that, while the court would not act on the misconduct in 2018, it would punish any repetition in 2022: “the registration of candidacies will be canceled and those who engage in this activity will go to jail”.\n\nAccording to the Bolsonaro’s faithful supporters, a plot has been hatched between the polling institutes, opposition parties, corrupt elites in the judiciary, the press, and even social media companies, to prevent his re-election and put his nemesis, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, back in power. The 2021 decision by the supreme court to overturn Lula’s convictions for corruption, which had kept him out of the political picture in 2018, is seen as part of this ruse.\n\nBolsonaro’s attacks on the political system are escalating ahead of the elections. Some of his staunchest supporters are military police officers and security personnel and firearms registrations have surged under Bolsonaro’s deregulation of gun ownership, raising fears of a situation like the invasion on the US Capitol. Brazil’s democratic institutions will have to work hard to maintain the legitimacy of the system and ensure a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nFiona Macaulay is professor of Gender, Peace and Development at University of Bradford\n\nCláudio Gonçalves Couto is Associate professor at Brazilian School of Public and Business Administration (EBAPE/FGV)\n\nThis article was originally published in The Conversation.

Not quite the crushing two-thirds of the vote Emmanuel Macron won five years ago. But almost every other winner of the French presidency would have been very happy with his score.\n\n"Is he lucky?"\n\nThat was the question Cardinal Mazarin always asked about prospective ministers. The cardinal was the right-hand man — the prime minister in all but name — of Louis XIV for almost two decades in the 1600s. Mazarin was apparently deeply superstitious, and only wanted "lucky" lieutenants.\n\nIn Macron\'s case, the answer has to be "yes."\n\nThe French president came to office five years ago promising to push through major change. Instead, major change pushed him and his government around.\n\nThere was a leaderless uprising in the smaller towns and countryside of France called "les gilets jaunes," or Yellow Vests, who resisted an "environmental" tax on diesel fuel that they claimed would drive poorer drivers into debt. (The tax was dropped.) Then, the devastation of COVID-19. Meanwhile, the eight-year French military expedition in several countries of sub-Saharan Africa, sent to wipe out ISIS groups, has largely failed. The French forces are pulling back and the extremists hold even more territory.\n\nBut Macron could rely on his luck.\n\nThe Yellow Vests exhausted themselves and the country three years ago — although it took months, not weeks as in Canada with the recent truckers\' protests.\n\nAfter a stuttering initial response to COVID-19, Macron\'s push to vaccinate the population earned grudging support from the majority of voters.\n\nAnd the African debacle has been completely overshadowed by war in Ukraine.\n\nA splintered opposition\n\nFrench presidential elections are run in two rounds. The first round is wide open; the second, two weeks later, is a runoff between the two candidates with the most votes in the first round.\n\nMacron\'s biggest luck lay in the lineup of opponents against him for the presidency this time around. There were no fewer than 11 candidates in the first round, splintering the opposition vote.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the French presidential candidate for the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party, salutes supporters after a speech at the Pavillon d\'Armenonville in Paris on April 24. She ended up getting 41.5 per cent of the vote. (Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFurther luck: far-right leader Marine Le Pen found herself battling for votes with Eric Zemmour, a man with even more pronounced extremist views. On Jan. 16, in the midst of the campaign, Zemmour was fined almost $15,000 by a Paris court for inciting racial hatred. He had said on television in 2020 that unaccompanied child migrants in France are "thieves," "rapists" and "murderers."\n\nZemmour called the court\'s decision "ideological and stupid." But he faded and Le Pen came second in the first round, almost five per cent behind Macron.\n\nLe Pen was running for president for a third time, the second time against Macron, the man she and many voters denounced as arrogant.\n\nThe incumbent president didn\'t so much defend his record as attack Le Pen\'s program. Macron said she was anti-Europe, anti-immigrant and beholden to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the candidates\' debate on April 20, Macron referred to a nine million euro ($14 million Cdn) loan her party obtained from a Kremlin-linked bank in 2014.\n\n"When you talk to Russia," Macron said to her, "you are not talking to its leaders; you are talking to your banker."\n\n\'A victory of relief\'\n\nThis was a killer line. Le Pen had been loud in her praise of Putin right up to his brutal invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.\n\nLe Pen also managed to fumble her strongest argument, the sharply rising cost of living. Macron pointed out that he had capped energy prices and was sending special cost-of-living cheques to the poorest voters while Le Pen proposed cutting the value added tax (VAT) across the board, which Macron said would benefit "people like you and me," who didn\'t need help nearly as much.\n\nAnd so he won. Macron is the first French president to be re-elected in 20 years, but commentators like Brice Teinturier, of the polling institute Ipsos, called it "more a victory of relief. Hope seems quite absent from the result of this election."\n\nEven Macron seemed pensive in his victory speech. "I know that many people voted for me not in support of my ideas, but to block the extreme right."\n\nThese defaced campaign posters for Macron and Le Pen in southwestern France demonstrate the broader discontent with the choice of candidates in the runoff in the 2022 presidential election. (Bob Edme/The Associated Press)\n\nHis speech was short and sober. The election-night party under the Eiffel Tower was over by 10 p.m. European leaders rushed to show their relief and congratulate the president. Macron\'s ministers told interviewers that the Macron II government would be much more open and voter-friendly.\n\nThere is a whiff of worry in the air.\n\nMacron and his custom-built party, La République En Marche (Republic on the Move), now face parliamentary elections in June. The battle will be uphill.\n\nLingering divisions\n\nAs Teinturier and other analysts underline, the far-right candidates gathered almost one-third of the votes in the first round. Add to that votes for far-left candidates and you have almost 58 per cent of the electorate. The candidates for the traditional centre-right Republicans and centre-left Socialists won, together, less than seven per cent.\n\nAlready the parties on the far left are holding coalition talks and the third-place finisher in the first round, Jean-Luc Mélenchon (who almost squeaked past Le Pen in a last-minute surge), sees himself as the leader of a majority and a prime minister-in-waiting.\n\nJean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the leftist party La France Insoumise (Unbowed France), seen here in 2017, could become prime minister after legislative elections in June. (Reuters / Alain Jocard)\n\nThis has happened twice in recent history. The French call it "cohabitation," and when the opposition has a legislative majority and forms a government, the president finds himself all but politically naked, stripped of most economic powers.\n\nThe good news for Macron is that Le Pen and Zemmour are still fighting on the far right and won\'t form a coalition. The bad news is that his own party is seen as little more than yes men and women.\n\nMore bad news: the election analyst Jérome Fourquet said the election results showed the deep geographical and economic split in the country. In the first round, Le Pen won less than six per cent of the votes in the capital, Paris, while racking up big first-place scores in poorer areas in the north and south.\n\n"The presidential campaign was fleeting and lacked substance," Fourquet said in an interview with the newspaper Le Figaro. "It offered no safety valve or cathartic purge of the tension running through the country. The fear is that all this will move from parliament and spill into the streets."\n\nMacron could be wondering if his luck is about to run out.', 'image': 'https://i.cbc.ca/1.6429515.1650833608!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1240214069.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:10'}

His margin of victory – 58.5 percent to 41.5 percent – was barely more than half of what it had been in 2017.\n\n“Many of our compatriots have voted for me today, not to support the ideas I represent, but to stand in the way of those of the far right,” Macron said at a sombre victory rally at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe president came to power promising a revolution in Europe’s second-largest economy. But after a flurry of action in his first year in office, his reform drive was slowed by protests and brought to a halt by the Covid pandemic. There was more discontent in the country at the end of his term than there had been at the beginning.\n\nFrench bonds barely moved on Monday in response to the result, with the spread between French 10-year debt and its German equivalent tightening by half a basis point to 44.5 basis points.\n\n“This new five-year mandate must not be a continuation of the previous one,” Macron said.\n\nMacron divides opinion. About half the French approve of his handling of the economy during the pandemic and his efforts to help end Russia’s war in Ukraine. His approval rating was at 51 percent in March. But for many French people, he’s seen as arrogant and out of touch.\n\nAttention is already turning to the legislative elections planned for June, when Macron will be defending the parliamentary majority he needs to push through his programme. The results puts the president in a relatively strong position, though he will probably need to form alliances with other parties and Le Pen urged her supporters to continue their campaigning ahead of that vote.\n\n“The result in itself represents a stunning victory,” Le Pen told her supporters, before leading them in a chorus of ‘The Marseillaise,’ the national anthem. “Millions of people voted for the national camp and for change.”\n\nMacron’s challenge will be to heal the rifts in the country and muster support for his plans to make the country more competitive by overhauling social policies such as pensions and improving the country’s economic fundamentals. The Bank of France estimates that the growth potential of the French economy is lower now than it ever was under Macron’s much-derided predecessor François Hollande.\n\n'With everyone'\n\n“We must rebuild with everyone, without leaving anyone on the sidelines, to build a society where people live better, breathe better,” Barbara Pompili, France's environment minister, said in a brief interview at his victory rally. “Still we have a strong far right. And higher abstention. We need to take it into account. We can do that by thinking more about how to better unite citizens.”\n\nThe response to the result was more enthusiastic among France’s European allies. They had been concerned at the prospect of a nationalist with longstanding sympathies for Russia taking power at a time when the European Union is confronting Vladimir Putin over his war with Ukraine.\n\nGerman, Spanish and Portuguese leaders took the unusual step of wading into the domestic affairs of another country by calling on French voters not to support her in a joint column published in several newspapers on April 21. They described her as the candidate “who openly sides with those who attack our freedom and democracy.”\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the first foreign leader to speak to Macron following his victory, said in a Tweet that Macron’s victory showed a strong commitment to Europe. “I am pleased that we will be continuing our good cooperation,” he said, adding that they will meet in person as soon as possible.\n\nThe president’s main focus on Sunday night though was on his domestic concerns. This election campaign has pushed France into unchartered territory, transforming its political landscape into three blocs – Macron in the centre, the far-left led by Jean Luc Mélenchon and the far right, which Le Pen has at times struggled to control.\n\n“The national bloc also needs to unite and mobilise. Our responsibility is huge,” said Eric Zemmour, a nationalist rival to Le Pen who had threatened to overtake her in the first round two weeks ago. “We will fight for ideas in each city and village of France, on the Internet and in the media.”\n\nLast week, Macron struck a humble note on the campaign trail as he reflected on the challenges ahead and said he was ready to negotiate, even on pension reform. That was reflected also in his celebrations. In 2017, he had walked alone across the courtyard at the Louvre museum, this time he was flanked by his wife and dozens of children to a much more subdued version of the European anthem.\n\n“The anger and disagreement must also find a response and that will be my responsibility,” he said. “No-one will be left behind.”\n\nby Ania Nussbaum & Samy Adghirni, Bloomberg", 'image': 'https://fotos.perfil.com/2022/04/25/trim/1140/641/emmanuel-macron-brigitte-macron-1346231.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:27'}

Photo: Jorge Luis Baños / IPS\n\nBy Luis Brizuela (IPS)\n\nHAVANA TIMES – With the retail market in the Cuban capital now being administrated at a municipal level, local governments are looking to facilitate access to food and other products, with shortages and high prices hitting low-income families the hardest, as well as sparking concerns and discontent.\n\nWaiting for dozens of measures geared towards driving agricultural production to pay off, local governments are trying to get greater control over distribution.\n\nThis Caribbean island’s depleted coffers are in no condition to take on additional expenses with prices of raw materials shooting up on the global market.\n\nThe Havana Provincial Government announced that as of Thursday 21st, residents are only be able to buy at stores of the state-monopoly chains Caribe and Cimex in their municipality of the 15 that make up the capital.\n\nSimilar mechanisms have been implemented in some of Cuba’s other 14 provinces, for the sale of regulated and rationed food products by household, which part of the population was asking for.\n\nPensioner Paula Griñán, a resident in the central neighborhood of Vedado, told IPS that she thought it was the right decision, because “it’s the only way I hope I can buy something.”\n\nEsther Cuesta, a primary school teacher living in the Central Havana municipality, agreed, and pointed out in her conversation with IPS that “resellers make it impossible to buy anything, as they collude with employees at these establishments a lot of the time.”\n\nOther Havana residents consulted by IPS said that Havana’s 15 municipalities need to better organize access to scarce products and find alternatives for municipalities with less stores than the densely populated neighborhoods of Central Havana or Vedado.\n\nIn fact, local governments are planning to regulate sales by scanning residents’ ID cards and making a note in their rations booklets.\n\nThis document ensures that every Cuban, regardless of income, has a monthly quota of a small quantity of some products. Although it doesn’t come close to covering all dietary needs, it is relief for low-income households and vulnerable groups. Every little bit helps, people say.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that the stores where these measures will be implemented sell in Cuban pesos and ration sales of food and products classified as “basic essentials and high-impact products”, such as cooking oil, chicken, minced meat, soap, detergent, toothpaste, deodorant, cigarettes, etc.\n\nAgricultural products can be bought freely at so-called agro-markets when and if available, although there are plenty of complaints from consumers about prices there being “abusive”. The only regulated product at these establishments are potatoes, as they are sowed and distributed only by the State.\n\nAnother retail network has a far greater variety of foods and products, but you can only purchase them with magnetic cards and prices in USD, backed by foreign currencies deposited in the bank, a mechanism that only Cubans with relatives and friends living abroad have access to.\n\nCitizens and experts have questioned the USD stores, in force since 2019, saying that it creates market segmentation and inequalities in consumer access.\n\nThe Government has defended that this is a mechanism to bring in foreign currency and to fund purchases at stores selling in Cuban pesos.\n\nRestricting purchases to municipalities of residence was a measure in force during several months in 2020 and 2021, during the worse moments of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the objective of limiting people’s movement in this city of 2.2 million people, in a country of 11.2 million inhabitants.\n\nThe Havana Provincial Government has now underlined that this depends on “availability of products and with the objective of making sales more feasible, reaching greater equity, and as a result, reducing crowds of people at these establishments.”\n\nCuban economist Pedro Monreal posted on his social media that the measure is an expression of “repressed inflation (price controls used to prevent inflation without removing the underlying inflationary pressures) and exhibit an egalitarian approach, not greater equity, as they’ve [the Government] said.”\n\nA salesperson serves a customer inside an independent market selling agricultural produce in the Central Havana municipality. Studies before the restructuring of the food sector indicate that Cuban households spent over 80% of their income on buying food.

Other economists and specialized organizations calculate inflation at over 500%.\n\n“Inflation engulfed the real value of savings in pesos and voided the nominal increase in wages and pensions implemented last year,” Cuban economist and researcher Pavel Vidal told IPS from Cali, Colombia. Vidal works as a professor at the Pontifical Xavierian University in that country.\n\nWith currency reform, the minimum wage was increased to the equivalent of 87 USD (at the official 24:1 exchange rate), and the maximum wage to almost 400. In the case of pensions, the lowest stands at 63 USD, at the official exchange rate.\n\nThe measure fixed the official exchange rate at 24 pesos to 1 USD, but given the fact it’s impossible to buy them from the Central Bank, citizens are turn to the illicit market where the exchange rate ranges from 110-115 pesos to 1 USD, depending on the region.\n\nThe Government has admitted that essential basic goods and services now costs double the 60 USD initially planned for monthly expenses.\n\n“Families with access to remittances, foreign currency or able to invest in private business that benefit from increased prices can find ways to protect themselves against inflation, even if it’s only partially,” Vidal pointed out.\n\nHowever, “the majority of the population with fixed wages and pensions in Cubans pesos have no way to escape the reality of seeing their purchasing power drop every month,” the expert verified.\n\nStudies before currency reform warned that over 80% of income in Cuban households is dedicated to buying food.\n\nThe driver of a tricycle, that works as a bicitaxi and is decorated with Cuban flags, talking to a customer outside a home for sale in a Havana neighborhood. Waiting for dozens of measures geared towards driving agricultural production to pay off in added harvests, local governments are trying to get greater control over distribution.

This is the state of the formal economy in the hands of the Government and military.\n\nVidal believes that in Cuba it’s “vital to continue with pending structural reforms, such as implementing a macroeconomic stabilization policy.”\n\nHe argued that “the longer we have the currency crisis, the harder and more expensive deflation will be, and the greater the damage will be to the economy.”\n\nOther analysts have observed that an ongoing economic slowdown will mean greater deterioration of the general population’s living conditions, as well as increased emigration and social unrest.\n\nRead more from Cuba here on Havana Times', 'image': 'https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/20220419JLB_04-2048x1366-1-800x534-1.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:14'}

It is a common and controversial topic in urban politics and planning. Gentrification often increases the economic value of a neighborhood, but the resulting demographic displacement may itself become a major social issue. Gentrification often shifts a neighborhood’s racial or ethnic composition and average household income by developing new, more expensive housing and businesses in a gentrified architectural style and extending and improving resources that had not been previously accessible.\n\nAccording to Rotamundos.com, a chain of hotels and rental properties, in the United States there are more than 3 million people classified as digital nomads, that is, those who can work from any city or country.\n\nIn addition, as one of the closest destinations for Americans is Mexico, since the pandemic began the influx of those who decided to come to live in Mexico has grown while the Covid health emergency dissipates.\n\nDigital nomads raise rents\n\nJavier Cárdenas Ibarra, Founder and CEO of Rotamundos.com, commented that the phenomenon of digital nomads will cause the vacation rental of houses or apartments to increase by 20% this year.\n\n“They look for properties with certain standards: a good internet connection, a good bed, a cleaning service, and homes that are also sustainable and ecological,” explained Cárdenas Ibarra.\n\nIn addition, if foreigners used to stay only a couple of weeks, now they extend their stay up to six months or more because they have the flexibility to work remotely, he added.\n\nOptions for everyone\n\nIn addition to Mexico City, Tulum, Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Los Cabos, there are other attractive cities for foreigners such as Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlán, Rosarito, Acapulco, San Miguel de Allende, Monterrey and Querétaro.\n\nDavid Padrón, director of Click & Home, a business dedicated to renting houses and apartments for tourists in Tulum, said that the rental of vacation homes in that city, as well as in the entire Riviera Maya, never fell as a result of the pandemic.\n\n“Tourists stopped coming because there were no planes, but as soon as the confinement was lifted, they began to return,” he explained.\n\n“Before they stayed for 14 days, but now they come to work from home for three months. They stay in one, but they don’t like the internet or the laundry, and they go somewhere else for another three months.”\n\nAccording to Click & Home, vacation rentals in Tulum are around 300 dollars per day, so it is expensive, but it includes laundry services, room cleaning, internet, food, and contact with nature.\n\n“Yes, people come and go, not only from the United States, but from Mexico, but right now we are full of people from New York, California, and Texas. A lot of Russians are also arriving,” he commented.\n\nSoftec, the real estate research firm, estimates that this year around 2,700 vacation rental homes will be rented in Tulum.\n\nAnd regarding the construction of real estate to be rented for vacation periods, it is estimated that projects for another 9,000 properties will begin this year throughout the country.\n\nClaudia Velázquez, Director of Operations at Softec, a real estate consultant, said that there are several conditions for 2022 to be an important year for vacation home rentals.\n\n“In Mexico, inflation compared to the United States is lower and people with higher purchasing power can live better here,” the firm said.\n\n“There is also a more professional administration of rental housing, where there are companies that already manage the entire service for you.

Education is a big challenge for children on their migration journey, but opportunities like this give them a chance to catch up on academics and to find emotional support. (AP Photo/Christian Chavez) (Christian Chavez)\n\nCIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico — (AP) — His completed geometry exercise in hand and a smile lighting up his eyes above his face mask, Victor Rodas rushed to the teacher as other students were still drawing.\n\n“I’m winning the race!” the 12-year-old exclaimed. “I’m already done, teacher. I beat everyone.”\n\nBeing enrolled in a school program designed for migrant children in Ciudad Juarez, Victor does have a leg up on many others like him who, fleeing poverty and violence, lose months or even years of schooling on their journeys.\n\nGiving them access to education is a daunting and urgent challenge.\n\nJust in this vast desert metropolis next to El Paso, Texas, thousands of migrant families have hunkered in shelters, waiting to cross into the United States. They\'re prevented from seeking asylum there by U.S. policies that made some wait in Mexico for their court hearings and banned others under a pandemic-era order set to expire May 23.\n\nPastor-run shelters have partnered with educators to help — either busing children to an alternative school that teaches everything from math to reading to dealing with emotions, or bringing in specially accredited teachers.\n\nWhile the curriculum is not religious, faith animates these projects, as it does many other migrant relief efforts at the border. It also informs many of the educators, who recognize schooling as crucial to the youths\' future, including their ability to socialize and eventually find jobs and feel at home wherever they end up.\n\n“They get integrated in the educational system so they can keep gaining confidence,” said Teresa Almada, who runs Casa Kolping, where Victor studies, through a local organization funded three decades ago by lay members of Catholic parishes. “It’s also important … that the families feel they’re not in hostile territory.”\n\nVictor’s oldest sister, Katherine Rodas, 22, fled death threats in Honduras with him and two other siblings she raised after their mother died. While she and her husband are so fearful of gangs that they don’t dare leave their Catholic-run shelter, she leapt at the chance for the children to be bused to Casa Kolping.\n\n“They say the teacher always takes good care of them, plays with them,” Rodas said. “They feel safe there.”\n\nTheir shelter, Casa Oscar Romero, is named for a beloved Salvadoran archbishop, known for ministering to the poor, who was assassinated during his country\'s civil war and later made a saint by Pope Francis. Many housed at this shelter and elsewhere in Ciudad Juarez fled Central America; growing numbers of Mexican families from areas engulfed in cartel warfare are arriving, too.\n\nFor a while after the school program started in October, teachers encouraged parents to join their children in the classrooms to build trust. Among them was Lucia, a single mother of three who fled the Mexican state of Michoacan after a drug cartel “took over the harvest and everything” in their home. She asked to be identified by just her first name for safety.\n\n“Education is important so that they can develop as people and they’ll be able to defend themselves from whatever life will put before them,” Lucia said as she made breakfast in the small communal kitchen at the shelter, where the family had lived for nine months.\n\nHer daughter Carol, 8, already had on her mask and pink backpack, ready to run ahead of the pack as soon as the school bus’s arrival was announced.\n\nAbout three dozen children from Casa Oscar Romero and another religious-run shelter attend Casa Kolping. First to third graders like Carol gather in one classroom, and fourth to sixth graders like Victor meet across the hallway in a large room whose windows frame views of El Paso’s mountains.\n\nAcross the border, Victor imagines, schools will be “big, well-cared for," and will help him reach his goal of becoming an architect. He already practices drawing detailed houses, when he can find paper.\n\n“If you ask the kids, their biggest dream is to cross to the United States,” said teacher Yolanda Garcia.\n\nMany parents see no point in enrolling children in school in Mexico, where they don\'t plan to stay. Also, many public educators are reluctant to admit migrant students, for fear of losing teacher slots if class sizes shrink when they leave suddenly, said Dora Espinoza, a primary school principal in Ciudad Juarez. She actively reaches out to families, including at a shelter two blocks from her classrooms.\n\n“Why all that paperwork if the kid is going to be gone in two weeks” is one argument that makes promoting child migrant education such a challenge, said Paola Gómez, Mexico’s education officer for UNICEF. The U.N. child protection agency helps finance Casa Kolping as a pilot program, where attendance gets a kid transferable credit for both Mexican and U.S. schools.\n\nIn addition to uncertainty, poverty and discrimination keep nearly half of refugee children from school worldwide, according to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nBut the biggest barrier is insecurity. Hounded by violence in their hometowns and preyed upon by gangs along the journey — often right up to a shelter’s doors — many parents are afraid to let children out of their sight.\n\nThe faith-run programs address that by providing secure transportation, as in the case of Casa Kolping, or bringing instructors directly to the migrants, as in the case of another Ciudad Juarez shelter, Buen Samaritano, Spanish for good Samaritan.\n\nStill, the children take serious traumas with them to the classroom.\n\n“‘Teacher, I’m here because they murdered my parents.’ They tell it in detail, children don’t cover anything up,” said Samuel Jimenéz, a teacher at Buen Samaritano on a recent blustery afternoon. "In the moment they’re here, we can take them out of that reality. They forget it.”\n\nLed by a Methodist pastor and his wife, Buen Samaritano housed more than 70 migrants that day, half of them minors. Children swept swirling desert dust out of the temple area, where the altar was curtained off to create the classroom.\n\nTen-year-old Aritzi Ciriaco, a fourth grader from Michoacan who had been at Buen Samaritano since August with her parents and grandparents, couldn’t wait to get started on the day’s Spanish exercises. She worried that learning English and navigating U.S. schools would be hard once they cross the border.\n\n“The teachers were telling me that there you can’t miss a single class,” Aritzi said “Still, it’s good to know other countries.”\n\nOther challenges for the instructors include catching up students who arrive unable to read or write.\n\n“We are faced with all kinds of falling behind,” said Garcia at Casa Kolping. “But most of all, with a lot of desire to learn. They missed school. When you give them their notebooks, the emotion on their face … some even tell you, ‘How lovely it feels to learn.’”\n\nOne chilly spring morning, one of her students, Juan Pacheco, 12, struggled with a punctuation exercise taught in Spanish — his first language is Mixtec, one of the many Indigenous tongues in Mexico and Central America.\n\nHe had spent more than eight months at Casa Oscar Romero after his family fled the Mexican state of Guerrero, where cartel fighting made it too dangerous to farm even their meager plot of beans.\n\nBut with some coaching, Juan successfully completed another task faster than his classmates: drawing a banknote, a cooking pot, a radish and an ear of corn, and explaining which one didn’t fit with the others.\n\n“I don’t like to talk much, but yes, I’m a good student,” Juan said, beaming.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

But with Brazil\'s presidential election less than six months away, many samba schools chose to include political themes such as racism and inequality in their performances.\n\nMr Bolsonaro made light of the performance on Twitter, describing it as "bad".\n\nHe said that all Covid vaccines administered in Brazil were purchased by the federal government and that the decision to receive the vaccine had always been up to the public.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the main parades on Sunday morning, judges will decide on the top schools in São Paulo and Rio De Janeiro on Tuesday and the celebrations will conclude with a final presentation by the chosen schools on Friday.', 'image': 'https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/femiE9h41MU30.c31WiBSQ--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/3ea8e339aadc2a565c90c48567bd2917', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:29'}

I come to tell you that it is God’s will and mine that you tell those of this town and its surroundings, that in this ravine made by two hills and it’s the one that’s in front of this place, they will find a miraculous spring of water for all diseases, which is under a very large rock. Do not doubt what I tell you, nor not do what I command you.”\n\nHowever, Diego doubted the apparition and, fearing that people wouldn’t believe him, decided not to do what the archangel told him.\n\nThe official Facebook page of the Shrine of Saint Michael the Archangel states that “in punishment for his disobedience, a deadly fever in his entrails came upon the young man.”\n\nThe archangel appeared to Diego again the night of May 7-8, healing him and taking him to the place where the shrine would be erected. The archangel appeared once more, on Nov. 13.\n\nThe young man collected water from the spring and took it to the local bishop, who in turn, as part of his investigation of the apparition, distributed it among some sick people.

Unlike the Freshii workers that wrap burritos and mop floors, these “virtual” workers are nowhere near the store. Instead, at least some of them process orders from a Nicaraguan call centre nearly 6,000 km away, where they earn much less than Ontario’s minimum wage.\n\nThe program is only in the early stages of testing, but Freshii’s virtual cashiers are part of a wave of outsourcing and automated technology that is slowly changing Canada’s retail industry.\n\nFor many Ontario retail workers, the implications of these innovations raise a daunting question: how secure is my job?\n\nFreshii, a franchise with 343 restaurants across North America, declined to provide details to the Star about its virtual cashier technology, but in a statement, Freshii’s chief business development officer Paul Hughes said Percy is operated by a third-party company.\n\n“Just like with Uber Eats, Skip the Dishes, self-checkout options and other emerging ordering/cashier technologies, Freshii is always looking to be an early tester and adopter of new tech solutions that might make it easier for our customers to order healthy meals and our franchise partners to run more successful restaurants,” Hughes said.\n\nThe company has not previously spoken publicly about the program, other than to mention several “labour optimization programs in development” that it hopes will “further assist partners in managing costs and protecting profitability,” in a recent corporate filing.\n\nBut employees at the company’s franchise locations told the Star they’ve been aware of the program since November. The Star verified three locations in Ontario that use these virtual cashiers — two in Toronto and one in Waterloo. One of the locations, in Toronto’s Rosedale neighbourhood, has been using a Percy cashier since January.\n\nTwo virtual cashiers who spoke with the Star said they are located in Nicaragua, where they work at a call centre that pays them $3.75 (U.S.) an hour.\n\nIn North America, Freshii typically hires for server positions that pay between $12 to $16 an hour, according to data collected by Glassdoor, an American jobs search website. In Ontario, where the minimum wage is $15 (Canadian), Freshii’s virtual cashier program could potentially save the company $10 or more an hour.\n\nThe practice is entirely legal, multiple employment lawyers told the Star.\n\n“It’s just like any other kind of outsourcing: if you’re sending jobs to people in a different country, you’re only obligated to comply with the labour standards of that country,” said Jonathan Pinkus, an employment lawyer and partner at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP. “Being virtually present in Ontario doesn’t change that.”\n\nOntario’s Employment Standards Act is applied to workers who are either working in Ontario or performing work outside Ontario that is deemed a “continuation” of work performed in Ontario.\n\nFreshii is likely relying on the argument that their cashiers’ work is not a continuation of work performed in Ontario, but rather another task that call centre workers can complete in another jurisdiction, said Michael Wright, a lawyer and founding partner at Wright Henry LLP.\n\nStill, the program drew outrage from labour organizers who see the practice as a way to circumvent Ontario’s minimum wage laws.\n\n“Shipping jobs to an offshore location to pay less than a third of our minimum wage here is just extremely disappointing, and, quite frankly, I’m disgusted a company like Freshii would take this approach,” said Bea Bruske, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.\n\n“We need jobs that pay taxes in Canada and that help boost our economic activity.”\n\nAn increase in outsourcing and automation may prove to be one of the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic legacies. From factories to fast-food chains, businesses turned to technology to keep operations afloat amidst physical distancing measures and tight labour markets.\n\nSome of those changes have sparked curious innovations. Sobeys introduced “smart carts”: shopping carts that scan shoppers’ items, track total bills, accept payment and let them skip the checkout line. Late last year, Dark Horse Espresso opened a chain of “robo-cafes” around Toronto — autonomous, contactless machines that occupy street-facing retail space and spit out lattes.\n\nResearch on Canadian automation contains mixed findings. A report released on Monday by the Centre for Future Work titled “Where Are The Robots?” argued that Canadian businesses have been slow to invest in automation over the past two decades, reducing the impact of robots and automated technology on the labour force.\n\nThe report finds that business investment innovation as a share of GDP has declined dramatically over the past 20 years, from 2.3 per cent in 2001 to 1.8 per cent in 2021.\n\nSector-specific research, meanwhile, has detected a drop in jobs in grocery stores and food retail. A recent report from the Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Ryerson University found a 15 per cent drop in full-time positions at grocery stores between 2006 and 2016 — mostly from customer-facing roles.\n\nMore broadly, a report published by the International Monetary Fund last year predicted that pandemic-era automation would increase global inequality in the coming years.\n\nSome companies have relied on outsourcing, rather than automation, to reduce labour costs. The wage differences between Canada and some countries in the southern nations are stark, making offshoring a difficult prospect to resist.\n\nWhile a call centre worker in Ontario earns a minimum $15 an hour, a worker in India earns on average $0.35 (Canadian) an hour, a worker in the Philippines earns $1.65 an hour and a worker in Bangladesh earns $0.11 an hour.\n\n“Employees were forced to work remotely during the pandemic, whether they liked it or not, and companies have realized it’s easier than ever now to send that work overseas,” said Bruske.\n\nIn a statement, Ontario Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development Monte McNaughton called the virtual cashier program “outrageous.”\n\n“This ... moves entirely in the wrong direction. I expect better from a Toronto-based company and know customers will vote with their feet,” he said.”\n\nSHARE:', 'image': 'https://images.thestar.com/AM4ksvpy7pzCtLEQ261fo1zQpSo=/1086x1448/smart/filters:cb(1651009981517)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/business/2022/04/26/meet-the-freshii-virtual-cashier-who-works-from-nicaragua-for-375-an-hour/percy_digitized.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:14:24'}

The 3ᵉ round, on June 12 and 19, promises to be boiling hot.\n\nOn the evening of the first round, April 10, we wrote that France resembled a still smoldering battlefield, with its dead and wounded, its routed armies and the new strategies developed by military leaders to fight new battles.\n\nIn the aftermath of the second round, which gave a clear victory to Emmanuel Macron (58.54% of the votes cast against 41.46% for Marine Le Pen), the presidential camp has a modest victory. And rightly so. For everyone knows that it is a victory in trompe-l’oeil: it gives the illusion of reality.\n\nIncumbent president already rejected\n\nLet’s look at the figures. Emmanuel Macron obtained 18,779,641 votes on April 24, 2022, i.e. 58.54% of the votes cast, putting him well ahead of the election. But this flattering score falls to 38.52% of the electorate, i.e. the registered voters. In other words, nearly two thirds of the French did not vote Macron. Worse: between 2017 and 2022, Macron lost 1,963,487 votes! This is not the triumph that we would like to believe.\n\nAt the same time, Marine Le Pen totals 13,297,760 votes (27.28% of registered voters) and gains 2,659,285 votes in five years !\n\n63% of the French for a cohabitation\n\nThese figures attest to the rejection of the re-elected president and his policies during his five-year term. It is so true that an OpinionWay poll for Cnews reveals “that one person in three who voted Macron in the second round wants him not to have a majority in the National Assembly.” And 63% of the French registered voters want a cohabitation with the appointment of a Prime Minister from an opposition party.\n\nIn other words, many voters voted for Macron to block Marine Le Pen, but they do not want Macron to govern. Here is France divided, fractured, more divided than ever.\n\nCut up like a puzzle\n\nGone is the France cut in two of our youth, with a permanent confrontation between left and right who governed in turn according to the principle of the pendulum. Here is France cut into small pieces, like a puzzle. If it is true that the first round revealed the tri-polarization of French political life, the second round shows us a France of the elites against a France of the people, a France of the big cities against a France of the rural areas, a France of the “bobos”, happy and rich, and a France of the eternally forgotten, of the poor (there are 10 million of them) who can neither find decent housing, nor heat, nor food, nor entertainment.\n\nIn these conditions, how can one be the president “of all the French”? Macron’s France will become a country regularly shaken by political and social convulsions, like the Gilets jaunes. The legislative elections of June 12 and 19 will give us a glimpse of the turmoil that will shake the country under the Macron presidency.', 'image': 'https://frenchdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Macron1-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:25'}

Berlin has not only hit the brakes when it comes to EU sanctions, but its refusal to supply heavy weapons to Ukraine has also reduced its leadership potential.\n\n“I think Germany has to be content now with playing at best the second, maybe even the third role in Europe. And that, of course, is partly due to the dithering and hesitation of Chancellor Olaf Scholz,” Vöpel said.\n\nAt the same time, the war has also exposed the weaknesses of its policies of the last few decades that concern Russia.\n\nWhile France always warned against too much economic dependence on Russia – especially concerning the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – Germany’s Russia policy was driven by the attempt to bring Russia closer to the West through closer economic integration. This approach has largely failed, considering Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Germany is also much more isolated than France in other areas. Macron, for example, has sought a close alliance with his Italian counterpart, Mario Draghi, on reforming European debt rules.\n\n“Particularly in the face of the current crises, Macron will try to work with Draghi to push for increased financial leeway to be able to shoulder the necessary investments,” emphasised Vöpel.\n\nAlthough Germany, in particular, has been hesitant to support the reform and the loosening of the EU’s fiscal rules, the balance of power in Europe has shifted toward the reform of rules, he added.\n\nGerman position in the EU\n\nHowever, Germany’s positions now coincide with Macron’s visions in many areas, most notably the attempt to foster European sovereignty.\n\nWhile Macron’s calls for a sovereign Europe in his keynote speech at the Sorbonne in 2017 were mainly left unanswered by the German government, the issue is now also topping the agenda in Germany. Scholz’s Zeitenwende is already profoundly anchored in German discourse and goes beyond the Ukraine war’s immediate effects.\n\nLast Wednesday, for example, Finance Minister Christian Lindner called for a complete strategic reset of German policy.\n\n“We have placed ourselves at a triple risk. We have become too dependent when it comes to energy from Russia, security from the U.S. and business with China,” Lindner told Focus Online. As a result, he said, Germany must now “re-found its business model.”\n\nGerman SPD MEP Udo Bullmann also stressed to EURACTIV that it was now necessary to strengthen European sovereignty.\n\nWhat is needed now is “a European policy full of self-confidence, but also full of clear objectives of peacekeeping, the international role of the European Union, and a new economic and development model in the face of climate change,” Bullmann said.\n\nMeanwhile, CEP Paris Director Marc Uzan also expressed confidence in the German ability to change.\n\n“Germany is at a turning point, and I think Berlin will be up to the challenge,” he told EURACTIV.\n\nAccording to him, France could also play a key role for Germany in this political upheaval.\n\n“Marcon could be the bridge to help Germany change its growth model and maybe its geopolitical model too,” Uzan stressed.\n\n[Edited by Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57538786-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But she warned that Macron\'s next term was likely to show as "much contempt and brutality" for the ordinary French voter as his previous term.\n\nHinting at her political future, the 53-year-old far-right politician said: "I\'m going to continue to work for France and French citizens with the dedication that you know that I am capable of," Le Pen said.\n\nDW Correspondent Barbara Wesel, reporting from Le Pen\'s campaign headquarters in Paris, said: "There is no natural successor, it really is a one-woman show.

France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nTalking to reporters on April 25, Johnson said it is “very important” to have a French president “who can be relied upon” on international issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s not right for friendly governments to comment on elections in neighbouring countries but what I can certainly say is that it is very, very important that Emmanuel and I have been able to work closely together on Ukraine over the last few weeks and months,” he said.\n\n“We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of NATO, has been absolutely vital for the stance we’ve taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I’m very, very reassured by that.”\n\nFrench President and La Republique en Marche party candidate for reelection Emmanuel Macron celebrates after his victory in France’s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

The French government has complained about the UK’s reluctance to issue fishing licences to French fishermen, claiming it was a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly expressed frustration over France’s alleged failure to prevent illegal immigrants from boarding small boats and crossing the English Channel into Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson, who led the Brexit campaign and took the UK out of the EU, has more common ground with Le Pen than Macron on the issue of EU membership.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, though she insisted during the election campaign she had no “secret agenda” this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nMarine Le Pen, presidential candidate, delivers her concession speech after early result projections show France’s incumbent President Emmanuel Macron heading to win a second five-year term as president, in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2.

Police used tear gas to disperse gatherings in Paris and the western city of Rennes.\n\n- New era -\n\nIn a victory speech on the Champ de Mars in central Paris at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, Macron vowed to respond to the anger of voters who backed his far-right rival, saying his new term would not continue unchanged from the last five years.\n\n"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right," he told thousands of cheering supporters.\n\n"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me."\n\nHe also pledged a "renewed method" to govern France, adding that this "new era" would not be one of "continuity with the last term which is now ending".\n\nIn a combative speech to supporters in Paris in which she accepted the result but showed no sign of quitting politics, Le Pen, 53, said she would "never abandon" the French and was already preparing for the June legislative elections.\n\n"The result represents a brilliant victory," she said to cheers.\n\n"This evening, we launched the great battle for the legislative elections," Le Pen said, adding that she felt "hope" and calling on opponents of the president to join with her National Rally (RN) party.\n\n- \'Count on France\' -\n\nThe result is narrower than the second-round clash in 2017, when the same two candidates met in the run-off and Macron polled over 66 percent of the vote.\n\nFor Le Pen, her third defeat in presidential polls will be a bitter pill to swallow after she plowed years of effort into making herself electable and distancing her party from the legacy of its founder, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nCritics insisted her party never stopped being extreme-right and racist while Macron repeatedly pointed to her plan to ban the wearing of the Muslim headscarf in public if elected.\n\nThe projections caused immense relief in Europe after fears a Le Pen presidency would leave the continent rudderless following Brexit and the departure from politics of German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news for all of Europe" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nEU president Charles Michel said the bloc could now "count on France for five more years" while Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also congratulated him, saying she was "delighted to be able to continue our excellent cooperation".\n\nIn another election Sunday, Slovenia\'s three-time Prime Minister Janez Jansa, criticized by opponents as an authoritarian right-wing populist, was at risk of losing power to a party led by political newcomer Robert Golob.\n\n- \'Ocean of abstention\' -\n\nMacron will be hoping for a less complicated second term that will allow him to implement his vision of more pro-business reform and tighter EU integration, after a first term shadowed by protests, then the pandemic and finally Russia\'s military operation in Ukraine.\n\nBut he will have to win over those who backed his opponents and the millions of French who did not bother to vote.\n\nPolling organizations estimated turnout of just 72 percent, the lowest in any presidential election second-round run-off since 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, according to partial results, 6.45 percent of voters in the election voted for neither candidate in blank ballots while 2.35 percent spoilt their papers.\n\nThe hard-left third-placed candidate in the first round, Jean-Luc Melenchon, had refused to endorse Macron.\n\nHe has his eyes firmly set on the June elections.\n\nMelenchon welcomed Le Pen\'s defeat as "very good news for the unity of our people" but said Le Pen and Macron had barely managed to win a third of support from registered voters.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots", he said.', 'image': 'https://cdnimgen.royanews.tv/imageserv/Size728Q40/news/20220425/35368.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:44'}

And so do U.S. voters in general, not just Republicans. Nearly 60 percent of those who participated in a recent Gallup poll said there was too much immigration into the country. That makes anti-immigrant sentiment mainstream. Le Pen\'s platform also proposed that non-citizen immigrants arrested for any crime be sent back to their country of origin. This fringe position in France is the law of the land in America and has been for years.\n\n"They\'re bringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime. They\'re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," Donald Trump said on the day in 2015 that he announced he was running for president. During his tenure in office, Trump took many different steps to limit immigration, and not just the illegal sort. In fact, in 2020, he reduced the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. by 49 percent.\n\nWhat puts Le Pen and the National Rally Party in the far-right corner of politics, then? Like her near-fascist father before her, Le Pen isn\'t fond of immigrants, and I mean really not fond . She wants them to assimilate to French culture to the point where they would be indistinguishable from France\'s original immigrants (or rather, invaders), the Germanic Franks, who came for a visit to the Roman Empire in the 4th century and never went away. But even more than assimilating, Le Pen and her party would much rather immigrants just go back to where they came from.\n\nAnalysts all over the world woke up on Monday morning to mourn the fact that far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen wasn\'t beaten soundly enough, even though she lost by more than 16 points to a man few people in France apparently love , the incumbent Emmanuel Macron.\n\nNational Rally is also famously skeptical of international alliances, especially those with NATO and the European Union. France is one of the founding members of the EU, and along with Germany, forms its heart. For France to leave the Union would gut it, and possibly bring an end to the "European project" of peace and economic cooperation for the continent. But such actions don\'t send a shudder down the spine of Americans; Trump for his part killed a major trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, threatened to undo America\'s free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, pulled out of the Paris climate treaty, and came closer than we ever knew to essentially pulling the U.S. out of NATO — all to the applause of many Republicans.\n\nTrump was not standing out in the cold on the issue of NATO, either. Before the war in Ukraine, only 48 percent of Americans thought the organization was doing a good job, and a full 65 percent of Republicans thought it was doing a poor job. If France is the heart of the EU, the U.S. simply is NATO. The U.S. founded the alliance and provides a shield for the other members that fall under the American aegis. This may change, thanks Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s war in Ukraine, which has forced Europe to rethink its role in its own defense, but as of right now, U.S. leadership is clear and unquestioned.\n\nAnd speaking of the war in Ukraine and Russia in general, Le Pen and Trump share something else: A love for Putin. Over and over, Trump praised Putin for his intelligence, strength, and the high quality of his negotiating tactics. He even asked for Russia to help him get dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, which is widely believed to have been tainted by Russian interference, both online and off. Le Pen is also deeply tied to Putin, speaking warmly of the autocrat while her National Rally happily took Russian money. She has praised Putin\'s nationalism and skepticism of globalization.\n\nLe Pen\'s economic policies are not a one-to-one correlation with those in the GOP — this is France after all, so some "socialism" on health care and other issues are required — but the fear of corporate globalism is exactly the same. Trump\'s "America First" economics fit very well with Le Pen\'s ideas.\n\nOn social issues, National Rally had to moderate several positions to become competitive in France. Gay marriage and abortion play their part in the political process over there, just as they do here, and Le Pen had to loosen up. The difference here is that America\'s far-right is succeeding in protecting the "traditional values" of the Dark Ages.\n\nSo could Le Pen be elected in America? No, she\'s a foreigner. But as far as her positions go, there\'s very little to bar a politician like her. We\'ve already voted for people on the local and national levels who make Le Pen practically look like a liberal. Even her position that Muslims should not be allowed to wear headscarves in public places, while extreme, falls in line with overall American feelings about Muslims.\n\nEven now, as President Biden is being praised elsewhere in the world for rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and reaffirming America\'s commitment to NATO, there are viable presidential candidates waiting in the wings to undo that work. And even if they don\'t win in 2024, chances are they\'ll be a lot closer to the White House than 16 points behind.', 'image': 'https://mediacloud.theweek.com/image/upload/s--X-WVjvBW--/f_auto,t_content-image-full-desktop@1/v1650910407/Trump le pen.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

These are set to alter further the balance of power between the Socialists and the Republicains who have already imploded and are struggling to survive.\n\nInstead, the main opponents of Macron’s liberal, centrist La République En Marche are Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s far-left La France Insoumise and Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement national.\n\nWhat are the possible scenarios?\n\nAn “unlikely” far-right or far-left majority\n\nAccording to Thanassis Diamantopoulos, professor of political science at the University of Athens and expert on the French regime, the hypothesis of a far-right or far-left majority in the National Assembly is “unlikely”, despite the historically high scores of Le Pen and Mélenchon’s parties.\n\nIn France, the two-round majoritarian single-member electoral system means that “even with a majority, the far right and far left cannot win parliamentary elections. […] They have no potential to form an alliance”, and it is easier for “the forces around the centre to form an alliance”, Diamantopoulos told EURACTIV France.\n\nBut in recent days, Mélenchon has unequivocally called on his supporters: “I ask you to elect me Prime minister”.\n\nBetween the fact that “there will be no defections” in favour of Mélenchon’s party and the “under-representation of the extremes”, the possibility that his appeal will become a reality in the ballot box remains dim.\n\nAnother element that works against the most radical parties is that “there are two ‘anti-system’ expressions, one on the far right and the other on the left”.\n\nFor these reasons, eight deputies were elected under the banner of the Rassemblement National in 2017, despite qualifying for the second round of the presidential election, and Mélenchon’s party had seventeen. These results are far below the overall results at the national level.\n\nThe (new) attempt to unite the left\n\nOn the left, the urgent need for unity is being felt both by executives and voters, in order to regain influence and hope to impose a social and ecological majority on Macron.\n\nContacted by EURACTIV France, Sylvie Guillaume, a Socialist MEP, said she hoped that “the legislative elections [will make it possible to] restore a better balance because the presidential election is not a blank check” for the newly re-elected president.\n\nThe same is true of the Insoumis — Mélenchon’s supporters — who want to believe in uniting the left.\n\nMEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV France that her movement “appeals to those who do not feel represented” and admits to being in discussion with the other left-wing forces, to agree on “a common base”.\n\nThe call of Mélenchon and his supporters seem to have been heard by the other left-wing movements. Europe Ecologie Les Verts MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV France that “the political forces of the left and the ecologists must organise themselves to weigh together if they do not want to condemn themselves to lose separately”.\n\nLéon Deffontaines, president of the young communists’ movement, told EURACTIV France he hoped to see “the ideas of equality, sharing and solidarity become the majority again”.\n\nCommunist candidate Fabien Roussel pleaded on Sunday evening for a “global agreement” of the left, demanding that “local anchors and different sensibilities on the left be taken into account” in order to avoid the distribution benefiting only La France Insoumise, which largely dominated the left in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nYet, according to Diamantopoulos, even if “some constituencies [the left] could get some MPs elected” the idea of “getting close to a parliamentary majority is a political fiction”.\n\nWhat majority for Macron?\n\nDespite the parliamentary challenges, Macron will not throw in the towel.\n\nJudging by the comments of Gabriel Attal, spokesman for the outgoing government, confidence in Macron’s camp remains high.\n\n“I am convinced that the French will give the president of the republic the means to act to protect them, with a majority [in the National Assembly],” Attal told BFMTV-RMC on Monday morning.\n\nHaving limited manoeuvring room due to a lack of partisan alliances beyond the existing majority, Macron’s camp will try to convince voters of other political inclinations or, at best, conclude circumstantial agreements in the territories where this is possible.\n\nDiamantopoulos believes Macron could build a “presidential majority that would start with the former Gaullists (centre-right Républicains) and reach the hinge of the left, including perhaps even a part of the Socialist Party and, of course, the ecologists”.\n\nMacron must therefore, according to Diamantopoulos, “wink at the ecologists” the day after the election. His promise to appoint a prime minister “in charge of ecological planning” would be a step in this direction.\n\nBut the question is: when will this appointment take place? Diamantopoulos warned that this plan could be changed, depending on the results of the legislative elections, which will tilt the future government more to the right or the left, and thus define Macron’s alliance choices.\n\nAs a reminder, in 2017 he chose Edouard Philippe from the centre-right as prime minister, even though he was not forced to do so, having acquired a solid majority in the Assembly, as well as several other ministers from the right.\n\nAt the same time, Macron will also have to devote some of his energy to the French EU presidency.\n\n“He needs to ensure the ongoing French EU presidency is a success. It ends on June 30 and there is an upcoming conference on the Western Balkans to be organised soon, which provides an opportunity to start rethinking the EU’s enlargement policy,” Tara Varma of the European Council on Foreign Relations told EURACTIV in emailed comments.\n\n“Macron will have to take the mantle of European diplomatic leadership again. He mentioned Ukraine in his victory speech. He should travel to Kyiv immediately with (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz to demonstrate Europe’s support for Ukraine,” she said.\n\nBig relief after Macron's re-election but 'third round' ahead French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to unite a deeply divided nation after winning re-election on Sunday (24 April) in a battle against rival Marine Le Pen that saw the far right come its closest yet to taking power.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]", 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57636418-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television.

On Sunday, the sitting French president defeated Le Pen with 58.5 percent of the vote — provoking a sigh of relief from many environmental activists, despite their quarrels with Macron during his previous 5-year term.\n\nLe Pen’s energy plan had called for exiting the European Union’s electricity market, accelerating the development of nuclear power, and establishing a moratorium on wind and solar development. (Nuclear currently provides about 70 percent of the country’s electricity; wind and solar combined provide only about 10 percent.) “Wind turbines are ugly and they ruin our landscapes,” Le Pen said in the April 20 debate. The far-right candidate had also vowed to cut the value-added tax on gas, electricity, and oil from 20 percent to 5.5 percent — a move that would have cost the government up to 12 billion euros (nearly $12.9 billion) and boosted demand for fossil fuels.\n\nGrist relies on the support of generous readers like you to keep our climate news free.

Here's How\n\nThe president’s climate policies could also spill over into neighboring European countries. France is currently the leader of the European Union Council, which is tasked with implementing Europe’s “Green Deal” — a massive spending package designed to help the continent get off fossil fuels. And Macron has been one of the most outspoken critics of using Russian coal and oil in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, calling for an outright blockade on the import of those fuels into the E.U. “The results of elections in France always reverberate way beyond the country’s borders,” Lucie Mattera, head of European politics at the think tank E3G, told E&E News last week. “And 2022 is no exception.”\n\nBut critics have argued that the president struggled to implement his climate agenda during his first term. After promising to cut emissions in his first presidential election, in 2017, Macron instituted increases in France’s fuel tax, with the aim of reducing emissions from the transportation sector. The resulting price hike sparked the gilet jaunes, or “yellow vests” movement, with hundreds of thousands of French citizens protesting in the streets.\n\nChagrined, Macron repealed the tax increases and launched a program of public participation in government — including a Citizens’ Convention on Climate, a randomly selected group of 150 voters tasked with helping the country create new climate policy. The president promised to pass their proposals on to the legislature or to a referendum “without filter” — but there, too, he ran into conflict. After the convention released its 149 proposals, Macron preemptively vetoed three of them, including a tax on corporate profits to fund clean energy. Only a few dozen of the citizens’ suggestions ended up in France’s sweeping 2021 climate law, and those often in watered-down form.\n\nIn the short term, the reelected president has promised to create a new prime minister position focused on “ecological planning” and increase investments in renewable technologies. Part of that may be an act of political expediency: Macron was shifted left during the campaign by the popular primary run of the leftist candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who attracted many young voters with his calls for a 200 billion euro ($214 billion) investment in green infrastructure and a constitutional amendment to protect biodiversity. The support for Mélenchon, Macron said in a speech last week, had sent a “powerful message.”", 'image': 'https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron_election_presidential_climate.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France.

He is the teenager who fell in love with a 39-year-old teacher and was loved back in return, the Rothschild banker, the man who betrayed former president François Hollande, the pianist, the technocrat, the lover of poetry and theater, and the seducer. This is the portrait of Emmanuel Macron, 44, in four acts:\n\nThe man\n\nEmmanuel Macron was born in Amiens on December 21, 1977, the son of Jean-Michel, a doctor and professor of neurology, and Françoise, a general practitioner. He was the oldest of three brothers.\n\nThe man and the character were born 15 years later, towards the end of 1992, when the schoolboy fell in love with Brigitte Auzière, born Brigitte Trogneux, his French and drama teacher. The love was reciprocated. The teacher was 39 years old, married to a well-known local banker, and one of her daughters was Emmanuel’s classmate.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the impact of such an unconventional (and currently criminal) relationship in a relatively small, provincial city like Amiens, with a population of around 130,000. Brigitte’s family owned the most famous bakery in town. Emmanuel’s parents were doctors. They all knew each other. The Macrons tried to end the matter by sending their son to Paris. It was useless: Brigitte separated and visited Emmanuel on weekends. For her, Emmanuel was “a Mozart,” a boy who dazzled her with his intelligence and maturity. For him, Brigitte meant and still means everything.\n\nStill a minor, Emmanuel Macron broke with his family and with his hometown. He and Brigitte took on the world. It remains an indestructible union. The current president of France does not have great friends or confidants: Brigitte is enough for him. Without Brigitte, Macron cannot be understood.\n\nSeveral people who know Macron (as far as it is possible to know someone who is essentially hermetic) agree that he is a man who lives out his life as a fictional character, in search of increasingly sensational challenges and adventures. That craving is likely related to the taboo that was broken in 1992.\n\n“I think he would have liked to be a writer or an actor, and he applies his dramatic talent to politics as well as to his own life,” says Gaspard Gantzer, who was his classmate at the National School of Administration and then at the Elysée Palace: Macron was an adviser to president François Hollande, Gantzer was the press officer.\n\nMacron is a seducer capable of charming almost anyone. He sleeps very little, his memory is extraordinary and his capacity for work almost unlimited. “We are talking about a very, very brilliant man,” says Manuel Valls, France’s prime minister when Macron was economy minister.\n\n“He knows how to be cold when it suits him and he maintains his cool at all times, but he tends to take a positive approach to things and is capable of being very thoughtful and caring,” says Gantzer. All the people consulted agree in underlining two virtues of Macron: physical courage, which has more than once made him face hostile crowds (and get out of it thanks to his charm), and audacity. He was a good corporate banker at Rothschild. In that job, he learned to take risks and jump at any opportunity.\n\n"Where others see charm and friendliness, I have failed to see anything other than superficiality and narcissism," says a conservative politician who prefers not to be quoted.\n\nThe traitor\n\nEmmanuel Macron is haunted by the shadow of Eugène de Rastignac, the most famous social climber in French literature. Rastignac appears in several novels by Honoré de Balzac: he is a hustler who prospers in finances thanks to his lover’s husband; he marries his lover’s daughter and achieves a good position in Parisian society. “All politicians have something of Rastignac,” concedes Manuel Valls. “And the French system favors personality-driven ventures.”\n\nMacron, during his campaign trip to Marseille, on April 16. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nValls, who after serving as French prime minister later became a city councilor in Barcelona (he is a dual Spanish-French citizen), was one of the victims of the great conspiracy developed by Macron from inside the Élysée. He had fierce clashes with his economy minister and went to great lengths to convince then-president François Hollande to remove Macron from the palace. It was useless: Hollande fell under Macron’s spell until “the methodical betrayal” of his protégé, in Hollande’s own words, became evident. It was already too late.\n\nLe traître et le néant (or The traitor and the void), the book on Emmanuel Macron written by journalists Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme, confirms over and over again that Emmanuel Macron’s ability to fascinate is multiplied with older men and greater power. As soon as he left the National School of Administration, Macron successfully sought the protection of the most powerful men of the Republic: Jacques Attali and Alain Minc, two president-makers. It was Minc who procured him a job at the Rothschild Bank, so that he could amass wealth before devoting himself to politics. And it was Attali who brought him close to the Socialist Party and François Hollande.\n\nDuring Hollande’s presidency, first as an adviser and then as a minister, Emmanuel Macron played his own game. Luck helped him, as always: the strokes of fortune of the current president of France are legendary. When he was about to leave the Élysée for a well-paid teaching position, for example, a stroke of luck led him to the Ministry of Economy. In addition to luck, boldness and an amazing ability to deceive also played a role.\n\nMacron used all the resources of the ministry to weave a dense network of contacts. During his last eight months in office, Macron spent €120,000 on dinners held at the ministerial residence, an imposing glass-enclosed apartment facing the Seine. Some nights there were two dinner shifts with different diners. And a third shift was added at La Rotonde, the Macrons’ favorite brasserie.\n\nMacron was creating En Marche! (the name was chosen by Brigitte because she liked it and the initials coincided with those of her husband) and he repeatedly assured Hollande that it was a political club intended to support his re-election. Instead, together with a group of moderate socialists who felt orphaned by the fall of long-time party heavyweight Dominique Strauss-Kahn (the fall from grace of DSK after being accused of rape was one of Macron’s lucky breaks), Macron was in fact boycotting Hollande and actually preparing his own race for the presidency. The documents were burned in a stove. There was absolute secrecy.\n\nMacron destroyed the options of Hollande and Valls from within. Finally, he announced that he was not a socialist, forced his own dismissal and embarked on the campaign to become president of France.\n\nThe politician\n\nLike a corporate banker, Emmanuel Macron launched a takeover bid (after long secret preparations) for the Socialist Party. The initial core of En Marche! was made up of socialists disappointed by François Hollande, the president who wanted to be “normal” and ended up being irrelevant. Once the main party on the left had been dismantled, he captured very prominent figures from The Republicans, the great Gaullist party on the right. “He was the first to guess that the classic parties had collapsed, that the system was in a state of crisis,” says Manuel Valls.\n\nPerhaps Macron’s first presidential adventure would have failed if Alain Juppé had won the primaries of The Republicans. But François Fillon prevailed, a candidate whose campaign frayed when it was discovered that his wife received a salary without working and that he was irregularly financing his high lifestyle. Another stroke of luck: big banking and big industry abandoned Fillon and turned to Macron.\n\n“There is something Napoleonic in Macron’s brilliant career, he knew how to take risks at the right time and people followed him,” summarizes Valls, who in recent times has gotten closer to his old enemy. As soon as he found out that his rival in the second round would be far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, Macron already felt like a president. And he held a big party at La Rotonde, which was premature according to some and inappropriate according to others, because back then it was considered a disgrace for the far right to even reach the second round of voting.\n\nNobody considers that Macron’s five-year term has been a success. Macron has shown that he knows a lot about France, but very little about the French. La République en Marche, the presidential version of En Marche!, is not a party, but rather a group of clappers dazzled by their leader. The absence of internal criticism, the small role played by members of the government (with the exception of the economy minister, the conservative Bruno Le Maire) and the character of Macron have turned the presidency into a one-man affair.\n\nMacron, the candidate “of the right and of the left,” is a right-wing president. “He has developed a system of government that is too vertical, he has not been able to create a true center party and he has not been able to reach consensus and state pacts,” criticizes Manuel Valls.\n\nThe prosperous and urban France brought Macron to the Elysee. Macron made the mistake of governing for that France alone, and not for the other one that is rural, poorly paid and depends on diesel and subsidies. He insisted on underestimating the revolt of the “yellow vests,” with whom his prime minister, the conservative Édouard Philippe, rejected any negotiation. The president put an end to the crisis by taking to the streets in person to hold large public debates that lasted entire days.\n\nMacron, along with his wife, Brigitte, inside Nanterre stadium, on the outskirts of Paris, on April 2. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nHe was unable to enjoy his success. The pandemic emerged and the liberal economic policy was transformed into a policy of massive subsidies. Now, inflation and war have accentuated the exceptionality. The mysterious phrase issued by Jacques Attali, his great mentor, will always float over the politics of Emmanuel Macron: “Macron embodies nothingness.”\n\nThe philosopher\n\nEmmanuel Macron relentlessly feeds his aura as a president-philosopher, as a romantic intellectual who cannot end the day without reading some of René Char’s poems or immersing himself in a metaphysical treatise. There is, however, a flaw in the character. Macron was twice rejected at the École Normale Supérieure (Normal Sup), the true Olympus of the humanities in France. He had to settle for studying philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, where admission is much easier. It is true that the double rejection occurred at a stormy time, when the young Emmanuel and Brigitte had just broken ties with their past and taken refuge in Paris.\n\n"Perhaps the legend of Macron as a great intellectual has been exaggerated, and perhaps he has done his best to exaggerate that legend," says one of France\'s most renowned philosophers, a man who participated in some of the Bercy dinners and prefers not to be cited. "I see him more as a great technocrat, banker and high official, with a sensitivity to culture and humanistic concerns, but with a relatively superficial philosophical knowledge."\n\nGaspard Gantzer insists that Macron sees himself as a writer. A writer without any written work, in any case. The current president often speaks of the influence exerted on him by Paul Ricoeur, the great figure of French phenomenology, a unanimously respected humanist and socialist philosopher. “It was Ricoeur who pushed me into politics,” he once said.\n\nMacron helped Ricoeur as an editorial assistant on his latest and best-known work, Memory, History, Forgetting. Basically, he looked for documentation and wrote up the bibliographic records. He took advantage of his relationship with Ricoeur to get on the editorial board of Esprit, the best-known French journal on philosophy, and publish a few articles with very little impact.\n\nThe current president graduated in philosophy (he is also a finance inspector) with a thesis on Machiavelli, whose work he has not stopped reading. The “Jupiterian” tone of his presidency, in the most majestic sense of the term, and his predilection for results, rather than for theories and principles, are possibly related to his Machiavellian studies.\n\n“They say that Macron exercises power as an enlightened despot, which has its logic, because enlightened despotism is the system that is usually associated with the prince-philosopher,” said Francis Wolff, a professor emeritus of philosophy at Normal Sup and a world authority on Aristotle, in statements to the authors of The traitor and the void.\n\nThere is almost unanimous agreement in his close circle about Macron’s talent when it comes to reciting poetry. He has memorized thousands of verses, his delivery is strong and he uses the resources of an actor. If necessary, he can also sit down at the piano: he studied it for 10 years.

Le Pen\'s result this time around was the best ever for the far right.\n\nMacron acknowledged some of the challenges he now faces in his victory speech Sunday night in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\n“Our country is beset by doubts and divisions,” he said. “Today’s vote requires us to consider all the hardships of people’s lives and to respond effectively to them and to the anger expressed.”\n\nThe French president has a long to-do list, ranging from preparing for key parliamentary elections in June to implementing his long-delayed pension reform plans and dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron also has to contend with an energised far left, many of whom backed far-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round and voted for the incumbent in the final round only to stop a far-right victory.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. Mélenchon’s France is not reconcilable with Le Pen’s, he said.

Its main policies of lowering the retirement age to 60 years, raising the minimum wage, price freezes and the ushering in of a “Sixth Republic” are not negotiable.\n\nLFI also wants its own candidates to be allowed to run in the number of constituencies that is proportional to its vote share in the presidentials. Then there’s a tricky question of how bound the coalition would be to European treaties.\n\nA handful of those are at odds with Mélenchon’s policy platform, which he says he wants to implement even if it means breaking EU rules.\n\nEuropean MP Yannick Jadot, who came third in the presidentials on the Europe-Ecologie Les Verts (EELV) greens party ticket, wants France to move towards more European integration.\n\nUnnamed EELV sources told BMFTV that Mélenchon’s demands were too great and risked “erasing” the platforms of other leftist parties altogether.\n\nJadot himself told France Inter radio on Tuesday that he was broadly in favour of a left-wing coalition, but not with Mélenchon as its leader.\n\n"We have such a responsibility on the climate," he said – adding the left needed a “very open" coalition that respected "the diversity and identity of its partners”.\n\nEELV’s own internal divisions – notably between Jadot and the party\'s national secretary Julien Bayou – may also prove a stumbling block to any future alliance.\n\nThe latter has conceded that time is running out and “the dice must be thrown this week” on the matter.\n\n.@yjadot : "Je soutiens la perspective d\'une coalition, qui doit être une coalition très ouverte.

Despite the paltry 1.75 percent of the vote managed by presidential hopeful Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists still enjoy a well-established local power base, with 28 lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nA representative of the Communist Party (PCF) told BFMTV that the “disrespectful” number of constituencies offered to them meant the jury was still out on their involvement in a possible coalition.\n\n"There is still too much uncertainty to say whether the Communists will accept this agreement or slam the door," the PCF member said.\n\nElsewhere, LFI is also in talks with the New Anti-Capitalist Party, which has responded favourably and has been openly pushing LFI’s notion that the June polls represent a "third round” of the presidential contest.\n\nAll 577 deputy seats in the lower house will be up for grabs on 12 and 19 June, with LREM likely to meet stiff resistance.

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us. Tonight we tell them that we will continue to transform Europe by their side”, she added.\n\nWhile Macron received many congratulations from his European counterparts, he acknowledged his victory was not as self-evident as last time.\n\n“Many of our compatriots voted for me, not to support the ideas I put forward, but to block the extreme right”, he told the crowd, thanking them and committing to address these divisions.\n\n“Our challenge is to restore French unity. The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

At the same time, most age groups were split more evenly between Macron and Le Pen; the only group that went all out for the incumbent president were the 18-to-24-year-olds. Yes, Generation Z, the post-millennials, saved Macron. And not so much because of their outpouring love for the president, but out of their fear of the alternative.\n\nThe French presidential election system was set up this way by President Charles de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic. The two-round system (no one gets 51% of the votes in the first round) often forces a second-round competition between a centrist and an extremist candidate, and the majority always prefers the centrist. Next, France will have a parliamentary election and the reelected Macron will campaign for the voters to give his party the majority so that his premiere would be from his own party and not, embarrassingly, from the opposition. He’ll get that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo, how come, on Monday morning, the euro fell 0.34% against the dollar, to $1.07725, close to its two-year low last week? Reuters suggested investors may be relieved to see that Le Pen is not in office, but this doesn’t mean they have high expectations of the winner. Still, the nationalist Le Pen promised to nationalize some key parts of France’s industry, cut taxes radically, and curtail France’s participation in the EU budget. The nightmare is over, investors, what’s holding y’all back?\n\nTurns out the future of the world’s economy is mired in anxiety: US stocks are not performing; futures are declining; China is being revisited by the pandemic it may have invented, so large chunks of its workforce are under lockdowns; supply chains are getting bogged down even worse than before; and Putin continues to try to salvage some measure of victory over Ukraine in time for May 9, the anniversary of the Red Army’s victory over the Nazis.\n\nThe dollar roared over in Israel, too, where it struck NIS 3.27 for the first time in who knows how long. It has probably more to do with the Fed raising interest rates recently than with French politics, but it couldn’t come at a better time, when Israel is struggling to retool its economy and restart its lavish exports again.\n\nMost French Jews heaved a sigh of relief over Macron’s win, especially Orthodox Jews – who would normally align with the right-wing candidate. The reason is that Le Pen, despite her cosmetic efforts, is more an old-fashion fascist than a modern-day extreme right-winger. As part of her fierce anti-immigration (some say xenophobic) policy, she promised to ban animal slaughter without stunning, insisting that stunning the animal is more humane. Of course, stunning renders the animal as “traif” for both Jews and Muslims, who threatened that they would leave France if they were deprived of their kosher and halal meat (If Le Pen Wins, She’ll Ban Kosher Shechita in France).\n\nAnd since France exports kosher meat, a ban on its production in France would have had a devastating impact on Jewish communities elsewhere, most notably in neighboring Switzerland.\n\nMany right-wing Israelis didn’t see a big distinction between Macron and Le Pen because both support the two-state solution and a Palestinian state. But if that’s your litmus test, then most Western and Third-World countries should be classified as anti-Israel. I thought Macron stood out as a friend a couple of weeks ago, when he clashed with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, calling him a “far-right antisemite.” So Emanuel can’t be all bad.\n\nHere’s what happened: Morawiecki compared the French president’s phone calls with Vladimir Putin to negotiating with Hitler. Now, you may support Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine or be against them, but they just don’t compare with what Hitler did to most of Europe and the rest of the planet. In response, Macron told Le Parisien that Morawiecki was trying to help Le Pen, and called him a “far-right antisemite who bans LGBT persons” in his country.\n\nA spokesman for Morawiecki said it was a lie and the Polish PM wasn’t an antisemite. But he kind of is. In 2018 he said Jews were involved in perpetrating the Holocaust (which would have been a brilliant solution to the supply chain problems). And Morawiecki is also behind the Polish law that punishes anyone who blames Poles for taking part in the Nazi Holocaust crimes.\n\nAnd, in June 2021, after Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called the new Polish law barring Jews from filing Holocaust restitution claims in Poland “immoral,” PM Morawiecki said, “I can only say that as long as I am the prime minister, Poland will not pay for German crimes: Neither zloty, nor euro, nor dollar.”\n\nSee? It always comes down to economics.

The centre has held. Yesterday (24 April), 2022 stopped being 2022 just long enough for Emmanuel Macron to see off Marine Le Pen and secure re-election as the president of France. The result came as a great relief to millions around the world.\n\n\n\nMany are tempted to try and read into the result some grander narrative in which Europe remains a sort of liberal Hyperborea, a paradise from which the British expelled themselves in 2016 (together with Americans in electing Donald Trump). On closer inspection, however, this conception doesn’t quite square with the bald reality: the Rassemblement National (RN), a party explicitly rooted in the post-fascist far right, has just taken 41 per cent of the second-round vote in one of the European Union’s most important member states.\n\nAdmirers in Britain have long been prepared to overlook the unfortunate truth that France is home to one of the world’s largest white far-right parties. While Macron might have won yesterday’s election, the trend of the far right is only upward in France. Back in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, first broke through to contest the second round of the presidential election, French voters united around Jacques Chirac and rejected the Front National (as the RN was known at the time) by more than four to one. The elder Le Pen took less than 18 per cent of the second-round vote. Yet in 2017, his daughter Marine won more than 33 per cent – and yesterday, she won 41 per cent. Furthermore, while in Britain even the respectable right has serious trouble wooing younger voters, polling by YouGov has suggested that in France the RN is ahead with voters aged 18-24, as well as winning voters directly from the far left.\n\nFrance is not the only EU country to display this trend, however: there are plenty of other correctives for anyone who, despairing of the UK’s current government, might pine for a lost Eden across the English Channel. Across southern Europe the long political legacy of the EU’s tough response to the financial crisis plays out in the rise of right-wing parties that, like the RN, harbour more or less explicit links to historical anti-democratic movements. Italy not only contains the populist party Lega Nord but its smaller ally Fratelli d’Italia, whose logo features the familiar tricoloured flame of the postwar far right.\n\nRelated\n\nIn Spain meanwhile, Vox, a party with Francoist undertones, has outflanked Madrid’s traditional parties of the right on the question of Spanish unity, and secured its first beachhead in government. In eastern Europe, there is the organised, multinational challenge of the Visegrád Group; while in wealthy northern Europe, the social democratic Danish government recently adopted what Foreign Policy called “one of the harshest refugee policies in the world”.\n\nIn contrast, despite the performative toughness of the Rwanda proposals, the United Kingdom operates what the statistics show to be a pretty liberal immigration regime. Whatever its flaws, no sober observer can conflate the Conservative Party with the far-right movements gaining ground on the continent.\n\nNone of this is proof that Brexit was a good idea, of course, nor that France and Europe are not home to real liberal achievements. But we should accept that a country in which Le Pen takes 40 per cent of the vote is no nirvana.', 'image': 'https://www.newstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1236459286-1038x778.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:50'}

Faced with the prospect of a far-right takeover of the Élysée, a sufficient number of voters put aside their reservations regarding Emmanuel Macron and made him the first president to win a second term in office for 20 years. In the end, Mr Macron’s 58%-42% victory over Marine Le Pen was much more comfortable than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when some polls predicted a knife-edge contest.\n\nFor France – and the rest of Europe – the alternative outcome would have been disastrous and destabilising. Ms Le Pen’s authoritarian, nationalist and xenophobic vision would have led to civil strife domestically and undermined solidarity between western democracies at a vital time. That Mr Macron successfully averted this worst-case scenario is a cause for celebration. But as his victory speech on Sunday night tacitly acknowledged, an election won with the help of the fear factor has delivered an exceptionally fragile mandate. Describing France as riven by doubt and division, Mr Macron pledged to be “not the candidate of one camp, but the president of all of us”. Such assurances are commonplace from victorious political leaders, but it is vital that Mr Macron makes good on them during a second term, which looks challenging to say the least.\n\nAs the election laid bare, France is dangerously divided along economic and generational fault lines. A majority of blue-collar workers – and more than four in 10 voters overall – opted for Ms Le Pen. This, the best score in the history of the French far right, allowed Ms Le Pen to declare her share of the vote a “victory in itself”. Disturbingly, it indicates that the normalisation of her movement is all but complete. Mr Macron’s core vote, by contrast, came from wealthy business people, middle-class professionals and retired people. Younger, well educated but economically precarious voters who supported the radical left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round were left without a dog in the fight.\n\nReflecting widespread disillusionment with the choice on offer, particularly among the young, the rate of abstention was the highest for a presidential runoff since 1969. Among potential voters under the age of 25, more than 40% failed to cast a ballot. Enough voters on the left lent their support to Mr Macron to keep the far right out of power, but in fewer numbers than in 2017. Hostilities on the right and the left will now be resumed ahead of parliamentary elections in June.\n\nIf he is to successfully navigate this volatile political landscape, Mr Macron will need to adopt a radically different playbook from the one that characterised his first five years in the Élysée. During that time, he acquired a reputation as the “president of the rich” after watering down a wealth tax, pursuing unpopular pension reforms and imposing a fuel tax that sparked the gilets jaunes movement. An autocratic style contributed to the widespread impression that Mr Macron’s declared intention to transform and liberalise the French economy would be accomplished at the expense of the less well-off.\n\nTo make good on his aspirations to reach out across the divides, Mr Macron will need to do far more to address such concerns and insecurities. During a campaign that became unexpectedly close, there were signs that this was being recognised. In an encouraging early statement of intent, it has already been signalled that there will be full consultation with unions and other bodies over proposals to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, in a still fragile post-Covid economy, Mr Macron should also recognise that more needs to be done to protect and improve the living standards of blue-collar workers and the youthful precariat, which voted en masse for Mr Mélenchon. As he contemplates five more years in office, Mr Macron must realise that he has been given not so much a mandate as another chance.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f9dc305d6b01ad6e862da6d17afc1f0e1d372f/0_0_4625_2774/master/4625.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4f9959a701f15dfce678c4ac1137a3cd', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:42'}

The 3ᵉ round, on June 12 and 19, promises to be boiling hot.\n\nOn the evening of the first round, April 10, we wrote that France resembled a still smoldering battlefield, with its dead and wounded, its routed armies and the new strategies developed by military leaders to fight new battles.\n\nIn the aftermath of the second round, which gave a clear victory to Emmanuel Macron (58.54% of the votes cast against 41.46% for Marine Le Pen), the presidential camp has a modest victory. And rightly so. For everyone knows that it is a victory in trompe-l’oeil: it gives the illusion of reality.\n\nIncumbent president already rejected\n\nLet’s look at the figures. Emmanuel Macron obtained 18,779,641 votes on April 24, 2022, i.e. 58.54% of the votes cast, putting him well ahead of the election. But this flattering score falls to 38.52% of the electorate, i.e. the registered voters. In other words, nearly two thirds of the French did not vote Macron. Worse: between 2017 and 2022, Macron lost 1,963,487 votes! This is not the triumph that we would like to believe.\n\nAt the same time, Marine Le Pen totals 13,297,760 votes (27.28% of registered voters) and gains 2,659,285 votes in five years !\n\n63% of the French for a cohabitation\n\nThese figures attest to the rejection of the re-elected president and his policies during his five-year term. It is so true that an OpinionWay poll for Cnews reveals “that one person in three who voted Macron in the second round wants him not to have a majority in the National Assembly.” And 63% of the French registered voters want a cohabitation with the appointment of a Prime Minister from an opposition party.\n\nIn other words, many voters voted for Macron to block Marine Le Pen, but they do not want Macron to govern. Here is France divided, fractured, more divided than ever.\n\nCut up like a puzzle\n\nGone is the France cut in two of our youth, with a permanent confrontation between left and right who governed in turn according to the principle of the pendulum. Here is France cut into small pieces, like a puzzle. If it is true that the first round revealed the tri-polarization of French political life, the second round shows us a France of the elites against a France of the people, a France of the big cities against a France of the rural areas, a France of the “bobos”, happy and rich, and a France of the eternally forgotten, of the poor (there are 10 million of them) who can neither find decent housing, nor heat, nor food, nor entertainment.\n\nIn these conditions, how can one be the president “of all the French”? Macron’s France will become a country regularly shaken by political and social convulsions, like the Gilets jaunes. The legislative elections of June 12 and 19 will give us a glimpse of the turmoil that will shake the country under the Macron presidency.', 'image': 'https://frenchdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Macron1-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:25'}

Berlin has not only hit the brakes when it comes to EU sanctions, but its refusal to supply heavy weapons to Ukraine has also reduced its leadership potential.\n\n“I think Germany has to be content now with playing at best the second, maybe even the third role in Europe. And that, of course, is partly due to the dithering and hesitation of Chancellor Olaf Scholz,” Vöpel said.\n\nAt the same time, the war has also exposed the weaknesses of its policies of the last few decades that concern Russia.\n\nWhile France always warned against too much economic dependence on Russia – especially concerning the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – Germany’s Russia policy was driven by the attempt to bring Russia closer to the West through closer economic integration. This approach has largely failed, considering Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Germany is also much more isolated than France in other areas. Macron, for example, has sought a close alliance with his Italian counterpart, Mario Draghi, on reforming European debt rules.\n\n“Particularly in the face of the current crises, Macron will try to work with Draghi to push for increased financial leeway to be able to shoulder the necessary investments,” emphasised Vöpel.\n\nAlthough Germany, in particular, has been hesitant to support the reform and the loosening of the EU’s fiscal rules, the balance of power in Europe has shifted toward the reform of rules, he added.\n\nGerman position in the EU\n\nHowever, Germany’s positions now coincide with Macron’s visions in many areas, most notably the attempt to foster European sovereignty.\n\nWhile Macron’s calls for a sovereign Europe in his keynote speech at the Sorbonne in 2017 were mainly left unanswered by the German government, the issue is now also topping the agenda in Germany. Scholz’s Zeitenwende is already profoundly anchored in German discourse and goes beyond the Ukraine war’s immediate effects.\n\nLast Wednesday, for example, Finance Minister Christian Lindner called for a complete strategic reset of German policy.\n\n“We have placed ourselves at a triple risk. We have become too dependent when it comes to energy from Russia, security from the U.S. and business with China,” Lindner told Focus Online.

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But many begrudged having to support Macron.\n\nThey see him as a lofty, arrogant manager, who\'s disconnected from their day-to-day worries.\n\nSome therefore even opted to abstain or vote for Le Pen, their priority instead to block Macron from staying in power.\n\nIt\'s far from certain that, presented with the same scenario five years down the road, those Mélenchon supporters who did vote for Macron would do so again.\n\nThat\'s why the president reelect needs to urgently start implementing more left-wing and ecological measures. Macron needs to change his ways and show that he does understand the suffering of those who feel left behind, in order to give left-wing voters the feeling that he is an acceptable alternative.\n\nThe president indicated in his speech he\'d do all this. Now, he needs to follow through with it.\n\nIf he doesn\'t, that could lead to, or at least contribute to, a further stengthened far-right.

Far-right Marine Le Pen and veteran leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round of voting, both hope to mobilise voters to form a strong parliamentary opposition to the freshly re-elected president.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nWith a 17-point lead over his far-right rival, Macron secured a decisive victory against Le Pen in Sunday’s presidential run-off, dashing her hopes of an upset win as he did in 2017. But Le Pen made major gains, cutting Macron’s margin nearly in half compared to five years ago, when he defeated her 66 points to 34.\n\nLe Pen is keen to channel that momentum into the next round of voting: France’s legislative elections, on June 12 and 19. Speaking shortly after the results were announced Sunday, she urged her supporters to turn to the “great battle” ahead.\n\n“Tonight we launch the great battle of the legislative elections,” Le Pen said. “I will lead this battle alongside Jordan Bardella, with all those who had the courage to oppose Emmanuel Macron in the second round, with all those who have France at heart.”\n\nLe Pen, herself a member of France’s National Assembly since 2017, representing the northern Pas-de-Calais region, sought to present her party as the leading force of opposition to Macron.\n\n“The National Rally will seek to rally those who want to come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from, in order to field and support candidates everywhere,” she said.\n\nSpeaking on news channel TF1, the National Rally's acting president Bardella described the June elections as the “third round” of presidential voting.\n\n‘The third round begins tonight’\n\nLeftist Mélenchon, for his part, expressed his satisfaction with Le Pen’s defeat.\n\n“It’s very good news for the unity of our people,” Mélenchon said.

The two finalists on Sunday had the support of “barely over a third of registered voters”, he said, before also turning to the legislative elections.\n\n“Don’t give up,” said Mélenchon, an opposition MP since 2017, representing parts of Marseille. “The third round begins tonight. On June 12 and 19, another world is still possible if you elect a majority of MPs from the new popular union, which must continue to grow.”\n\nAfter Le Pen edged him out in the first round, Mélenchon had called on voters to elect him prime minister in the legislative elections. His campaign director Manuel Bompard still believes he has a chance.\n\nMélenchon can still be prime minister, “not to be prime minister but to pass his platform, freeze prices, raise the minimum wage, and put in place a Sixth Republic”, Bompard said.\n\nÀ toutes et à tous, je dis : ne vous résignez pas.

The future of Europe lies in our hands. Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his victory!”.\n\nThe opposition tried to link Le Pen’s defeat to the Polish conservative PiS government, which has clashed with Brussels over the rule of law. During the migration crisis with Belarus, Macron had told the Polish prime minister that the EU would stand by them but would not overlook the rule of law concerns.\n\n“A day will come that we will have Paris in Warsaw”, opposition centrist leader Donald Tusk (Civic Platform) said.\n\nThe topic of Russia was very present in politicians’ reactions.\n\n“Thanks to Macron’s victory, there will be more Europe in Europe […] And less Russia”, Tusk added.\n\nCentre-right lawmaker Jarosław Gowin (Porozumienie party) said Macron saved France from the pro-Putin Le Pen while the “hopes of PiS leaders to build a strong Eurosceptic bloc are dashed. The next congress of the leaders of the populist right will be a congress of losers.”\n\n“A victory for Marine Le Pen would be a victory for the vision of a Europe of selfish states, of which the Kremlin would be most happy,” commented Władysław Kosiniak – Kamysz, a lawmaker for the centrist/agrarian Polish People’s Party.\n\n“France and Europe defended by Emmanuel Macron against hatred, backwardness, and Putin,” tweeted Maciej Gdula, a social-democratic lawmaker from the New Left.\n\nIn Prague, which will soon take over from France the EU Council rotating presidency, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala (ODS, ECR) said France is a “vital partner”, while Czech Parliament’s speaker Markéta Pekarová Adamová (TOP 09, EPP) said populism and nationalism have lost and that France will continue to be a partner in the EU and NATO.\n\nIn Slovakia, Defence Minister Jaroslav Naď (OĽaNO) stated Macron’s re-election is “excellent news for whole democratic world”, stressing the clear stance of Macron towards Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nIn Hungary, so far, there has been no official government reaction.\n\nEuropean federalist MEP Dobrev Klára from Democratic Coalition (DK) hailed Macron’s victory, while “Viktor Orban’s ally and friend in the region, Janez Janša, and his populist right-wing Slovenian Democratic Party lost the elections […] Both is great news for Europe’s friends”.\n\nThe German message\n\n“Your voters have also sent a strong message of commitment to Europe today,” German chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Twitter. During this election, finance minister Christian Lindner added that France was standing at the crossroads, stressing that “the united Europe is the biggest winner of this election.”\n\nHowever, the strong result of Le Pen has prompted concern. Ahead of Macron now lies the task of “rallying the French people, who voted strongly for right-wing and left-wing populists in this round of elections, probably out of disappointment, behind the political centre again,” Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesperson of the conservative CDU told EURACTIV.\n\nThe result is a “serious reminder” to the French president that “France now needs a social and ecological renewal” as France is facing “deep social divides,” a senior Social Democrat, MEP Udo Bullmann, told EURACTIV.\n\n“Emmanuel Macron’s election victory was more important for Europe than the German federal election. France has voted against right-wing populism and resentment and favoured President Macron’s Europe,” chancellor candidate for the CDU/CSU in 2021, Armin Laschet, told EURACTIV.\n\nAustrian and Dutch leaders also focused on the pro-EU signal of Macron’s victory.\n\nIn Rome, Madrid, Lisbon and Athens, leaders highlighted France’s commitment to the European project.\n\nIn Italy, Lega leader Matteo Salvini congratulated Le Pen, tweeting: “Congratulations, Marine! Alone against everyone, coherent and smiling, you have gathered the vote of 13 million French people, an unprecedented rate. Together for a Europe based on work, family, security, rights and freedom”.\n\nGreek MEP Stelios Kouloglou told EURACTIV that all polls show that disadvantaged French people support the far-right candidate as they feel marginalised by the political and social system. “Far-right demagogues are all over Europe are waiting if the problems of the vast majority are not solved.”\n\n“Five years is very little in history. In France, the next match may have very unpleasant surprises. For now, France and the EU are saved.

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

Police used tear gas to disperse gatherings in Paris and the western city of Rennes.\n\n- New era -\n\nIn a victory speech on the Champ de Mars in central Paris at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, Macron vowed to respond to the anger of voters who backed his far-right rival, saying his new term would not continue unchanged from the last five years.\n\n"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right," he told thousands of cheering supporters.\n\n"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me."\n\nHe also pledged a "renewed method" to govern France, adding that this "new era" would not be one of "continuity with the last term which is now ending".\n\nIn a combative speech to supporters in Paris in which she accepted the result but showed no sign of quitting politics, Le Pen, 53, said she would "never abandon" the French and was already preparing for the June legislative elections.\n\n"The result represents a brilliant victory," she said to cheers.\n\n"This evening, we launched the great battle for the legislative elections," Le Pen said, adding that she felt "hope" and calling on opponents of the president to join with her National Rally (RN) party.\n\n- \'Count on France\' -\n\nThe result is narrower than the second-round clash in 2017, when the same two candidates met in the run-off and Macron polled over 66 percent of the vote.\n\nFor Le Pen, her third defeat in presidential polls will be a bitter pill to swallow after she plowed years of effort into making herself electable and distancing her party from the legacy of its founder, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nCritics insisted her party never stopped being extreme-right and racist while Macron repeatedly pointed to her plan to ban the wearing of the Muslim headscarf in public if elected.\n\nThe projections caused immense relief in Europe after fears a Le Pen presidency would leave the continent rudderless following Brexit and the departure from politics of German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news for all of Europe" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nEU president Charles Michel said the bloc could now "count on France for five more years" while Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also congratulated him, saying she was "delighted to be able to continue our excellent cooperation".\n\nIn another election Sunday, Slovenia\'s three-time Prime Minister Janez Jansa, criticized by opponents as an authoritarian right-wing populist, was at risk of losing power to a party led by political newcomer Robert Golob.\n\n- \'Ocean of abstention\' -\n\nMacron will be hoping for a less complicated second term that will allow him to implement his vision of more pro-business reform and tighter EU integration, after a first term shadowed by protests, then the pandemic and finally Russia\'s military operation in Ukraine.\n\nBut he will have to win over those who backed his opponents and the millions of French who did not bother to vote.\n\nPolling organizations estimated turnout of just 72 percent, the lowest in any presidential election second-round run-off since 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, according to partial results, 6.45 percent of voters in the election voted for neither candidate in blank ballots while 2.35 percent spoilt their papers.\n\nThe hard-left third-placed candidate in the first round, Jean-Luc Melenchon, had refused to endorse Macron.\n\nHe has his eyes firmly set on the June elections.\n\nMelenchon welcomed Le Pen\'s defeat as "very good news for the unity of our people" but said Le Pen and Macron had barely managed to win a third of support from registered voters.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots", he said.', 'image': 'https://cdnimgen.royanews.tv/imageserv/Size728Q40/news/20220425/35368.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:44'}

And so do U.S. voters in general, not just Republicans. Nearly 60 percent of those who participated in a recent Gallup poll said there was too much immigration into the country. That makes anti-immigrant sentiment mainstream. Le Pen\'s platform also proposed that non-citizen immigrants arrested for any crime be sent back to their country of origin. This fringe position in France is the law of the land in America and has been for years.\n\n"They\'re bringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime. They\'re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," Donald Trump said on the day in 2015 that he announced he was running for president. During his tenure in office, Trump took many different steps to limit immigration, and not just the illegal sort. In fact, in 2020, he reduced the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. by 49 percent.\n\nWhat puts Le Pen and the National Rally Party in the far-right corner of politics, then? Like her near-fascist father before her, Le Pen isn\'t fond of immigrants, and I mean really not fond . She wants them to assimilate to French culture to the point where they would be indistinguishable from France\'s original immigrants (or rather, invaders), the Germanic Franks, who came for a visit to the Roman Empire in the 4th century and never went away. But even more than assimilating, Le Pen and her party would much rather immigrants just go back to where they came from.\n\nAnalysts all over the world woke up on Monday morning to mourn the fact that far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen wasn\'t beaten soundly enough, even though she lost by more than 16 points to a man few people in France apparently love , the incumbent Emmanuel Macron.\n\nNational Rally is also famously skeptical of international alliances, especially those with NATO and the European Union. France is one of the founding members of the EU, and along with Germany, forms its heart. For France to leave the Union would gut it, and possibly bring an end to the "European project" of peace and economic cooperation for the continent. But such actions don\'t send a shudder down the spine of Americans; Trump for his part killed a major trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, threatened to undo America\'s free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, pulled out of the Paris climate treaty, and came closer than we ever knew to essentially pulling the U.S. out of NATO — all to the applause of many Republicans.\n\nTrump was not standing out in the cold on the issue of NATO, either. Before the war in Ukraine, only 48 percent of Americans thought the organization was doing a good job, and a full 65 percent of Republicans thought it was doing a poor job. If France is the heart of the EU, the U.S. simply is NATO. The U.S. founded the alliance and provides a shield for the other members that fall under the American aegis. This may change, thanks Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s war in Ukraine, which has forced Europe to rethink its role in its own defense, but as of right now, U.S. leadership is clear and unquestioned.\n\nAnd speaking of the war in Ukraine and Russia in general, Le Pen and Trump share something else: A love for Putin. Over and over, Trump praised Putin for his intelligence, strength, and the high quality of his negotiating tactics. He even asked for Russia to help him get dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, which is widely believed to have been tainted by Russian interference, both online and off. Le Pen is also deeply tied to Putin, speaking warmly of the autocrat while her National Rally happily took Russian money. She has praised Putin\'s nationalism and skepticism of globalization.\n\nLe Pen\'s economic policies are not a one-to-one correlation with those in the GOP — this is France after all, so some "socialism" on health care and other issues are required — but the fear of corporate globalism is exactly the same. Trump\'s "America First" economics fit very well with Le Pen\'s ideas.\n\nOn social issues, National Rally had to moderate several positions to become competitive in France. Gay marriage and abortion play their part in the political process over there, just as they do here, and Le Pen had to loosen up. The difference here is that America\'s far-right is succeeding in protecting the "traditional values" of the Dark Ages.\n\nSo could Le Pen be elected in America? No, she\'s a foreigner. But as far as her positions go, there\'s very little to bar a politician like her. We\'ve already voted for people on the local and national levels who make Le Pen practically look like a liberal. Even her position that Muslims should not be allowed to wear headscarves in public places, while extreme, falls in line with overall American feelings about Muslims.\n\nEven now, as President Biden is being praised elsewhere in the world for rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and reaffirming America\'s commitment to NATO, there are viable presidential candidates waiting in the wings to undo that work. And even if they don\'t win in 2024, chances are they\'ll be a lot closer to the White House than 16 points behind.', 'image': 'https://mediacloud.theweek.com/image/upload/s--X-WVjvBW--/f_auto,t_content-image-full-desktop@1/v1650910407/Trump le pen.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

[…] They have no potential to form an alliance”, and it is easier for “the forces around the centre to form an alliance”, Diamantopoulos told EURACTIV France.\n\nBut in recent days, Mélenchon has unequivocally called on his supporters: “I ask you to elect me Prime minister”.\n\nBetween the fact that “there will be no defections” in favour of Mélenchon’s party and the “under-representation of the extremes”, the possibility that his appeal will become a reality in the ballot box remains dim.\n\nAnother element that works against the most radical parties is that “there are two ‘anti-system’ expressions, one on the far right and the other on the left”.\n\nFor these reasons, eight deputies were elected under the banner of the Rassemblement National in 2017, despite qualifying for the second round of the presidential election, and Mélenchon’s party had seventeen. These results are far below the overall results at the national level.\n\nThe (new) attempt to unite the left\n\nOn the left, the urgent need for unity is being felt both by executives and voters, in order to regain influence and hope to impose a social and ecological majority on Macron.\n\nContacted by EURACTIV France, Sylvie Guillaume, a Socialist MEP, said she hoped that “the legislative elections [will make it possible to] restore a better balance because the presidential election is not a blank check” for the newly re-elected president.\n\nThe same is true of the Insoumis — Mélenchon’s supporters — who want to believe in uniting the left.\n\nMEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV France that her movement “appeals to those who do not feel represented” and admits to being in discussion with the other left-wing forces, to agree on “a common base”.\n\nThe call of Mélenchon and his supporters seem to have been heard by the other left-wing movements. Europe Ecologie Les Verts MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV France that “the political forces of the left and the ecologists must organise themselves to weigh together if they do not want to condemn themselves to lose separately”.\n\nLéon Deffontaines, president of the young communists’ movement, told EURACTIV France he hoped to see “the ideas of equality, sharing and solidarity become the majority again”.\n\nCommunist candidate Fabien Roussel pleaded on Sunday evening for a “global agreement” of the left, demanding that “local anchors and different sensibilities on the left be taken into account” in order to avoid the distribution benefiting only La France Insoumise, which largely dominated the left in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nYet, according to Diamantopoulos, even if “some constituencies [the left] could get some MPs elected” the idea of “getting close to a parliamentary majority is a political fiction”.\n\nWhat majority for Macron?\n\nDespite the parliamentary challenges, Macron will not throw in the towel.\n\nJudging by the comments of Gabriel Attal, spokesman for the outgoing government, confidence in Macron’s camp remains high.\n\n“I am convinced that the French will give the president of the republic the means to act to protect them, with a majority [in the National Assembly],” Attal told BFMTV-RMC on Monday morning.\n\nHaving limited manoeuvring room due to a lack of partisan alliances beyond the existing majority, Macron’s camp will try to convince voters of other political inclinations or, at best, conclude circumstantial agreements in the territories where this is possible.\n\nDiamantopoulos believes Macron could build a “presidential majority that would start with the former Gaullists (centre-right Républicains) and reach the hinge of the left, including perhaps even a part of the Socialist Party and, of course, the ecologists”.\n\nMacron must therefore, according to Diamantopoulos, “wink at the ecologists” the day after the election. His promise to appoint a prime minister “in charge of ecological planning” would be a step in this direction.\n\nBut the question is: when will this appointment take place? Diamantopoulos warned that this plan could be changed, depending on the results of the legislative elections, which will tilt the future government more to the right or the left, and thus define Macron’s alliance choices.\n\nAs a reminder, in 2017 he chose Edouard Philippe from the centre-right as prime minister, even though he was not forced to do so, having acquired a solid majority in the Assembly, as well as several other ministers from the right.\n\nAt the same time, Macron will also have to devote some of his energy to the French EU presidency.\n\n“He needs to ensure the ongoing French EU presidency is a success. It ends on June 30 and there is an upcoming conference on the Western Balkans to be organised soon, which provides an opportunity to start rethinking the EU’s enlargement policy,” Tara Varma of the European Council on Foreign Relations told EURACTIV in emailed comments.\n\n“Macron will have to take the mantle of European diplomatic leadership again. He mentioned Ukraine in his victory speech. He should travel to Kyiv immediately with (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz to demonstrate Europe’s support for Ukraine,” she said.\n\nBig relief after Macron's re-election but 'third round' ahead French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to unite a deeply divided nation after winning re-election on Sunday (24 April) in a battle against rival Marine Le Pen that saw the far right come its closest yet to taking power.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]", 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57636418-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

FRANCE 24 takes a look at some of the main takeaways from France\'s presidential vote.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nA nation divided\n\nA post-election map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country while Le Pen won backing in the struggling northern industrial heartlands, the Mediterranean south and French overseas territories.\n\nBig city centres, the upper-middle classes and older voters backed Macron while lower-income groups voted overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\nBut according to Mathieu Gallard, research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, it would be a mistake to imagine a country divided between an urban pro-Macron camp and rural Le Pen supporters.\n\n"The biggest fractures are, above all, generational and social," said Gallard.\n\nRising abstention\n\nTurnout was at just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest of any second-round vote in France since 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who made the effort to turn up at voting stations on Sunday cast a protest vote to send the message that neither candidate was acceptable. Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nMacron loses the French territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost 3 million.\n\nLe Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nMacron could only claim victory in the Pacific islands such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris.

Le Pen, a French nationalist representing the National Rally Party, called Macron a “climate hypocrite.” He jabbed back, dubbing Le Pen a “climate skeptic.”\n\nFor the moment, Macron has won out. On Sunday, the sitting French president defeated Le Pen with 58.5 percent of the vote — provoking a sigh of relief from many environmental activists, despite their quarrels with Macron during his previous 5-year term.\n\nLe Pen’s energy plan had called for exiting the European Union’s electricity market, accelerating the development of nuclear power, and establishing a moratorium on wind and solar development. (Nuclear currently provides about 70 percent of the country’s electricity; wind and solar combined provide only about 10 percent.) “Wind turbines are ugly and they ruin our landscapes,” Le Pen said in the April 20 debate. The far-right candidate had also vowed to cut the value-added tax on gas, electricity, and oil from 20 percent to 5.5 percent — a move that would have cost the government up to 12 billion euros (nearly $12.9 billion) and boosted demand for fossil fuels.\n\nGrist relies on the support of generous readers like you to keep our climate news free.

Here's How\n\nThe president’s climate policies could also spill over into neighboring European countries. France is currently the leader of the European Union Council, which is tasked with implementing Europe’s “Green Deal” — a massive spending package designed to help the continent get off fossil fuels. And Macron has been one of the most outspoken critics of using Russian coal and oil in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, calling for an outright blockade on the import of those fuels into the E.U. “The results of elections in France always reverberate way beyond the country’s borders,” Lucie Mattera, head of European politics at the think tank E3G, told E&E News last week. “And 2022 is no exception.”\n\nBut critics have argued that the president struggled to implement his climate agenda during his first term. After promising to cut emissions in his first presidential election, in 2017, Macron instituted increases in France’s fuel tax, with the aim of reducing emissions from the transportation sector. The resulting price hike sparked the gilet jaunes, or “yellow vests” movement, with hundreds of thousands of French citizens protesting in the streets.\n\nChagrined, Macron repealed the tax increases and launched a program of public participation in government — including a Citizens’ Convention on Climate, a randomly selected group of 150 voters tasked with helping the country create new climate policy. The president promised to pass their proposals on to the legislature or to a referendum “without filter” — but there, too, he ran into conflict. After the convention released its 149 proposals, Macron preemptively vetoed three of them, including a tax on corporate profits to fund clean energy. Only a few dozen of the citizens’ suggestions ended up in France’s sweeping 2021 climate law, and those often in watered-down form.\n\nIn the short term, the reelected president has promised to create a new prime minister position focused on “ecological planning” and increase investments in renewable technologies. Part of that may be an act of political expediency: Macron was shifted left during the campaign by the popular primary run of the leftist candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who attracted many young voters with his calls for a 200 billion euro ($214 billion) investment in green infrastructure and a constitutional amendment to protect biodiversity. The support for Mélenchon, Macron said in a speech last week, had sent a “powerful message.”", 'image': 'https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron_election_presidential_climate.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France.

He is the teenager who fell in love with a 39-year-old teacher and was loved back in return, the Rothschild banker, the man who betrayed former president François Hollande, the pianist, the technocrat, the lover of poetry and theater, and the seducer. This is the portrait of Emmanuel Macron, 44, in four acts:\n\nThe man\n\nEmmanuel Macron was born in Amiens on December 21, 1977, the son of Jean-Michel, a doctor and professor of neurology, and Françoise, a general practitioner. He was the oldest of three brothers.\n\nThe man and the character were born 15 years later, towards the end of 1992, when the schoolboy fell in love with Brigitte Auzière, born Brigitte Trogneux, his French and drama teacher. The love was reciprocated. The teacher was 39 years old, married to a well-known local banker, and one of her daughters was Emmanuel’s classmate.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the impact of such an unconventional (and currently criminal) relationship in a relatively small, provincial city like Amiens, with a population of around 130,000. Brigitte’s family owned the most famous bakery in town. Emmanuel’s parents were doctors. They all knew each other. The Macrons tried to end the matter by sending their son to Paris. It was useless: Brigitte separated and visited Emmanuel on weekends. For her, Emmanuel was “a Mozart,” a boy who dazzled her with his intelligence and maturity. For him, Brigitte meant and still means everything.\n\nStill a minor, Emmanuel Macron broke with his family and with his hometown. He and Brigitte took on the world. It remains an indestructible union. The current president of France does not have great friends or confidants: Brigitte is enough for him. Without Brigitte, Macron cannot be understood.\n\nSeveral people who know Macron (as far as it is possible to know someone who is essentially hermetic) agree that he is a man who lives out his life as a fictional character, in search of increasingly sensational challenges and adventures. That craving is likely related to the taboo that was broken in 1992.\n\n“I think he would have liked to be a writer or an actor, and he applies his dramatic talent to politics as well as to his own life,” says Gaspard Gantzer, who was his classmate at the National School of Administration and then at the Elysée Palace: Macron was an adviser to president François Hollande, Gantzer was the press officer.\n\nMacron is a seducer capable of charming almost anyone. He sleeps very little, his memory is extraordinary and his capacity for work almost unlimited. “We are talking about a very, very brilliant man,” says Manuel Valls, France’s prime minister when Macron was economy minister.\n\n“He knows how to be cold when it suits him and he maintains his cool at all times, but he tends to take a positive approach to things and is capable of being very thoughtful and caring,” says Gantzer. All the people consulted agree in underlining two virtues of Macron: physical courage, which has more than once made him face hostile crowds (and get out of it thanks to his charm), and audacity. He was a good corporate banker at Rothschild. In that job, he learned to take risks and jump at any opportunity.\n\n"Where others see charm and friendliness, I have failed to see anything other than superficiality and narcissism," says a conservative politician who prefers not to be quoted.\n\nThe traitor\n\nEmmanuel Macron is haunted by the shadow of Eugène de Rastignac, the most famous social climber in French literature. Rastignac appears in several novels by Honoré de Balzac: he is a hustler who prospers in finances thanks to his lover’s husband; he marries his lover’s daughter and achieves a good position in Parisian society. “All politicians have something of Rastignac,” concedes Manuel Valls. “And the French system favors personality-driven ventures.”\n\nMacron, during his campaign trip to Marseille, on April 16. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nValls, who after serving as French prime minister later became a city councilor in Barcelona (he is a dual Spanish-French citizen), was one of the victims of the great conspiracy developed by Macron from inside the Élysée. He had fierce clashes with his economy minister and went to great lengths to convince then-president François Hollande to remove Macron from the palace. It was useless: Hollande fell under Macron’s spell until “the methodical betrayal” of his protégé, in Hollande’s own words, became evident. It was already too late.\n\nLe traître et le néant (or The traitor and the void), the book on Emmanuel Macron written by journalists Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme, confirms over and over again that Emmanuel Macron’s ability to fascinate is multiplied with older men and greater power. As soon as he left the National School of Administration, Macron successfully sought the protection of the most powerful men of the Republic: Jacques Attali and Alain Minc, two president-makers. It was Minc who procured him a job at the Rothschild Bank, so that he could amass wealth before devoting himself to politics. And it was Attali who brought him close to the Socialist Party and François Hollande.\n\nDuring Hollande’s presidency, first as an adviser and then as a minister, Emmanuel Macron played his own game. Luck helped him, as always: the strokes of fortune of the current president of France are legendary. When he was about to leave the Élysée for a well-paid teaching position, for example, a stroke of luck led him to the Ministry of Economy. In addition to luck, boldness and an amazing ability to deceive also played a role.\n\nMacron used all the resources of the ministry to weave a dense network of contacts. During his last eight months in office, Macron spent €120,000 on dinners held at the ministerial residence, an imposing glass-enclosed apartment facing the Seine. Some nights there were two dinner shifts with different diners. And a third shift was added at La Rotonde, the Macrons’ favorite brasserie.\n\nMacron was creating En Marche! (the name was chosen by Brigitte because she liked it and the initials coincided with those of her husband) and he repeatedly assured Hollande that it was a political club intended to support his re-election. Instead, together with a group of moderate socialists who felt orphaned by the fall of long-time party heavyweight Dominique Strauss-Kahn (the fall from grace of DSK after being accused of rape was one of Macron’s lucky breaks), Macron was in fact boycotting Hollande and actually preparing his own race for the presidency. The documents were burned in a stove. There was absolute secrecy.\n\nMacron destroyed the options of Hollande and Valls from within. Finally, he announced that he was not a socialist, forced his own dismissal and embarked on the campaign to become president of France.\n\nThe politician\n\nLike a corporate banker, Emmanuel Macron launched a takeover bid (after long secret preparations) for the Socialist Party. The initial core of En Marche! was made up of socialists disappointed by François Hollande, the president who wanted to be “normal” and ended up being irrelevant. Once the main party on the left had been dismantled, he captured very prominent figures from The Republicans, the great Gaullist party on the right. “He was the first to guess that the classic parties had collapsed, that the system was in a state of crisis,” says Manuel Valls.\n\nPerhaps Macron’s first presidential adventure would have failed if Alain Juppé had won the primaries of The Republicans. But François Fillon prevailed, a candidate whose campaign frayed when it was discovered that his wife received a salary without working and that he was irregularly financing his high lifestyle. Another stroke of luck: big banking and big industry abandoned Fillon and turned to Macron.\n\n“There is something Napoleonic in Macron’s brilliant career, he knew how to take risks at the right time and people followed him,” summarizes Valls, who in recent times has gotten closer to his old enemy. As soon as he found out that his rival in the second round would be far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, Macron already felt like a president. And he held a big party at La Rotonde, which was premature according to some and inappropriate according to others, because back then it was considered a disgrace for the far right to even reach the second round of voting.\n\nNobody considers that Macron’s five-year term has been a success. Macron has shown that he knows a lot about France, but very little about the French. La République en Marche, the presidential version of En Marche!, is not a party, but rather a group of clappers dazzled by their leader. The absence of internal criticism, the small role played by members of the government (with the exception of the economy minister, the conservative Bruno Le Maire) and the character of Macron have turned the presidency into a one-man affair.\n\nMacron, the candidate “of the right and of the left,” is a right-wing president. “He has developed a system of government that is too vertical, he has not been able to create a true center party and he has not been able to reach consensus and state pacts,” criticizes Manuel Valls.\n\nThe prosperous and urban France brought Macron to the Elysee. Macron made the mistake of governing for that France alone, and not for the other one that is rural, poorly paid and depends on diesel and subsidies. He insisted on underestimating the revolt of the “yellow vests,” with whom his prime minister, the conservative Édouard Philippe, rejected any negotiation. The president put an end to the crisis by taking to the streets in person to hold large public debates that lasted entire days.\n\nMacron, along with his wife, Brigitte, inside Nanterre stadium, on the outskirts of Paris, on April 2. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nHe was unable to enjoy his success. The pandemic emerged and the liberal economic policy was transformed into a policy of massive subsidies. Now, inflation and war have accentuated the exceptionality. The mysterious phrase issued by Jacques Attali, his great mentor, will always float over the politics of Emmanuel Macron: “Macron embodies nothingness.”\n\nThe philosopher\n\nEmmanuel Macron relentlessly feeds his aura as a president-philosopher, as a romantic intellectual who cannot end the day without reading some of René Char’s poems or immersing himself in a metaphysical treatise. There is, however, a flaw in the character. Macron was twice rejected at the École Normale Supérieure (Normal Sup), the true Olympus of the humanities in France. He had to settle for studying philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, where admission is much easier. It is true that the double rejection occurred at a stormy time, when the young Emmanuel and Brigitte had just broken ties with their past and taken refuge in Paris.\n\n"Perhaps the legend of Macron as a great intellectual has been exaggerated, and perhaps he has done his best to exaggerate that legend," says one of France\'s most renowned philosophers, a man who participated in some of the Bercy dinners and prefers not to be cited. "I see him more as a great technocrat, banker and high official, with a sensitivity to culture and humanistic concerns, but with a relatively superficial philosophical knowledge."\n\nGaspard Gantzer insists that Macron sees himself as a writer. A writer without any written work, in any case. The current president often speaks of the influence exerted on him by Paul Ricoeur, the great figure of French phenomenology, a unanimously respected humanist and socialist philosopher. “It was Ricoeur who pushed me into politics,” he once said.\n\nMacron helped Ricoeur as an editorial assistant on his latest and best-known work, Memory, History, Forgetting. Basically, he looked for documentation and wrote up the bibliographic records. He took advantage of his relationship with Ricoeur to get on the editorial board of Esprit, the best-known French journal on philosophy, and publish a few articles with very little impact.\n\nThe current president graduated in philosophy (he is also a finance inspector) with a thesis on Machiavelli, whose work he has not stopped reading. The “Jupiterian” tone of his presidency, in the most majestic sense of the term, and his predilection for results, rather than for theories and principles, are possibly related to his Machiavellian studies.\n\n“They say that Macron exercises power as an enlightened despot, which has its logic, because enlightened despotism is the system that is usually associated with the prince-philosopher,” said Francis Wolff, a professor emeritus of philosophy at Normal Sup and a world authority on Aristotle, in statements to the authors of The traitor and the void.\n\nThere is almost unanimous agreement in his close circle about Macron’s talent when it comes to reciting poetry. He has memorized thousands of verses, his delivery is strong and he uses the resources of an actor. If necessary, he can also sit down at the piano: he studied it for 10 years. On the whole, he has a much higher cultural veneer than is usual among heads of state and government. And he loves for people to notice it.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/KRW02FqOeEcLxlEDFjjIV-lyGF8=/1200x0/filters:focal(584x435:594x445)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/A4TNZCX3AVHXZPJVY7QFQO6ZHQ.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:09'}

Le Pen\'s result this time around was the best ever for the far right.\n\nMacron acknowledged some of the challenges he now faces in his victory speech Sunday night in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\n“Our country is beset by doubts and divisions,” he said. “Today’s vote requires us to consider all the hardships of people’s lives and to respond effectively to them and to the anger expressed.”\n\nThe French president has a long to-do list, ranging from preparing for key parliamentary elections in June to implementing his long-delayed pension reform plans and dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron also has to contend with an energised far left, many of whom backed far-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round and voted for the incumbent in the final round only to stop a far-right victory.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. Mélenchon’s France is not reconcilable with Le Pen’s, he said.

But she made clear she still had political ambitions.\n\nLe Pen said on Sunday she would "never abandon" the French and declared that she had scored a "brilliant victory" in her defeat.\n\nFor the upcoming parliamentary elections, her party has not formed an alliance with that of far-right rival Éric Zemmour, who scored 7 percent in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nSenior Le Pen aide Jean-Philippe Tanguy said Monday that Zemmour would have to acknowledge that she was the leader of the opposition.\n\nFrench parties look to win seats in June parliamentary election 01:40\n\nRelief among allies\n\nMacron will now try to implement his vision of more pro-business reforms and tighter EU integration after a first term overshadowed by protests, then the coronavirus pandemic and finally Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron\'s re-election sparked relief across Europe, where he has been seen as a guarantor of continuity.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news", European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said she was "delighted" and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters had "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nUS President Joe Biden, Canada\'s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Australian premier Scott Morrison also welcomed his win.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin – whom Macron had unsuccessfully sought to persuade to end the invasion of Ukraine – said Monday he wished the French president "success in your state activities, as well as good health and well-being".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Macron "a true friend of Ukraine".\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/07fd6986-c525-11ec-9a8a-005056bf8594/w:1280/p:16x9/macron-emotion.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:55'}

Its main policies of lowering the retirement age to 60 years, raising the minimum wage, price freezes and the ushering in of a “Sixth Republic” are not negotiable.\n\nLFI also wants its own candidates to be allowed to run in the number of constituencies that is proportional to its vote share in the presidentials. Then there’s a tricky question of how bound the coalition would be to European treaties.\n\nA handful of those are at odds with Mélenchon’s policy platform, which he says he wants to implement even if it means breaking EU rules.\n\nEuropean MP Yannick Jadot, who came third in the presidentials on the Europe-Ecologie Les Verts (EELV) greens party ticket, wants France to move towards more European integration.\n\nUnnamed EELV sources told BMFTV that Mélenchon’s demands were too great and risked “erasing” the platforms of other leftist parties altogether.\n\nJadot himself told France Inter radio on Tuesday that he was broadly in favour of a left-wing coalition, but not with Mélenchon as its leader.\n\n"We have such a responsibility on the climate," he said – adding the left needed a “very open" coalition that respected "the diversity and identity of its partners”.\n\nEELV’s own internal divisions – notably between Jadot and the party\'s national secretary Julien Bayou – may also prove a stumbling block to any future alliance.\n\nThe latter has conceded that time is running out and “the dice must be thrown this week” on the matter.\n\n.@yjadot : "Je soutiens la perspective d\'une coalition, qui doit être une coalition très ouverte.

Despite the paltry 1.75 percent of the vote managed by presidential hopeful Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists still enjoy a well-established local power base, with 28 lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nA representative of the Communist Party (PCF) told BFMTV that the “disrespectful” number of constituencies offered to them meant the jury was still out on their involvement in a possible coalition.\n\n"There is still too much uncertainty to say whether the Communists will accept this agreement or slam the door," the PCF member said.\n\nElsewhere, LFI is also in talks with the New Anti-Capitalist Party, which has responded favourably and has been openly pushing LFI’s notion that the June polls represent a "third round” of the presidential contest.\n\nAll 577 deputy seats in the lower house will be up for grabs on 12 and 19 June, with LREM likely to meet stiff resistance.

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us. Tonight we tell them that we will continue to transform Europe by their side”, she added.\n\nWhile Macron received many congratulations from his European counterparts, he acknowledged his victory was not as self-evident as last time.\n\n“Many of our compatriots voted for me, not to support the ideas I put forward, but to block the extreme right”, he told the crowd, thanking them and committing to address these divisions.\n\n“Our challenge is to restore French unity. The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

At the same time, most age groups were split more evenly between Macron and Le Pen; the only group that went all out for the incumbent president were the 18-to-24-year-olds. Yes, Generation Z, the post-millennials, saved Macron. And not so much because of their outpouring love for the president, but out of their fear of the alternative.\n\nThe French presidential election system was set up this way by President Charles de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic. The two-round system (no one gets 51% of the votes in the first round) often forces a second-round competition between a centrist and an extremist candidate, and the majority always prefers the centrist. Next, France will have a parliamentary election and the reelected Macron will campaign for the voters to give his party the majority so that his premiere would be from his own party and not, embarrassingly, from the opposition. He’ll get that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo, how come, on Monday morning, the euro fell 0.34% against the dollar, to $1.07725, close to its two-year low last week? Reuters suggested investors may be relieved to see that Le Pen is not in office, but this doesn’t mean they have high expectations of the winner. Still, the nationalist Le Pen promised to nationalize some key parts of France’s industry, cut taxes radically, and curtail France’s participation in the EU budget. The nightmare is over, investors, what’s holding y’all back?\n\nTurns out the future of the world’s economy is mired in anxiety: US stocks are not performing; futures are declining; China is being revisited by the pandemic it may have invented, so large chunks of its workforce are under lockdowns; supply chains are getting bogged down even worse than before; and Putin continues to try to salvage some measure of victory over Ukraine in time for May 9, the anniversary of the Red Army’s victory over the Nazis.\n\nThe dollar roared over in Israel, too, where it struck NIS 3.27 for the first time in who knows how long. It has probably more to do with the Fed raising interest rates recently than with French politics, but it couldn’t come at a better time, when Israel is struggling to retool its economy and restart its lavish exports again.\n\nMost French Jews heaved a sigh of relief over Macron’s win, especially Orthodox Jews – who would normally align with the right-wing candidate. The reason is that Le Pen, despite her cosmetic efforts, is more an old-fashion fascist than a modern-day extreme right-winger. As part of her fierce anti-immigration (some say xenophobic) policy, she promised to ban animal slaughter without stunning, insisting that stunning the animal is more humane. Of course, stunning renders the animal as “traif” for both Jews and Muslims, who threatened that they would leave France if they were deprived of their kosher and halal meat (If Le Pen Wins, She’ll Ban Kosher Shechita in France).\n\nAnd since France exports kosher meat, a ban on its production in France would have had a devastating impact on Jewish communities elsewhere, most notably in neighboring Switzerland.\n\nMany right-wing Israelis didn’t see a big distinction between Macron and Le Pen because both support the two-state solution and a Palestinian state. But if that’s your litmus test, then most Western and Third-World countries should be classified as anti-Israel. I thought Macron stood out as a friend a couple of weeks ago, when he clashed with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, calling him a “far-right antisemite.” So Emanuel can’t be all bad.\n\nHere’s what happened: Morawiecki compared the French president’s phone calls with Vladimir Putin to negotiating with Hitler. Now, you may support Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine or be against them, but they just don’t compare with what Hitler did to most of Europe and the rest of the planet. In response, Macron told Le Parisien that Morawiecki was trying to help Le Pen, and called him a “far-right antisemite who bans LGBT persons” in his country.\n\nA spokesman for Morawiecki said it was a lie and the Polish PM wasn’t an antisemite. But he kind of is. In 2018 he said Jews were involved in perpetrating the Holocaust (which would have been a brilliant solution to the supply chain problems). And Morawiecki is also behind the Polish law that punishes anyone who blames Poles for taking part in the Nazi Holocaust crimes.\n\nAnd, in June 2021, after Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called the new Polish law barring Jews from filing Holocaust restitution claims in Poland “immoral,” PM Morawiecki said, “I can only say that as long as I am the prime minister, Poland will not pay for German crimes: Neither zloty, nor euro, nor dollar.”\n\nSee? It always comes down to economics.

The centre has held. Yesterday (24 April), 2022 stopped being 2022 just long enough for Emmanuel Macron to see off Marine Le Pen and secure re-election as the president of France. The result came as a great relief to millions around the world.\n\n\n\nMany are tempted to try and read into the result some grander narrative in which Europe remains a sort of liberal Hyperborea, a paradise from which the British expelled themselves in 2016 (together with Americans in electing Donald Trump). On closer inspection, however, this conception doesn’t quite square with the bald reality: the Rassemblement National (RN), a party explicitly rooted in the post-fascist far right, has just taken 41 per cent of the second-round vote in one of the European Union’s most important member states.\n\nAdmirers in Britain have long been prepared to overlook the unfortunate truth that France is home to one of the world’s largest white far-right parties. While Macron might have won yesterday’s election, the trend of the far right is only upward in France. Back in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, first broke through to contest the second round of the presidential election, French voters united around Jacques Chirac and rejected the Front National (as the RN was known at the time) by more than four to one. The elder Le Pen took less than 18 per cent of the second-round vote. Yet in 2017, his daughter Marine won more than 33 per cent – and yesterday, she won 41 per cent. Furthermore, while in Britain even the respectable right has serious trouble wooing younger voters, polling by YouGov has suggested that in France the RN is ahead with voters aged 18-24, as well as winning voters directly from the far left.\n\nFrance is not the only EU country to display this trend, however: there are plenty of other correctives for anyone who, despairing of the UK’s current government, might pine for a lost Eden across the English Channel. Across southern Europe the long political legacy of the EU’s tough response to the financial crisis plays out in the rise of right-wing parties that, like the RN, harbour more or less explicit links to historical anti-democratic movements. Italy not only contains the populist party Lega Nord but its smaller ally Fratelli d’Italia, whose logo features the familiar tricoloured flame of the postwar far right.\n\nRelated\n\nIn Spain meanwhile, Vox, a party with Francoist undertones, has outflanked Madrid’s traditional parties of the right on the question of Spanish unity, and secured its first beachhead in government. In eastern Europe, there is the organised, multinational challenge of the Visegrád Group; while in wealthy northern Europe, the social democratic Danish government recently adopted what Foreign Policy called “one of the harshest refugee policies in the world”.\n\nIn contrast, despite the performative toughness of the Rwanda proposals, the United Kingdom operates what the statistics show to be a pretty liberal immigration regime. Whatever its flaws, no sober observer can conflate the Conservative Party with the far-right movements gaining ground on the continent.\n\nNone of this is proof that Brexit was a good idea, of course, nor that France and Europe are not home to real liberal achievements. But we should accept that a country in which Le Pen takes 40 per cent of the vote is no nirvana.', 'image': 'https://www.newstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1236459286-1038x778.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:50'}

Faced with the prospect of a far-right takeover of the Élysée, a sufficient number of voters put aside their reservations regarding Emmanuel Macron and made him the first president to win a second term in office for 20 years. In the end, Mr Macron’s 58%-42% victory over Marine Le Pen was much more comfortable than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when some polls predicted a knife-edge contest.\n\nFor France – and the rest of Europe – the alternative outcome would have been disastrous and destabilising. Ms Le Pen’s authoritarian, nationalist and xenophobic vision would have led to civil strife domestically and undermined solidarity between western democracies at a vital time. That Mr Macron successfully averted this worst-case scenario is a cause for celebration. But as his victory speech on Sunday night tacitly acknowledged, an election won with the help of the fear factor has delivered an exceptionally fragile mandate. Describing France as riven by doubt and division, Mr Macron pledged to be “not the candidate of one camp, but the president of all of us”. Such assurances are commonplace from victorious political leaders, but it is vital that Mr Macron makes good on them during a second term, which looks challenging to say the least.\n\nAs the election laid bare, France is dangerously divided along economic and generational fault lines. A majority of blue-collar workers – and more than four in 10 voters overall – opted for Ms Le Pen. This, the best score in the history of the French far right, allowed Ms Le Pen to declare her share of the vote a “victory in itself”. Disturbingly, it indicates that the normalisation of her movement is all but complete. Mr Macron’s core vote, by contrast, came from wealthy business people, middle-class professionals and retired people. Younger, well educated but economically precarious voters who supported the radical left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round were left without a dog in the fight.\n\nReflecting widespread disillusionment with the choice on offer, particularly among the young, the rate of abstention was the highest for a presidential runoff since 1969. Among potential voters under the age of 25, more than 40% failed to cast a ballot. Enough voters on the left lent their support to Mr Macron to keep the far right out of power, but in fewer numbers than in 2017. Hostilities on the right and the left will now be resumed ahead of parliamentary elections in June.\n\nIf he is to successfully navigate this volatile political landscape, Mr Macron will need to adopt a radically different playbook from the one that characterised his first five years in the Élysée. During that time, he acquired a reputation as the “president of the rich” after watering down a wealth tax, pursuing unpopular pension reforms and imposing a fuel tax that sparked the gilets jaunes movement. An autocratic style contributed to the widespread impression that Mr Macron’s declared intention to transform and liberalise the French economy would be accomplished at the expense of the less well-off.\n\nTo make good on his aspirations to reach out across the divides, Mr Macron will need to do far more to address such concerns and insecurities. During a campaign that became unexpectedly close, there were signs that this was being recognised. In an encouraging early statement of intent, it has already been signalled that there will be full consultation with unions and other bodies over proposals to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, in a still fragile post-Covid economy, Mr Macron should also recognise that more needs to be done to protect and improve the living standards of blue-collar workers and the youthful precariat, which voted en masse for Mr Mélenchon. As he contemplates five more years in office, Mr Macron must realise that he has been given not so much a mandate as another chance.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f9dc305d6b01ad6e862da6d17afc1f0e1d372f/0_0_4625_2774/master/4625.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4f9959a701f15dfce678c4ac1137a3cd', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:42'}

But this flattering score falls to 38.52% of the electorate, i.e. the registered voters. In other words, nearly two thirds of the French did not vote Macron.

Here is France cut into small pieces, like a puzzle. If it is true that the first round revealed the tri-polarization of French political life, the second round shows us a France of the elites against a France of the people, a France of the big cities against a France of the rural areas, a France of the “bobos”, happy and rich, and a France of the eternally forgotten, of the poor (there are 10 million of them) who can neither find decent housing, nor heat, nor food, nor entertainment.\n\nIn these conditions, how can one be the president “of all the French”?

Berlin has not only hit the brakes when it comes to EU sanctions, but its refusal to supply heavy weapons to Ukraine has also reduced its leadership potential.\n\n“I think Germany has to be content now with playing at best the second, maybe even the third role in Europe. And that, of course, is partly due to the dithering and hesitation of Chancellor Olaf Scholz,” Vöpel said.\n\nAt the same time, the war has also exposed the weaknesses of its policies of the last few decades that concern Russia.\n\nWhile France always warned against too much economic dependence on Russia – especially concerning the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – Germany’s Russia policy was driven by the attempt to bring Russia closer to the West through closer economic integration. This approach has largely failed, considering Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Germany is also much more isolated than France in other areas. Macron, for example, has sought a close alliance with his Italian counterpart, Mario Draghi, on reforming European debt rules.\n\n“Particularly in the face of the current crises, Macron will try to work with Draghi to push for increased financial leeway to be able to shoulder the necessary investments,” emphasised Vöpel.\n\nAlthough Germany, in particular, has been hesitant to support the reform and the loosening of the EU’s fiscal rules, the balance of power in Europe has shifted toward the reform of rules, he added.\n\nGerman position in the EU\n\nHowever, Germany’s positions now coincide with Macron’s visions in many areas, most notably the attempt to foster European sovereignty.\n\nWhile Macron’s calls for a sovereign Europe in his keynote speech at the Sorbonne in 2017 were mainly left unanswered by the German government, the issue is now also topping the agenda in Germany. Scholz’s Zeitenwende is already profoundly anchored in German discourse and goes beyond the Ukraine war’s immediate effects.\n\nLast Wednesday, for example, Finance Minister Christian Lindner called for a complete strategic reset of German policy.\n\n“We have placed ourselves at a triple risk. We have become too dependent when it comes to energy from Russia, security from the U.S. and business with China,” Lindner told Focus Online. As a result, he said, Germany must now “re-found its business model.”\n\nGerman SPD MEP Udo Bullmann also stressed to EURACTIV that it was now necessary to strengthen European sovereignty.\n\nWhat is needed now is “a European policy full of self-confidence, but also full of clear objectives of peacekeeping, the international role of the European Union, and a new economic and development model in the face of climate change,” Bullmann said.\n\nMeanwhile, CEP Paris Director Marc Uzan also expressed confidence in the German ability to change.\n\n“Germany is at a turning point, and I think Berlin will be up to the challenge,” he told EURACTIV.\n\nAccording to him, France could also play a key role for Germany in this political upheaval.\n\n“Marcon could be the bridge to help Germany change its growth model and maybe its geopolitical model too,” Uzan stressed.\n\n[Edited by Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57538786-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

The future of Europe lies in our hands. Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his victory!”.\n\nThe opposition tried to link Le Pen’s defeat to the Polish conservative PiS government, which has clashed with Brussels over the rule of law. During the migration crisis with Belarus, Macron had told the Polish prime minister that the EU would stand by them but would not overlook the rule of law concerns.\n\n“A day will come that we will have Paris in Warsaw”, opposition centrist leader Donald Tusk (Civic Platform) said.\n\nThe topic of Russia was very present in politicians’ reactions.\n\n“Thanks to Macron’s victory, there will be more Europe in Europe […] And less Russia”, Tusk added.\n\nCentre-right lawmaker Jarosław Gowin (Porozumienie party) said Macron saved France from the pro-Putin Le Pen while the “hopes of PiS leaders to build a strong Eurosceptic bloc are dashed. The next congress of the leaders of the populist right will be a congress of losers.”\n\n“A victory for Marine Le Pen would be a victory for the vision of a Europe of selfish states, of which the Kremlin would be most happy,” commented Władysław Kosiniak – Kamysz, a lawmaker for the centrist/agrarian Polish People’s Party.\n\n“France and Europe defended by Emmanuel Macron against hatred, backwardness, and Putin,” tweeted Maciej Gdula, a social-democratic lawmaker from the New Left.\n\nIn Prague, which will soon take over from France the EU Council rotating presidency, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala (ODS, ECR) said France is a “vital partner”, while Czech Parliament’s speaker Markéta Pekarová Adamová (TOP 09, EPP) said populism and nationalism have lost and that France will continue to be a partner in the EU and NATO.\n\nIn Slovakia, Defence Minister Jaroslav Naď (OĽaNO) stated Macron’s re-election is “excellent news for whole democratic world”, stressing the clear stance of Macron towards Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nIn Hungary, so far, there has been no official government reaction.\n\nEuropean federalist MEP Dobrev Klára from Democratic Coalition (DK) hailed Macron’s victory, while “Viktor Orban’s ally and friend in the region, Janez Janša, and his populist right-wing Slovenian Democratic Party lost the elections […] Both is great news for Europe’s friends”.\n\nThe German message\n\n“Your voters have also sent a strong message of commitment to Europe today,” German chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Twitter. During this election, finance minister Christian Lindner added that France was standing at the crossroads, stressing that “the united Europe is the biggest winner of this election.”\n\nHowever, the strong result of Le Pen has prompted concern. Ahead of Macron now lies the task of “rallying the French people, who voted strongly for right-wing and left-wing populists in this round of elections, probably out of disappointment, behind the political centre again,” Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesperson of the conservative CDU told EURACTIV.\n\nThe result is a “serious reminder” to the French president that “France now needs a social and ecological renewal” as France is facing “deep social divides,” a senior Social Democrat, MEP Udo Bullmann, told EURACTIV.\n\n“Emmanuel Macron’s election victory was more important for Europe than the German federal election. France has voted against right-wing populism and resentment and favoured President Macron’s Europe,” chancellor candidate for the CDU/CSU in 2021, Armin Laschet, told EURACTIV.\n\nAustrian and Dutch leaders also focused on the pro-EU signal of Macron’s victory.\n\nIn Rome, Madrid, Lisbon and Athens, leaders highlighted France’s commitment to the European project.\n\nIn Italy, Lega leader Matteo Salvini congratulated Le Pen, tweeting: “Congratulations, Marine! Alone against everyone, coherent and smiling, you have gathered the vote of 13 million French people, an unprecedented rate. Together for a Europe based on work, family, security, rights and freedom”.\n\nGreek MEP Stelios Kouloglou told EURACTIV that all polls show that disadvantaged French people support the far-right candidate as they feel marginalised by the political and social system. “Far-right demagogues are all over Europe are waiting if the problems of the vast majority are not solved.”\n\n“Five years is very little in history. In France, the next match may have very unpleasant surprises. For now, France and the EU are saved. But until when?” he wondered.', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/main-lead-800x450.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:27'}

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

Police used tear gas to disperse gatherings in Paris and the western city of Rennes.\n\n- New era -\n\nIn a victory speech on the Champ de Mars in central Paris at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, Macron vowed to respond to the anger of voters who backed his far-right rival, saying his new term would not continue unchanged from the last five years.\n\n"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right," he told thousands of cheering supporters.\n\n"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me."\n\nHe also pledged a "renewed method" to govern France, adding that this "new era" would not be one of "continuity with the last term which is now ending".\n\nIn a combative speech to supporters in Paris in which she accepted the result but showed no sign of quitting politics, Le Pen, 53, said she would "never abandon" the French and was already preparing for the June legislative elections.\n\n"The result represents a brilliant victory," she said to cheers.\n\n"This evening, we launched the great battle for the legislative elections," Le Pen said, adding that she felt "hope" and calling on opponents of the president to join with her National Rally (RN) party.\n\n- \'Count on France\' -\n\nThe result is narrower than the second-round clash in 2017, when the same two candidates met in the run-off and Macron polled over 66 percent of the vote.\n\nFor Le Pen, her third defeat in presidential polls will be a bitter pill to swallow after she plowed years of effort into making herself electable and distancing her party from the legacy of its founder, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nCritics insisted her party never stopped being extreme-right and racist while Macron repeatedly pointed to her plan to ban the wearing of the Muslim headscarf in public if elected.\n\nThe projections caused immense relief in Europe after fears a Le Pen presidency would leave the continent rudderless following Brexit and the departure from politics of German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news for all of Europe" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nEU president Charles Michel said the bloc could now "count on France for five more years" while Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also congratulated him, saying she was "delighted to be able to continue our excellent cooperation".\n\nIn another election Sunday, Slovenia\'s three-time Prime Minister Janez Jansa, criticized by opponents as an authoritarian right-wing populist, was at risk of losing power to a party led by political newcomer Robert Golob.\n\n- \'Ocean of abstention\' -\n\nMacron will be hoping for a less complicated second term that will allow him to implement his vision of more pro-business reform and tighter EU integration, after a first term shadowed by protests, then the pandemic and finally Russia\'s military operation in Ukraine.\n\nBut he will have to win over those who backed his opponents and the millions of French who did not bother to vote.\n\nPolling organizations estimated turnout of just 72 percent, the lowest in any presidential election second-round run-off since 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, according to partial results, 6.45 percent of voters in the election voted for neither candidate in blank ballots while 2.35 percent spoilt their papers.\n\nThe hard-left third-placed candidate in the first round, Jean-Luc Melenchon, had refused to endorse Macron.\n\nHe has his eyes firmly set on the June elections.\n\nMelenchon welcomed Le Pen\'s defeat as "very good news for the unity of our people" but said Le Pen and Macron had barely managed to win a third of support from registered voters.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots", he said.', 'image': 'https://cdnimgen.royanews.tv/imageserv/Size728Q40/news/20220425/35368.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:44'}

And so do U.S. voters in general, not just Republicans. Nearly 60 percent of those who participated in a recent Gallup poll said there was too much immigration into the country. That makes anti-immigrant sentiment mainstream. Le Pen\'s platform also proposed that non-citizen immigrants arrested for any crime be sent back to their country of origin. This fringe position in France is the law of the land in America and has been for years.\n\n"They\'re bringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime. They\'re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," Donald Trump said on the day in 2015 that he announced he was running for president. During his tenure in office, Trump took many different steps to limit immigration, and not just the illegal sort. In fact, in 2020, he reduced the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. by 49 percent.\n\nWhat puts Le Pen and the National Rally Party in the far-right corner of politics, then? Like her near-fascist father before her, Le Pen isn\'t fond of immigrants, and I mean really not fond . She wants them to assimilate to French culture to the point where they would be indistinguishable from France\'s original immigrants (or rather, invaders), the Germanic Franks, who came for a visit to the Roman Empire in the 4th century and never went away. But even more than assimilating, Le Pen and her party would much rather immigrants just go back to where they came from.\n\nAnalysts all over the world woke up on Monday morning to mourn the fact that far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen wasn\'t beaten soundly enough, even though she lost by more than 16 points to a man few people in France apparently love , the incumbent Emmanuel Macron.\n\nNational Rally is also famously skeptical of international alliances, especially those with NATO and the European Union. France is one of the founding members of the EU, and along with Germany, forms its heart. For France to leave the Union would gut it, and possibly bring an end to the "European project" of peace and economic cooperation for the continent. But such actions don\'t send a shudder down the spine of Americans; Trump for his part killed a major trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, threatened to undo America\'s free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, pulled out of the Paris climate treaty, and came closer than we ever knew to essentially pulling the U.S. out of NATO — all to the applause of many Republicans.\n\nTrump was not standing out in the cold on the issue of NATO, either. Before the war in Ukraine, only 48 percent of Americans thought the organization was doing a good job, and a full 65 percent of Republicans thought it was doing a poor job. If France is the heart of the EU, the U.S. simply is NATO. The U.S. founded the alliance and provides a shield for the other members that fall under the American aegis. This may change, thanks Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s war in Ukraine, which has forced Europe to rethink its role in its own defense, but as of right now, U.S. leadership is clear and unquestioned.\n\nAnd speaking of the war in Ukraine and Russia in general, Le Pen and Trump share something else: A love for Putin. Over and over, Trump praised Putin for his intelligence, strength, and the high quality of his negotiating tactics. He even asked for Russia to help him get dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, which is widely believed to have been tainted by Russian interference, both online and off. Le Pen is also deeply tied to Putin, speaking warmly of the autocrat while her National Rally happily took Russian money. She has praised Putin\'s nationalism and skepticism of globalization.\n\nLe Pen\'s economic policies are not a one-to-one correlation with those in the GOP — this is France after all, so some "socialism" on health care and other issues are required — but the fear of corporate globalism is exactly the same. Trump\'s "America First" economics fit very well with Le Pen\'s ideas.\n\nOn social issues, National Rally had to moderate several positions to become competitive in France. Gay marriage and abortion play their part in the political process over there, just as they do here, and Le Pen had to loosen up. The difference here is that America\'s far-right is succeeding in protecting the "traditional values" of the Dark Ages.\n\nSo could Le Pen be elected in America? No, she\'s a foreigner. But as far as her positions go, there\'s very little to bar a politician like her. We\'ve already voted for people on the local and national levels who make Le Pen practically look like a liberal. Even her position that Muslims should not be allowed to wear headscarves in public places, while extreme, falls in line with overall American feelings about Muslims.\n\nEven now, as President Biden is being praised elsewhere in the world for rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and reaffirming America\'s commitment to NATO, there are viable presidential candidates waiting in the wings to undo that work. And even if they don\'t win in 2024, chances are they\'ll be a lot closer to the White House than 16 points behind.', 'image': 'https://mediacloud.theweek.com/image/upload/s--X-WVjvBW--/f_auto,t_content-image-full-desktop@1/v1650910407/Trump le pen.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

These are set to alter further the balance of power between the Socialists and the Republicains who have already imploded and are struggling to survive.\n\nInstead, the main opponents of Macron’s liberal, centrist La République En Marche are Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s far-left La France Insoumise and Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement national.\n\nWhat are the possible scenarios?\n\nAn “unlikely” far-right or far-left majority\n\nAccording to Thanassis Diamantopoulos, professor of political science at the University of Athens and expert on the French regime, the hypothesis of a far-right or far-left majority in the National Assembly is “unlikely”, despite the historically high scores of Le Pen and Mélenchon’s parties.\n\nIn France, the two-round majoritarian single-member electoral system means that “even with a majority, the far right and far left cannot win parliamentary elections. […] They have no potential to form an alliance”, and it is easier for “the forces around the centre to form an alliance”, Diamantopoulos told EURACTIV France.\n\nBut in recent days, Mélenchon has unequivocally called on his supporters: “I ask you to elect me Prime minister”.\n\nBetween the fact that “there will be no defections” in favour of Mélenchon’s party and the “under-representation of the extremes”, the possibility that his appeal will become a reality in the ballot box remains dim.\n\nAnother element that works against the most radical parties is that “there are two ‘anti-system’ expressions, one on the far right and the other on the left”.\n\nFor these reasons, eight deputies were elected under the banner of the Rassemblement National in 2017, despite qualifying for the second round of the presidential election, and Mélenchon’s party had seventeen. These results are far below the overall results at the national level.\n\nThe (new) attempt to unite the left\n\nOn the left, the urgent need for unity is being felt both by executives and voters, in order to regain influence and hope to impose a social and ecological majority on Macron.\n\nContacted by EURACTIV France, Sylvie Guillaume, a Socialist MEP, said she hoped that “the legislative elections [will make it possible to] restore a better balance because the presidential election is not a blank check” for the newly re-elected president.\n\nThe same is true of the Insoumis — Mélenchon’s supporters — who want to believe in uniting the left.\n\nMEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV France that her movement “appeals to those who do not feel represented” and admits to being in discussion with the other left-wing forces, to agree on “a common base”.\n\nThe call of Mélenchon and his supporters seem to have been heard by the other left-wing movements. Europe Ecologie Les Verts MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV France that “the political forces of the left and the ecologists must organise themselves to weigh together if they do not want to condemn themselves to lose separately”.\n\nLéon Deffontaines, president of the young communists’ movement, told EURACTIV France he hoped to see “the ideas of equality, sharing and solidarity become the majority again”.\n\nCommunist candidate Fabien Roussel pleaded on Sunday evening for a “global agreement” of the left, demanding that “local anchors and different sensibilities on the left be taken into account” in order to avoid the distribution benefiting only La France Insoumise, which largely dominated the left in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nYet, according to Diamantopoulos, even if “some constituencies [the left] could get some MPs elected” the idea of “getting close to a parliamentary majority is a political fiction”.\n\nWhat majority for Macron?\n\nDespite the parliamentary challenges, Macron will not throw in the towel.\n\nJudging by the comments of Gabriel Attal, spokesman for the outgoing government, confidence in Macron’s camp remains high.\n\n“I am convinced that the French will give the president of the republic the means to act to protect them, with a majority [in the National Assembly],” Attal told BFMTV-RMC on Monday morning.\n\nHaving limited manoeuvring room due to a lack of partisan alliances beyond the existing majority, Macron’s camp will try to convince voters of other political inclinations or, at best, conclude circumstantial agreements in the territories where this is possible.\n\nDiamantopoulos believes Macron could build a “presidential majority that would start with the former Gaullists (centre-right Républicains) and reach the hinge of the left, including perhaps even a part of the Socialist Party and, of course, the ecologists”.\n\nMacron must therefore, according to Diamantopoulos, “wink at the ecologists” the day after the election. His promise to appoint a prime minister “in charge of ecological planning” would be a step in this direction.\n\nBut the question is: when will this appointment take place? Diamantopoulos warned that this plan could be changed, depending on the results of the legislative elections, which will tilt the future government more to the right or the left, and thus define Macron’s alliance choices.\n\nAs a reminder, in 2017 he chose Edouard Philippe from the centre-right as prime minister, even though he was not forced to do so, having acquired a solid majority in the Assembly, as well as several other ministers from the right.\n\nAt the same time, Macron will also have to devote some of his energy to the French EU presidency.\n\n“He needs to ensure the ongoing French EU presidency is a success. It ends on June 30 and there is an upcoming conference on the Western Balkans to be organised soon, which provides an opportunity to start rethinking the EU’s enlargement policy,” Tara Varma of the European Council on Foreign Relations told EURACTIV in emailed comments.\n\n“Macron will have to take the mantle of European diplomatic leadership again. He mentioned Ukraine in his victory speech. He should travel to Kyiv immediately with (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz to demonstrate Europe’s support for Ukraine,” she said.\n\nBig relief after Macron's re-election but 'third round' ahead French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to unite a deeply divided nation after winning re-election on Sunday (24 April) in a battle against rival Marine Le Pen that saw the far right come its closest yet to taking power.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]", 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57636418-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nMacron loses the French territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost 3 million.\n\nLe Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nMacron could only claim victory in the Pacific islands such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris.

On Sunday, the sitting French president defeated Le Pen with 58.5 percent of the vote — provoking a sigh of relief from many environmental activists, despite their quarrels with Macron during his previous 5-year term.\n\nLe Pen’s energy plan had called for exiting the European Union’s electricity market, accelerating the development of nuclear power, and establishing a moratorium on wind and solar development. (Nuclear currently provides about 70 percent of the country’s electricity; wind and solar combined provide only about 10 percent.) “Wind turbines are ugly and they ruin our landscapes,” Le Pen said in the April 20 debate. The far-right candidate had also vowed to cut the value-added tax on gas, electricity, and oil from 20 percent to 5.5 percent — a move that would have cost the government up to 12 billion euros (nearly $12.9 billion) and boosted demand for fossil fuels.\n\nGrist relies on the support of generous readers like you to keep our climate news free.

Here's How\n\nThe president’s climate policies could also spill over into neighboring European countries. France is currently the leader of the European Union Council, which is tasked with implementing Europe’s “Green Deal” — a massive spending package designed to help the continent get off fossil fuels. And Macron has been one of the most outspoken critics of using Russian coal and oil in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, calling for an outright blockade on the import of those fuels into the E.U. “The results of elections in France always reverberate way beyond the country’s borders,” Lucie Mattera, head of European politics at the think tank E3G, told E&E News last week. “And 2022 is no exception.”\n\nBut critics have argued that the president struggled to implement his climate agenda during his first term. After promising to cut emissions in his first presidential election, in 2017, Macron instituted increases in France’s fuel tax, with the aim of reducing emissions from the transportation sector. The resulting price hike sparked the gilet jaunes, or “yellow vests” movement, with hundreds of thousands of French citizens protesting in the streets.\n\nChagrined, Macron repealed the tax increases and launched a program of public participation in government — including a Citizens’ Convention on Climate, a randomly selected group of 150 voters tasked with helping the country create new climate policy. The president promised to pass their proposals on to the legislature or to a referendum “without filter” — but there, too, he ran into conflict. After the convention released its 149 proposals, Macron preemptively vetoed three of them, including a tax on corporate profits to fund clean energy. Only a few dozen of the citizens’ suggestions ended up in France’s sweeping 2021 climate law, and those often in watered-down form.\n\nIn the short term, the reelected president has promised to create a new prime minister position focused on “ecological planning” and increase investments in renewable technologies. Part of that may be an act of political expediency: Macron was shifted left during the campaign by the popular primary run of the leftist candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who attracted many young voters with his calls for a 200 billion euro ($214 billion) investment in green infrastructure and a constitutional amendment to protect biodiversity. The support for Mélenchon, Macron said in a speech last week, had sent a “powerful message.”", 'image': 'https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron_election_presidential_climate.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

Brigitte’s family owned the most famous bakery in town. Emmanuel’s parents were doctors. They all knew each other. The Macrons tried to end the matter by sending their son to Paris. It was useless: Brigitte separated and visited Emmanuel on weekends. For her, Emmanuel was “a Mozart,” a boy who dazzled her with his intelligence and maturity. For him, Brigitte meant and still means everything.\n\nStill a minor, Emmanuel Macron broke with his family and with his hometown. He and Brigitte took on the world. It remains an indestructible union. The current president of France does not have great friends or confidants: Brigitte is enough for him. Without Brigitte, Macron cannot be understood.\n\nSeveral people who know Macron (as far as it is possible to know someone who is essentially hermetic) agree that he is a man who lives out his life as a fictional character, in search of increasingly sensational challenges and adventures. That craving is likely related to the taboo that was broken in 1992.\n\n“I think he would have liked to be a writer or an actor, and he applies his dramatic talent to politics as well as to his own life,” says Gaspard Gantzer, who was his classmate at the National School of Administration and then at the Elysée Palace: Macron was an adviser to president François Hollande, Gantzer was the press officer.\n\nMacron is a seducer capable of charming almost anyone. He sleeps very little, his memory is extraordinary and his capacity for work almost unlimited. “We are talking about a very, very brilliant man,” says Manuel Valls, France’s prime minister when Macron was economy minister.\n\n“He knows how to be cold when it suits him and he maintains his cool at all times, but he tends to take a positive approach to things and is capable of being very thoughtful and caring,” says Gantzer. All the people consulted agree in underlining two virtues of Macron: physical courage, which has more than once made him face hostile crowds (and get out of it thanks to his charm), and audacity. He was a good corporate banker at Rothschild. In that job, he learned to take risks and jump at any opportunity.\n\n"Where others see charm and friendliness, I have failed to see anything other than superficiality and narcissism," says a conservative politician who prefers not to be quoted.\n\nThe traitor\n\nEmmanuel Macron is haunted by the shadow of Eugène de Rastignac, the most famous social climber in French literature. Rastignac appears in several novels by Honoré de Balzac: he is a hustler who prospers in finances thanks to his lover’s husband; he marries his lover’s daughter and achieves a good position in Parisian society. “All politicians have something of Rastignac,” concedes Manuel Valls. “And the French system favors personality-driven ventures.”\n\nMacron, during his campaign trip to Marseille, on April 16. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nValls, who after serving as French prime minister later became a city councilor in Barcelona (he is a dual Spanish-French citizen), was one of the victims of the great conspiracy developed by Macron from inside the Élysée. He had fierce clashes with his economy minister and went to great lengths to convince then-president François Hollande to remove Macron from the palace. It was useless: Hollande fell under Macron’s spell until “the methodical betrayal” of his protégé, in Hollande’s own words, became evident. It was already too late.\n\nLe traître et le néant (or The traitor and the void), the book on Emmanuel Macron written by journalists Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme, confirms over and over again that Emmanuel Macron’s ability to fascinate is multiplied with older men and greater power. As soon as he left the National School of Administration, Macron successfully sought the protection of the most powerful men of the Republic: Jacques Attali and Alain Minc, two president-makers. It was Minc who procured him a job at the Rothschild Bank, so that he could amass wealth before devoting himself to politics. And it was Attali who brought him close to the Socialist Party and François Hollande.\n\nDuring Hollande’s presidency, first as an adviser and then as a minister, Emmanuel Macron played his own game. Luck helped him, as always: the strokes of fortune of the current president of France are legendary. When he was about to leave the Élysée for a well-paid teaching position, for example, a stroke of luck led him to the Ministry of Economy. In addition to luck, boldness and an amazing ability to deceive also played a role.\n\nMacron used all the resources of the ministry to weave a dense network of contacts. During his last eight months in office, Macron spent €120,000 on dinners held at the ministerial residence, an imposing glass-enclosed apartment facing the Seine. Some nights there were two dinner shifts with different diners. And a third shift was added at La Rotonde, the Macrons’ favorite brasserie.\n\nMacron was creating En Marche! (the name was chosen by Brigitte because she liked it and the initials coincided with those of her husband) and he repeatedly assured Hollande that it was a political club intended to support his re-election. Instead, together with a group of moderate socialists who felt orphaned by the fall of long-time party heavyweight Dominique Strauss-Kahn (the fall from grace of DSK after being accused of rape was one of Macron’s lucky breaks), Macron was in fact boycotting Hollande and actually preparing his own race for the presidency. The documents were burned in a stove. There was absolute secrecy.\n\nMacron destroyed the options of Hollande and Valls from within. Finally, he announced that he was not a socialist, forced his own dismissal and embarked on the campaign to become president of France.\n\nThe politician\n\nLike a corporate banker, Emmanuel Macron launched a takeover bid (after long secret preparations) for the Socialist Party. The initial core of En Marche! was made up of socialists disappointed by François Hollande, the president who wanted to be “normal” and ended up being irrelevant. Once the main party on the left had been dismantled, he captured very prominent figures from The Republicans, the great Gaullist party on the right. “He was the first to guess that the classic parties had collapsed, that the system was in a state of crisis,” says Manuel Valls.\n\nPerhaps Macron’s first presidential adventure would have failed if Alain Juppé had won the primaries of The Republicans. But François Fillon prevailed, a candidate whose campaign frayed when it was discovered that his wife received a salary without working and that he was irregularly financing his high lifestyle. Another stroke of luck: big banking and big industry abandoned Fillon and turned to Macron.\n\n“There is something Napoleonic in Macron’s brilliant career, he knew how to take risks at the right time and people followed him,” summarizes Valls, who in recent times has gotten closer to his old enemy. As soon as he found out that his rival in the second round would be far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, Macron already felt like a president. And he held a big party at La Rotonde, which was premature according to some and inappropriate according to others, because back then it was considered a disgrace for the far right to even reach the second round of voting.\n\nNobody considers that Macron’s five-year term has been a success. Macron has shown that he knows a lot about France, but very little about the French. La République en Marche, the presidential version of En Marche!, is not a party, but rather a group of clappers dazzled by their leader. The absence of internal criticism, the small role played by members of the government (with the exception of the economy minister, the conservative Bruno Le Maire) and the character of Macron have turned the presidency into a one-man affair.\n\nMacron, the candidate “of the right and of the left,” is a right-wing president. “He has developed a system of government that is too vertical, he has not been able to create a true center party and he has not been able to reach consensus and state pacts,” criticizes Manuel Valls.\n\nThe prosperous and urban France brought Macron to the Elysee. Macron made the mistake of governing for that France alone, and not for the other one that is rural, poorly paid and depends on diesel and subsidies. He insisted on underestimating the revolt of the “yellow vests,” with whom his prime minister, the conservative Édouard Philippe, rejected any negotiation. The president put an end to the crisis by taking to the streets in person to hold large public debates that lasted entire days.\n\nMacron, along with his wife, Brigitte, inside Nanterre stadium, on the outskirts of Paris, on April 2. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nHe was unable to enjoy his success. The pandemic emerged and the liberal economic policy was transformed into a policy of massive subsidies. Now, inflation and war have accentuated the exceptionality. The mysterious phrase issued by Jacques Attali, his great mentor, will always float over the politics of Emmanuel Macron: “Macron embodies nothingness.”\n\nThe philosopher\n\nEmmanuel Macron relentlessly feeds his aura as a president-philosopher, as a romantic intellectual who cannot end the day without reading some of René Char’s poems or immersing himself in a metaphysical treatise. There is, however, a flaw in the character. Macron was twice rejected at the École Normale Supérieure (Normal Sup), the true Olympus of the humanities in France. He had to settle for studying philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, where admission is much easier. It is true that the double rejection occurred at a stormy time, when the young Emmanuel and Brigitte had just broken ties with their past and taken refuge in Paris.\n\n"Perhaps the legend of Macron as a great intellectual has been exaggerated, and perhaps he has done his best to exaggerate that legend," says one of France\'s most renowned philosophers, a man who participated in some of the Bercy dinners and prefers not to be cited. "I see him more as a great technocrat, banker and high official, with a sensitivity to culture and humanistic concerns, but with a relatively superficial philosophical knowledge."\n\nGaspard Gantzer insists that Macron sees himself as a writer. A writer without any written work, in any case. The current president often speaks of the influence exerted on him by Paul Ricoeur, the great figure of French phenomenology, a unanimously respected humanist and socialist philosopher. “It was Ricoeur who pushed me into politics,” he once said.\n\nMacron helped Ricoeur as an editorial assistant on his latest and best-known work, Memory, History, Forgetting. Basically, he looked for documentation and wrote up the bibliographic records. He took advantage of his relationship with Ricoeur to get on the editorial board of Esprit, the best-known French journal on philosophy, and publish a few articles with very little impact.\n\nThe current president graduated in philosophy (he is also a finance inspector) with a thesis on Machiavelli, whose work he has not stopped reading. The “Jupiterian” tone of his presidency, in the most majestic sense of the term, and his predilection for results, rather than for theories and principles, are possibly related to his Machiavellian studies.\n\n“They say that Macron exercises power as an enlightened despot, which has its logic, because enlightened despotism is the system that is usually associated with the prince-philosopher,” said Francis Wolff, a professor emeritus of philosophy at Normal Sup and a world authority on Aristotle, in statements to the authors of The traitor and the void.\n\nThere is almost unanimous agreement in his close circle about Macron’s talent when it comes to reciting poetry. He has memorized thousands of verses, his delivery is strong and he uses the resources of an actor. If necessary, he can also sit down at the piano: he studied it for 10 years. On the whole, he has a much higher cultural veneer than is usual among heads of state and government. And he loves for people to notice it.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/KRW02FqOeEcLxlEDFjjIV-lyGF8=/1200x0/filters:focal(584x435:594x445)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/A4TNZCX3AVHXZPJVY7QFQO6ZHQ.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:09'}

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us.

Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister.

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

At the same time, most age groups were split more evenly between Macron and Le Pen; the only group that went all out for the incumbent president were the 18-to-24-year-olds. Yes, Generation Z, the post-millennials, saved Macron. And not so much because of their outpouring love for the president, but out of their fear of the alternative.\n\nThe French presidential election system was set up this way by President Charles de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic. The two-round system (no one gets 51% of the votes in the first round) often forces a second-round competition between a centrist and an extremist candidate, and the majority always prefers the centrist. Next, France will have a parliamentary election and the reelected Macron will campaign for the voters to give his party the majority so that his premiere would be from his own party and not, embarrassingly, from the opposition. He’ll get that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo, how come, on Monday morning, the euro fell 0.34% against the dollar, to $1.07725, close to its two-year low last week? Reuters suggested investors may be relieved to see that Le Pen is not in office, but this doesn’t mean they have high expectations of the winner. Still, the nationalist Le Pen promised to nationalize some key parts of France’s industry, cut taxes radically, and curtail France’s participation in the EU budget. The nightmare is over, investors, what’s holding y’all back?\n\nTurns out the future of the world’s economy is mired in anxiety: US stocks are not performing; futures are declining; China is being revisited by the pandemic it may have invented, so large chunks of its workforce are under lockdowns; supply chains are getting bogged down even worse than before; and Putin continues to try to salvage some measure of victory over Ukraine in time for May 9, the anniversary of the Red Army’s victory over the Nazis.\n\nThe dollar roared over in Israel, too, where it struck NIS 3.27 for the first time in who knows how long. It has probably more to do with the Fed raising interest rates recently than with French politics, but it couldn’t come at a better time, when Israel is struggling to retool its economy and restart its lavish exports again.\n\nMost French Jews heaved a sigh of relief over Macron’s win, especially Orthodox Jews – who would normally align with the right-wing candidate. The reason is that Le Pen, despite her cosmetic efforts, is more an old-fashion fascist than a modern-day extreme right-winger. As part of her fierce anti-immigration (some say xenophobic) policy, she promised to ban animal slaughter without stunning, insisting that stunning the animal is more humane. Of course, stunning renders the animal as “traif” for both Jews and Muslims, who threatened that they would leave France if they were deprived of their kosher and halal meat (If Le Pen Wins, She’ll Ban Kosher Shechita in France).\n\nAnd since France exports kosher meat, a ban on its production in France would have had a devastating impact on Jewish communities elsewhere, most notably in neighboring Switzerland.\n\nMany right-wing Israelis didn’t see a big distinction between Macron and Le Pen because both support the two-state solution and a Palestinian state. But if that’s your litmus test, then most Western and Third-World countries should be classified as anti-Israel. I thought Macron stood out as a friend a couple of weeks ago, when he clashed with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, calling him a “far-right antisemite.” So Emanuel can’t be all bad.\n\nHere’s what happened: Morawiecki compared the French president’s phone calls with Vladimir Putin to negotiating with Hitler. Now, you may support Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine or be against them, but they just don’t compare with what Hitler did to most of Europe and the rest of the planet. In response, Macron told Le Parisien that Morawiecki was trying to help Le Pen, and called him a “far-right antisemite who bans LGBT persons” in his country.\n\nA spokesman for Morawiecki said it was a lie and the Polish PM wasn’t an antisemite. But he kind of is. In 2018 he said Jews were involved in perpetrating the Holocaust (which would have been a brilliant solution to the supply chain problems). And Morawiecki is also behind the Polish law that punishes anyone who blames Poles for taking part in the Nazi Holocaust crimes.\n\nAnd, in June 2021, after Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called the new Polish law barring Jews from filing Holocaust restitution claims in Poland “immoral,” PM Morawiecki said, “I can only say that as long as I am the prime minister, Poland will not pay for German crimes: Neither zloty, nor euro, nor dollar.”\n\nSee? It always comes down to economics.

The centre has held. Yesterday (24 April), 2022 stopped being 2022 just long enough for Emmanuel Macron to see off Marine Le Pen and secure re-election as the president of France. The result came as a great relief to millions around the world.\n\n\n\nMany are tempted to try and read into the result some grander narrative in which Europe remains a sort of liberal Hyperborea, a paradise from which the British expelled themselves in 2016 (together with Americans in electing Donald Trump). On closer inspection, however, this conception doesn’t quite square with the bald reality: the Rassemblement National (RN), a party explicitly rooted in the post-fascist far right, has just taken 41 per cent of the second-round vote in one of the European Union’s most important member states.\n\nAdmirers in Britain have long been prepared to overlook the unfortunate truth that France is home to one of the world’s largest white far-right parties. While Macron might have won yesterday’s election, the trend of the far right is only upward in France. Back in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, first broke through to contest the second round of the presidential election, French voters united around Jacques Chirac and rejected the Front National (as the RN was known at the time) by more than four to one. The elder Le Pen took less than 18 per cent of the second-round vote. Yet in 2017, his daughter Marine won more than 33 per cent – and yesterday, she won 41 per cent. Furthermore, while in Britain even the respectable right has serious trouble wooing younger voters, polling by YouGov has suggested that in France the RN is ahead with voters aged 18-24, as well as winning voters directly from the far left.\n\nFrance is not the only EU country to display this trend, however: there are plenty of other correctives for anyone who, despairing of the UK’s current government, might pine for a lost Eden across the English Channel. Across southern Europe the long political legacy of the EU’s tough response to the financial crisis plays out in the rise of right-wing parties that, like the RN, harbour more or less explicit links to historical anti-democratic movements. Italy not only contains the populist party Lega Nord but its smaller ally Fratelli d’Italia, whose logo features the familiar tricoloured flame of the postwar far right.\n\nRelated\n\nIn Spain meanwhile, Vox, a party with Francoist undertones, has outflanked Madrid’s traditional parties of the right on the question of Spanish unity, and secured its first beachhead in government. In eastern Europe, there is the organised, multinational challenge of the Visegrád Group; while in wealthy northern Europe, the social democratic Danish government recently adopted what Foreign Policy called “one of the harshest refugee policies in the world”.\n\nIn contrast, despite the performative toughness of the Rwanda proposals, the United Kingdom operates what the statistics show to be a pretty liberal immigration regime. Whatever its flaws, no sober observer can conflate the Conservative Party with the far-right movements gaining ground on the continent.\n\nNone of this is proof that Brexit was a good idea, of course, nor that France and Europe are not home to real liberal achievements. But we should accept that a country in which Le Pen takes 40 per cent of the vote is no nirvana.', 'image': 'https://www.newstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1236459286-1038x778.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:50'}

Faced with the prospect of a far-right takeover of the Élysée, a sufficient number of voters put aside their reservations regarding Emmanuel Macron and made him the first president to win a second term in office for 20 years. In the end, Mr Macron’s 58%-42% victory over Marine Le Pen was much more comfortable than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when some polls predicted a knife-edge contest.\n\nFor France – and the rest of Europe – the alternative outcome would have been disastrous and destabilising. Ms Le Pen’s authoritarian, nationalist and xenophobic vision would have led to civil strife domestically and undermined solidarity between western democracies at a vital time. That Mr Macron successfully averted this worst-case scenario is a cause for celebration. But as his victory speech on Sunday night tacitly acknowledged, an election won with the help of the fear factor has delivered an exceptionally fragile mandate. Describing France as riven by doubt and division, Mr Macron pledged to be “not the candidate of one camp, but the president of all of us”. Such assurances are commonplace from victorious political leaders, but it is vital that Mr Macron makes good on them during a second term, which looks challenging to say the least.\n\nAs the election laid bare, France is dangerously divided along economic and generational fault lines. A majority of blue-collar workers – and more than four in 10 voters overall – opted for Ms Le Pen. This, the best score in the history of the French far right, allowed Ms Le Pen to declare her share of the vote a “victory in itself”. Disturbingly, it indicates that the normalisation of her movement is all but complete. Mr Macron’s core vote, by contrast, came from wealthy business people, middle-class professionals and retired people. Younger, well educated but economically precarious voters who supported the radical left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round were left without a dog in the fight.\n\nReflecting widespread disillusionment with the choice on offer, particularly among the young, the rate of abstention was the highest for a presidential runoff since 1969. Among potential voters under the age of 25, more than 40% failed to cast a ballot. Enough voters on the left lent their support to Mr Macron to keep the far right out of power, but in fewer numbers than in 2017. Hostilities on the right and the left will now be resumed ahead of parliamentary elections in June.\n\nIf he is to successfully navigate this volatile political landscape, Mr Macron will need to adopt a radically different playbook from the one that characterised his first five years in the Élysée. During that time, he acquired a reputation as the “president of the rich” after watering down a wealth tax, pursuing unpopular pension reforms and imposing a fuel tax that sparked the gilets jaunes movement. An autocratic style contributed to the widespread impression that Mr Macron’s declared intention to transform and liberalise the French economy would be accomplished at the expense of the less well-off.\n\nTo make good on his aspirations to reach out across the divides, Mr Macron will need to do far more to address such concerns and insecurities. During a campaign that became unexpectedly close, there were signs that this was being recognised. In an encouraging early statement of intent, it has already been signalled that there will be full consultation with unions and other bodies over proposals to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, in a still fragile post-Covid economy, Mr Macron should also recognise that more needs to be done to protect and improve the living standards of blue-collar workers and the youthful precariat, which voted en masse for Mr Mélenchon. As he contemplates five more years in office, Mr Macron must realise that he has been given not so much a mandate as another chance.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f9dc305d6b01ad6e862da6d17afc1f0e1d372f/0_0_4625_2774/master/4625.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4f9959a701f15dfce678c4ac1137a3cd', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:42'}

Emmanuel Macron obtained 18,779,641 votes on April 24, 2022, i.e. 58.54% of the votes cast, putting him well ahead of the election. But this flattering score falls to 38.52% of the electorate, i.e. the registered voters. In other words, nearly two thirds of the French did not vote Macron. Worse: between 2017 and 2022, Macron lost 1,963,487 votes! This is not the triumph that we would like to believe.\n\nAt the same time, Marine Le Pen totals 13,297,760 votes (27.28% of registered voters) and gains 2,659,285 votes in five years !\n\n63% of the French for a cohabitation\n\nThese figures attest to the rejection of the re-elected president and his policies during his five-year term. It is so true that an OpinionWay poll for Cnews reveals “that one person in three who voted Macron in the second round wants him not to have a majority in the National Assembly.” And 63% of the French registered voters want a cohabitation with the appointment of a Prime Minister from an opposition party.\n\nIn other words, many voters voted for Macron to block Marine Le Pen, but they do not want Macron to govern. Here is France divided, fractured, more divided than ever.\n\nCut up like a puzzle\n\nGone is the France cut in two of our youth, with a permanent confrontation between left and right who governed in turn according to the principle of the pendulum. Here is France cut into small pieces, like a puzzle. If it is true that the first round revealed the tri-polarization of French political life, the second round shows us a France of the elites against a France of the people, a France of the big cities against a France of the rural areas, a France of the “bobos”, happy and rich, and a France of the eternally forgotten, of the poor (there are 10 million of them) who can neither find decent housing, nor heat, nor food, nor entertainment.\n\nIn these conditions, how can one be the president “of all the French”? Macron’s France will become a country regularly shaken by political and social convulsions, like the Gilets jaunes. The legislative elections of June 12 and 19 will give us a glimpse of the turmoil that will shake the country under the Macron presidency.', 'image': 'https://frenchdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Macron1-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:25'}

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

He added investors should concentrate on the reopening of the economy that is boosting the services sector and giving a surprise lift to construction.\n\n“The recent pull-back in share prices has left the market on an attractive valuation and appears inexpensive versus government bonds,” said Darby.', 'image': 'https://images.mktw.net/im-530706/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:19'}

The next congress of the leaders of the populist right will be a congress of losers.”\n\n“A victory for Marine Le Pen would be a victory for the vision of a Europe of selfish states, of which the Kremlin would be most happy,” commented Władysław Kosiniak – Kamysz, a lawmaker for the centrist/agrarian Polish People’s Party.\n\n“France and Europe defended by Emmanuel Macron against hatred, backwardness, and Putin,” tweeted Maciej Gdula, a social-democratic lawmaker from the New Left.\n\nIn Prague, which will soon take over from France the EU Council rotating presidency, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala (ODS, ECR) said France is a “vital partner”, while Czech Parliament’s speaker Markéta Pekarová Adamová (TOP 09, EPP) said populism and nationalism have lost and that France will continue to be a partner in the EU and NATO.\n\nIn Slovakia, Defence Minister Jaroslav Naď (OĽaNO) stated Macron’s re-election is “excellent news for whole democratic world”, stressing the clear stance of Macron towards Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nIn Hungary, so far, there has been no official government reaction.\n\nEuropean federalist MEP Dobrev Klára from Democratic Coalition (DK) hailed Macron’s victory, while “Viktor Orban’s ally and friend in the region, Janez Janša, and his populist right-wing Slovenian Democratic Party lost the elections […] Both is great news for Europe’s friends”.\n\nThe German message\n\n“Your voters have also sent a strong message of commitment to Europe today,” German chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Twitter. During this election, finance minister Christian Lindner added that France was standing at the crossroads, stressing that “the united Europe is the biggest winner of this election.”\n\nHowever, the strong result of Le Pen has prompted concern. Ahead of Macron now lies the task of “rallying the French people, who voted strongly for right-wing and left-wing populists in this round of elections, probably out of disappointment, behind the political centre again,” Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesperson of the conservative CDU told EURACTIV.\n\nThe result is a “serious reminder” to the French president that “France now needs a social and ecological renewal” as France is facing “deep social divides,” a senior Social Democrat, MEP Udo Bullmann, told EURACTIV.\n\n“Emmanuel Macron’s election victory was more important for Europe than the German federal election. France has voted against right-wing populism and resentment and favoured President Macron’s Europe,” chancellor candidate for the CDU/CSU in 2021, Armin Laschet, told EURACTIV.\n\nAustrian and Dutch leaders also focused on the pro-EU signal of Macron’s victory.\n\nIn Rome, Madrid, Lisbon and Athens, leaders highlighted France’s commitment to the European project.\n\nIn Italy, Lega leader Matteo Salvini congratulated Le Pen, tweeting: “Congratulations, Marine! Alone against everyone, coherent and smiling, you have gathered the vote of 13 million French people, an unprecedented rate. Together for a Europe based on work, family, security, rights and freedom”.\n\nGreek MEP Stelios Kouloglou told EURACTIV that all polls show that disadvantaged French people support the far-right candidate as they feel marginalised by the political and social system. “Far-right demagogues are all over Europe are waiting if the problems of the vast majority are not solved.”\n\n“Five years is very little in history. In France, the next match may have very unpleasant surprises. For now, France and the EU are saved.

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

Police used tear gas to disperse gatherings in Paris and the western city of Rennes.\n\n- New era -\n\nIn a victory speech on the Champ de Mars in central Paris at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, Macron vowed to respond to the anger of voters who backed his far-right rival, saying his new term would not continue unchanged from the last five years.\n\n"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right," he told thousands of cheering supporters.\n\n"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me."\n\nHe also pledged a "renewed method" to govern France, adding that this "new era" would not be one of "continuity with the last term which is now ending".\n\nIn a combative speech to supporters in Paris in which she accepted the result but showed no sign of quitting politics, Le Pen, 53, said she would "never abandon" the French and was already preparing for the June legislative elections.\n\n"The result represents a brilliant victory," she said to cheers.\n\n"This evening, we launched the great battle for the legislative elections," Le Pen said, adding that she felt "hope" and calling on opponents of the president to join with her National Rally (RN) party.\n\n- \'Count on France\' -\n\nThe result is narrower than the second-round clash in 2017, when the same two candidates met in the run-off and Macron polled over 66 percent of the vote.\n\nFor Le Pen, her third defeat in presidential polls will be a bitter pill to swallow after she plowed years of effort into making herself electable and distancing her party from the legacy of its founder, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nCritics insisted her party never stopped being extreme-right and racist while Macron repeatedly pointed to her plan to ban the wearing of the Muslim headscarf in public if elected.\n\nThe projections caused immense relief in Europe after fears a Le Pen presidency would leave the continent rudderless following Brexit and the departure from politics of German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news for all of Europe" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nEU president Charles Michel said the bloc could now "count on France for five more years" while Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also congratulated him, saying she was "delighted to be able to continue our excellent cooperation".\n\nIn another election Sunday, Slovenia\'s three-time Prime Minister Janez Jansa, criticized by opponents as an authoritarian right-wing populist, was at risk of losing power to a party led by political newcomer Robert Golob.\n\n- \'Ocean of abstention\' -\n\nMacron will be hoping for a less complicated second term that will allow him to implement his vision of more pro-business reform and tighter EU integration, after a first term shadowed by protests, then the pandemic and finally Russia\'s military operation in Ukraine.\n\nBut he will have to win over those who backed his opponents and the millions of French who did not bother to vote.\n\nPolling organizations estimated turnout of just 72 percent, the lowest in any presidential election second-round run-off since 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, according to partial results, 6.45 percent of voters in the election voted for neither candidate in blank ballots while 2.35 percent spoilt their papers.\n\nThe hard-left third-placed candidate in the first round, Jean-Luc Melenchon, had refused to endorse Macron.\n\nHe has his eyes firmly set on the June elections.\n\nMelenchon welcomed Le Pen\'s defeat as "very good news for the unity of our people" but said Le Pen and Macron had barely managed to win a third of support from registered voters.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots", he said.', 'image': 'https://cdnimgen.royanews.tv/imageserv/Size728Q40/news/20220425/35368.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:44'}

And so do U.S. voters in general, not just Republicans. Nearly 60 percent of those who participated in a recent Gallup poll said there was too much immigration into the country. That makes anti-immigrant sentiment mainstream. Le Pen\'s platform also proposed that non-citizen immigrants arrested for any crime be sent back to their country of origin. This fringe position in France is the law of the land in America and has been for years.\n\n"They\'re bringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime. They\'re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," Donald Trump said on the day in 2015 that he announced he was running for president. During his tenure in office, Trump took many different steps to limit immigration, and not just the illegal sort. In fact, in 2020, he reduced the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. by 49 percent.\n\nWhat puts Le Pen and the National Rally Party in the far-right corner of politics, then? Like her near-fascist father before her, Le Pen isn\'t fond of immigrants, and I mean really not fond . She wants them to assimilate to French culture to the point where they would be indistinguishable from France\'s original immigrants (or rather, invaders), the Germanic Franks, who came for a visit to the Roman Empire in the 4th century and never went away. But even more than assimilating, Le Pen and her party would much rather immigrants just go back to where they came from.\n\nAnalysts all over the world woke up on Monday morning to mourn the fact that far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen wasn\'t beaten soundly enough, even though she lost by more than 16 points to a man few people in France apparently love , the incumbent Emmanuel Macron.\n\nNational Rally is also famously skeptical of international alliances, especially those with NATO and the European Union. France is one of the founding members of the EU, and along with Germany, forms its heart. For France to leave the Union would gut it, and possibly bring an end to the "European project" of peace and economic cooperation for the continent. But such actions don\'t send a shudder down the spine of Americans; Trump for his part killed a major trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, threatened to undo America\'s free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, pulled out of the Paris climate treaty, and came closer than we ever knew to essentially pulling the U.S. out of NATO — all to the applause of many Republicans.\n\nTrump was not standing out in the cold on the issue of NATO, either. Before the war in Ukraine, only 48 percent of Americans thought the organization was doing a good job, and a full 65 percent of Republicans thought it was doing a poor job. If France is the heart of the EU, the U.S. simply is NATO. The U.S. founded the alliance and provides a shield for the other members that fall under the American aegis. This may change, thanks Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s war in Ukraine, which has forced Europe to rethink its role in its own defense, but as of right now, U.S. leadership is clear and unquestioned.\n\nAnd speaking of the war in Ukraine and Russia in general, Le Pen and Trump share something else: A love for Putin. Over and over, Trump praised Putin for his intelligence, strength, and the high quality of his negotiating tactics. He even asked for Russia to help him get dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, which is widely believed to have been tainted by Russian interference, both online and off. Le Pen is also deeply tied to Putin, speaking warmly of the autocrat while her National Rally happily took Russian money. She has praised Putin\'s nationalism and skepticism of globalization.\n\nLe Pen\'s economic policies are not a one-to-one correlation with those in the GOP — this is France after all, so some "socialism" on health care and other issues are required — but the fear of corporate globalism is exactly the same. Trump\'s "America First" economics fit very well with Le Pen\'s ideas.\n\nOn social issues, National Rally had to moderate several positions to become competitive in France. Gay marriage and abortion play their part in the political process over there, just as they do here, and Le Pen had to loosen up. The difference here is that America\'s far-right is succeeding in protecting the "traditional values" of the Dark Ages.\n\nSo could Le Pen be elected in America? No, she\'s a foreigner. But as far as her positions go, there\'s very little to bar a politician like her. We\'ve already voted for people on the local and national levels who make Le Pen practically look like a liberal. Even her position that Muslims should not be allowed to wear headscarves in public places, while extreme, falls in line with overall American feelings about Muslims.\n\nEven now, as President Biden is being praised elsewhere in the world for rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and reaffirming America\'s commitment to NATO, there are viable presidential candidates waiting in the wings to undo that work. And even if they don\'t win in 2024, chances are they\'ll be a lot closer to the White House than 16 points behind.', 'image': 'https://mediacloud.theweek.com/image/upload/s--X-WVjvBW--/f_auto,t_content-image-full-desktop@1/v1650910407/Trump le pen.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

[…] They have no potential to form an alliance”, and it is easier for “the forces around the centre to form an alliance”, Diamantopoulos told EURACTIV France.\n\nBut in recent days, Mélenchon has unequivocally called on his supporters: “I ask you to elect me Prime minister”.\n\nBetween the fact that “there will be no defections” in favour of Mélenchon’s party and the “under-representation of the extremes”, the possibility that his appeal will become a reality in the ballot box remains dim.\n\nAnother element that works against the most radical parties is that “there are two ‘anti-system’ expressions, one on the far right and the other on the left”.\n\nFor these reasons, eight deputies were elected under the banner of the Rassemblement National in 2017, despite qualifying for the second round of the presidential election, and Mélenchon’s party had seventeen. These results are far below the overall results at the national level.\n\nThe (new) attempt to unite the left\n\nOn the left, the urgent need for unity is being felt both by executives and voters, in order to regain influence and hope to impose a social and ecological majority on Macron.\n\nContacted by EURACTIV France, Sylvie Guillaume, a Socialist MEP, said she hoped that “the legislative elections [will make it possible to] restore a better balance because the presidential election is not a blank check” for the newly re-elected president.\n\nThe same is true of the Insoumis — Mélenchon’s supporters — who want to believe in uniting the left.\n\nMEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV France that her movement “appeals to those who do not feel represented” and admits to being in discussion with the other left-wing forces, to agree on “a common base”.\n\nThe call of Mélenchon and his supporters seem to have been heard by the other left-wing movements. Europe Ecologie Les Verts MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV France that “the political forces of the left and the ecologists must organise themselves to weigh together if they do not want to condemn themselves to lose separately”.\n\nLéon Deffontaines, president of the young communists’ movement, told EURACTIV France he hoped to see “the ideas of equality, sharing and solidarity become the majority again”.\n\nCommunist candidate Fabien Roussel pleaded on Sunday evening for a “global agreement” of the left, demanding that “local anchors and different sensibilities on the left be taken into account” in order to avoid the distribution benefiting only La France Insoumise, which largely dominated the left in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nYet, according to Diamantopoulos, even if “some constituencies [the left] could get some MPs elected” the idea of “getting close to a parliamentary majority is a political fiction”.\n\nWhat majority for Macron?\n\nDespite the parliamentary challenges, Macron will not throw in the towel.\n\nJudging by the comments of Gabriel Attal, spokesman for the outgoing government, confidence in Macron’s camp remains high.\n\n“I am convinced that the French will give the president of the republic the means to act to protect them, with a majority [in the National Assembly],” Attal told BFMTV-RMC on Monday morning.\n\nHaving limited manoeuvring room due to a lack of partisan alliances beyond the existing majority, Macron’s camp will try to convince voters of other political inclinations or, at best, conclude circumstantial agreements in the territories where this is possible.\n\nDiamantopoulos believes Macron could build a “presidential majority that would start with the former Gaullists (centre-right Républicains) and reach the hinge of the left, including perhaps even a part of the Socialist Party and, of course, the ecologists”.\n\nMacron must therefore, according to Diamantopoulos, “wink at the ecologists” the day after the election. His promise to appoint a prime minister “in charge of ecological planning” would be a step in this direction.\n\nBut the question is: when will this appointment take place? Diamantopoulos warned that this plan could be changed, depending on the results of the legislative elections, which will tilt the future government more to the right or the left, and thus define Macron’s alliance choices.\n\nAs a reminder, in 2017 he chose Edouard Philippe from the centre-right as prime minister, even though he was not forced to do so, having acquired a solid majority in the Assembly, as well as several other ministers from the right.\n\nAt the same time, Macron will also have to devote some of his energy to the French EU presidency.\n\n“He needs to ensure the ongoing French EU presidency is a success. It ends on June 30 and there is an upcoming conference on the Western Balkans to be organised soon, which provides an opportunity to start rethinking the EU’s enlargement policy,” Tara Varma of the European Council on Foreign Relations told EURACTIV in emailed comments.\n\n“Macron will have to take the mantle of European diplomatic leadership again. He mentioned Ukraine in his victory speech. He should travel to Kyiv immediately with (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz to demonstrate Europe’s support for Ukraine,” she said.\n\nBig relief after Macron's re-election but 'third round' ahead French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to unite a deeply divided nation after winning re-election on Sunday (24 April) in a battle against rival Marine Le Pen that saw the far right come its closest yet to taking power.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]", 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57636418-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

FRANCE 24 takes a look at some of the main takeaways from France\'s presidential vote.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nA nation divided\n\nA post-election map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country while Le Pen won backing in the struggling northern industrial heartlands, the Mediterranean south and French overseas territories.\n\nBig city centres, the upper-middle classes and older voters backed Macron while lower-income groups voted overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\nBut according to Mathieu Gallard, research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, it would be a mistake to imagine a country divided between an urban pro-Macron camp and rural Le Pen supporters.\n\n"The biggest fractures are, above all, generational and social," said Gallard.\n\nRising abstention\n\nTurnout was at just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest of any second-round vote in France since 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who made the effort to turn up at voting stations on Sunday cast a protest vote to send the message that neither candidate was acceptable. Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nMacron loses the French territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost 3 million.\n\nLe Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nMacron could only claim victory in the Pacific islands such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris.

Le Pen, a French nationalist representing the National Rally Party, called Macron a “climate hypocrite.” He jabbed back, dubbing Le Pen a “climate skeptic.”\n\nFor the moment, Macron has won out. On Sunday, the sitting French president defeated Le Pen with 58.5 percent of the vote — provoking a sigh of relief from many environmental activists, despite their quarrels with Macron during his previous 5-year term.\n\nLe Pen’s energy plan had called for exiting the European Union’s electricity market, accelerating the development of nuclear power, and establishing a moratorium on wind and solar development. (Nuclear currently provides about 70 percent of the country’s electricity; wind and solar combined provide only about 10 percent.) “Wind turbines are ugly and they ruin our landscapes,” Le Pen said in the April 20 debate. The far-right candidate had also vowed to cut the value-added tax on gas, electricity, and oil from 20 percent to 5.5 percent — a move that would have cost the government up to 12 billion euros (nearly $12.9 billion) and boosted demand for fossil fuels.\n\nGrist relies on the support of generous readers like you to keep our climate news free.

Here's How\n\nThe president’s climate policies could also spill over into neighboring European countries. France is currently the leader of the European Union Council, which is tasked with implementing Europe’s “Green Deal” — a massive spending package designed to help the continent get off fossil fuels. And Macron has been one of the most outspoken critics of using Russian coal and oil in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, calling for an outright blockade on the import of those fuels into the E.U. “The results of elections in France always reverberate way beyond the country’s borders,” Lucie Mattera, head of European politics at the think tank E3G, told E&E News last week. “And 2022 is no exception.”\n\nBut critics have argued that the president struggled to implement his climate agenda during his first term. After promising to cut emissions in his first presidential election, in 2017, Macron instituted increases in France’s fuel tax, with the aim of reducing emissions from the transportation sector. The resulting price hike sparked the gilet jaunes, or “yellow vests” movement, with hundreds of thousands of French citizens protesting in the streets.\n\nChagrined, Macron repealed the tax increases and launched a program of public participation in government — including a Citizens’ Convention on Climate, a randomly selected group of 150 voters tasked with helping the country create new climate policy. The president promised to pass their proposals on to the legislature or to a referendum “without filter” — but there, too, he ran into conflict. After the convention released its 149 proposals, Macron preemptively vetoed three of them, including a tax on corporate profits to fund clean energy. Only a few dozen of the citizens’ suggestions ended up in France’s sweeping 2021 climate law, and those often in watered-down form.\n\nIn the short term, the reelected president has promised to create a new prime minister position focused on “ecological planning” and increase investments in renewable technologies. Part of that may be an act of political expediency: Macron was shifted left during the campaign by the popular primary run of the leftist candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who attracted many young voters with his calls for a 200 billion euro ($214 billion) investment in green infrastructure and a constitutional amendment to protect biodiversity. The support for Mélenchon, Macron said in a speech last week, had sent a “powerful message.”", 'image': 'https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron_election_presidential_climate.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France.

He is the teenager who fell in love with a 39-year-old teacher and was loved back in return, the Rothschild banker, the man who betrayed former president François Hollande, the pianist, the technocrat, the lover of poetry and theater, and the seducer. This is the portrait of Emmanuel Macron, 44, in four acts:\n\nThe man\n\nEmmanuel Macron was born in Amiens on December 21, 1977, the son of Jean-Michel, a doctor and professor of neurology, and Françoise, a general practitioner. He was the oldest of three brothers.\n\nThe man and the character were born 15 years later, towards the end of 1992, when the schoolboy fell in love with Brigitte Auzière, born Brigitte Trogneux, his French and drama teacher. The love was reciprocated. The teacher was 39 years old, married to a well-known local banker, and one of her daughters was Emmanuel’s classmate.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the impact of such an unconventional (and currently criminal) relationship in a relatively small, provincial city like Amiens, with a population of around 130,000. Brigitte’s family owned the most famous bakery in town. Emmanuel’s parents were doctors. They all knew each other. The Macrons tried to end the matter by sending their son to Paris. It was useless: Brigitte separated and visited Emmanuel on weekends. For her, Emmanuel was “a Mozart,” a boy who dazzled her with his intelligence and maturity. For him, Brigitte meant and still means everything.\n\nStill a minor, Emmanuel Macron broke with his family and with his hometown. He and Brigitte took on the world. It remains an indestructible union. The current president of France does not have great friends or confidants: Brigitte is enough for him. Without Brigitte, Macron cannot be understood.\n\nSeveral people who know Macron (as far as it is possible to know someone who is essentially hermetic) agree that he is a man who lives out his life as a fictional character, in search of increasingly sensational challenges and adventures. That craving is likely related to the taboo that was broken in 1992.\n\n“I think he would have liked to be a writer or an actor, and he applies his dramatic talent to politics as well as to his own life,” says Gaspard Gantzer, who was his classmate at the National School of Administration and then at the Elysée Palace: Macron was an adviser to president François Hollande, Gantzer was the press officer.\n\nMacron is a seducer capable of charming almost anyone. He sleeps very little, his memory is extraordinary and his capacity for work almost unlimited. “We are talking about a very, very brilliant man,” says Manuel Valls, France’s prime minister when Macron was economy minister.\n\n“He knows how to be cold when it suits him and he maintains his cool at all times, but he tends to take a positive approach to things and is capable of being very thoughtful and caring,” says Gantzer. All the people consulted agree in underlining two virtues of Macron: physical courage, which has more than once made him face hostile crowds (and get out of it thanks to his charm), and audacity. He was a good corporate banker at Rothschild. In that job, he learned to take risks and jump at any opportunity.\n\n"Where others see charm and friendliness, I have failed to see anything other than superficiality and narcissism," says a conservative politician who prefers not to be quoted.\n\nThe traitor\n\nEmmanuel Macron is haunted by the shadow of Eugène de Rastignac, the most famous social climber in French literature. Rastignac appears in several novels by Honoré de Balzac: he is a hustler who prospers in finances thanks to his lover’s husband; he marries his lover’s daughter and achieves a good position in Parisian society. “All politicians have something of Rastignac,” concedes Manuel Valls. “And the French system favors personality-driven ventures.”\n\nMacron, during his campaign trip to Marseille, on April 16. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nValls, who after serving as French prime minister later became a city councilor in Barcelona (he is a dual Spanish-French citizen), was one of the victims of the great conspiracy developed by Macron from inside the Élysée. He had fierce clashes with his economy minister and went to great lengths to convince then-president François Hollande to remove Macron from the palace. It was useless: Hollande fell under Macron’s spell until “the methodical betrayal” of his protégé, in Hollande’s own words, became evident. It was already too late.\n\nLe traître et le néant (or The traitor and the void), the book on Emmanuel Macron written by journalists Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme, confirms over and over again that Emmanuel Macron’s ability to fascinate is multiplied with older men and greater power. As soon as he left the National School of Administration, Macron successfully sought the protection of the most powerful men of the Republic: Jacques Attali and Alain Minc, two president-makers. It was Minc who procured him a job at the Rothschild Bank, so that he could amass wealth before devoting himself to politics. And it was Attali who brought him close to the Socialist Party and François Hollande.\n\nDuring Hollande’s presidency, first as an adviser and then as a minister, Emmanuel Macron played his own game. Luck helped him, as always: the strokes of fortune of the current president of France are legendary. When he was about to leave the Élysée for a well-paid teaching position, for example, a stroke of luck led him to the Ministry of Economy. In addition to luck, boldness and an amazing ability to deceive also played a role.\n\nMacron used all the resources of the ministry to weave a dense network of contacts. During his last eight months in office, Macron spent €120,000 on dinners held at the ministerial residence, an imposing glass-enclosed apartment facing the Seine. Some nights there were two dinner shifts with different diners. And a third shift was added at La Rotonde, the Macrons’ favorite brasserie.\n\nMacron was creating En Marche! (the name was chosen by Brigitte because she liked it and the initials coincided with those of her husband) and he repeatedly assured Hollande that it was a political club intended to support his re-election. Instead, together with a group of moderate socialists who felt orphaned by the fall of long-time party heavyweight Dominique Strauss-Kahn (the fall from grace of DSK after being accused of rape was one of Macron’s lucky breaks), Macron was in fact boycotting Hollande and actually preparing his own race for the presidency. The documents were burned in a stove. There was absolute secrecy.\n\nMacron destroyed the options of Hollande and Valls from within. Finally, he announced that he was not a socialist, forced his own dismissal and embarked on the campaign to become president of France.\n\nThe politician\n\nLike a corporate banker, Emmanuel Macron launched a takeover bid (after long secret preparations) for the Socialist Party. The initial core of En Marche! was made up of socialists disappointed by François Hollande, the president who wanted to be “normal” and ended up being irrelevant. Once the main party on the left had been dismantled, he captured very prominent figures from The Republicans, the great Gaullist party on the right. “He was the first to guess that the classic parties had collapsed, that the system was in a state of crisis,” says Manuel Valls.\n\nPerhaps Macron’s first presidential adventure would have failed if Alain Juppé had won the primaries of The Republicans. But François Fillon prevailed, a candidate whose campaign frayed when it was discovered that his wife received a salary without working and that he was irregularly financing his high lifestyle. Another stroke of luck: big banking and big industry abandoned Fillon and turned to Macron.\n\n“There is something Napoleonic in Macron’s brilliant career, he knew how to take risks at the right time and people followed him,” summarizes Valls, who in recent times has gotten closer to his old enemy. As soon as he found out that his rival in the second round would be far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, Macron already felt like a president. And he held a big party at La Rotonde, which was premature according to some and inappropriate according to others, because back then it was considered a disgrace for the far right to even reach the second round of voting.\n\nNobody considers that Macron’s five-year term has been a success. Macron has shown that he knows a lot about France, but very little about the French. La République en Marche, the presidential version of En Marche!, is not a party, but rather a group of clappers dazzled by their leader. The absence of internal criticism, the small role played by members of the government (with the exception of the economy minister, the conservative Bruno Le Maire) and the character of Macron have turned the presidency into a one-man affair.\n\nMacron, the candidate “of the right and of the left,” is a right-wing president. “He has developed a system of government that is too vertical, he has not been able to create a true center party and he has not been able to reach consensus and state pacts,” criticizes Manuel Valls.\n\nThe prosperous and urban France brought Macron to the Elysee. Macron made the mistake of governing for that France alone, and not for the other one that is rural, poorly paid and depends on diesel and subsidies. He insisted on underestimating the revolt of the “yellow vests,” with whom his prime minister, the conservative Édouard Philippe, rejected any negotiation. The president put an end to the crisis by taking to the streets in person to hold large public debates that lasted entire days.\n\nMacron, along with his wife, Brigitte, inside Nanterre stadium, on the outskirts of Paris, on April 2. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nHe was unable to enjoy his success. The pandemic emerged and the liberal economic policy was transformed into a policy of massive subsidies. Now, inflation and war have accentuated the exceptionality. The mysterious phrase issued by Jacques Attali, his great mentor, will always float over the politics of Emmanuel Macron: “Macron embodies nothingness.”\n\nThe philosopher\n\nEmmanuel Macron relentlessly feeds his aura as a president-philosopher, as a romantic intellectual who cannot end the day without reading some of René Char’s poems or immersing himself in a metaphysical treatise. There is, however, a flaw in the character. Macron was twice rejected at the École Normale Supérieure (Normal Sup), the true Olympus of the humanities in France. He had to settle for studying philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, where admission is much easier. It is true that the double rejection occurred at a stormy time, when the young Emmanuel and Brigitte had just broken ties with their past and taken refuge in Paris.\n\n"Perhaps the legend of Macron as a great intellectual has been exaggerated, and perhaps he has done his best to exaggerate that legend," says one of France\'s most renowned philosophers, a man who participated in some of the Bercy dinners and prefers not to be cited. "I see him more as a great technocrat, banker and high official, with a sensitivity to culture and humanistic concerns, but with a relatively superficial philosophical knowledge."\n\nGaspard Gantzer insists that Macron sees himself as a writer. A writer without any written work, in any case. The current president often speaks of the influence exerted on him by Paul Ricoeur, the great figure of French phenomenology, a unanimously respected humanist and socialist philosopher. “It was Ricoeur who pushed me into politics,” he once said.\n\nMacron helped Ricoeur as an editorial assistant on his latest and best-known work, Memory, History, Forgetting. Basically, he looked for documentation and wrote up the bibliographic records. He took advantage of his relationship with Ricoeur to get on the editorial board of Esprit, the best-known French journal on philosophy, and publish a few articles with very little impact.\n\nThe current president graduated in philosophy (he is also a finance inspector) with a thesis on Machiavelli, whose work he has not stopped reading. The “Jupiterian” tone of his presidency, in the most majestic sense of the term, and his predilection for results, rather than for theories and principles, are possibly related to his Machiavellian studies.\n\n“They say that Macron exercises power as an enlightened despot, which has its logic, because enlightened despotism is the system that is usually associated with the prince-philosopher,” said Francis Wolff, a professor emeritus of philosophy at Normal Sup and a world authority on Aristotle, in statements to the authors of The traitor and the void.\n\nThere is almost unanimous agreement in his close circle about Macron’s talent when it comes to reciting poetry. He has memorized thousands of verses, his delivery is strong and he uses the resources of an actor. If necessary, he can also sit down at the piano: he studied it for 10 years. On the whole, he has a much higher cultural veneer than is usual among heads of state and government. And he loves for people to notice it.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/KRW02FqOeEcLxlEDFjjIV-lyGF8=/1200x0/filters:focal(584x435:594x445)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/A4TNZCX3AVHXZPJVY7QFQO6ZHQ.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:09'}

Le Pen\'s result this time around was the best ever for the far right.\n\nMacron acknowledged some of the challenges he now faces in his victory speech Sunday night in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\n“Our country is beset by doubts and divisions,” he said. “Today’s vote requires us to consider all the hardships of people’s lives and to respond effectively to them and to the anger expressed.”\n\nThe French president has a long to-do list, ranging from preparing for key parliamentary elections in June to implementing his long-delayed pension reform plans and dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron also has to contend with an energised far left, many of whom backed far-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round and voted for the incumbent in the final round only to stop a far-right victory.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. Mélenchon’s France is not reconcilable with Le Pen’s, he said.

But she made clear she still had political ambitions.\n\nLe Pen said on Sunday she would "never abandon" the French and declared that she had scored a "brilliant victory" in her defeat.\n\nFor the upcoming parliamentary elections, her party has not formed an alliance with that of far-right rival Éric Zemmour, who scored 7 percent in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nSenior Le Pen aide Jean-Philippe Tanguy said Monday that Zemmour would have to acknowledge that she was the leader of the opposition.\n\nFrench parties look to win seats in June parliamentary election 01:40\n\nRelief among allies\n\nMacron will now try to implement his vision of more pro-business reforms and tighter EU integration after a first term overshadowed by protests, then the coronavirus pandemic and finally Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron\'s re-election sparked relief across Europe, where he has been seen as a guarantor of continuity.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news", European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said she was "delighted" and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters had "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nUS President Joe Biden, Canada\'s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Australian premier Scott Morrison also welcomed his win.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin – whom Macron had unsuccessfully sought to persuade to end the invasion of Ukraine – said Monday he wished the French president "success in your state activities, as well as good health and well-being".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Macron "a true friend of Ukraine".\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/07fd6986-c525-11ec-9a8a-005056bf8594/w:1280/p:16x9/macron-emotion.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:55'}

Its main policies of lowering the retirement age to 60 years, raising the minimum wage, price freezes and the ushering in of a “Sixth Republic” are not negotiable.\n\nLFI also wants its own candidates to be allowed to run in the number of constituencies that is proportional to its vote share in the presidentials. Then there’s a tricky question of how bound the coalition would be to European treaties.\n\nA handful of those are at odds with Mélenchon’s policy platform, which he says he wants to implement even if it means breaking EU rules.\n\nEuropean MP Yannick Jadot, who came third in the presidentials on the Europe-Ecologie Les Verts (EELV) greens party ticket, wants France to move towards more European integration.\n\nUnnamed EELV sources told BMFTV that Mélenchon’s demands were too great and risked “erasing” the platforms of other leftist parties altogether.\n\nJadot himself told France Inter radio on Tuesday that he was broadly in favour of a left-wing coalition, but not with Mélenchon as its leader.\n\n"We have such a responsibility on the climate," he said – adding the left needed a “very open" coalition that respected "the diversity and identity of its partners”.\n\nEELV’s own internal divisions – notably between Jadot and the party\'s national secretary Julien Bayou – may also prove a stumbling block to any future alliance.\n\nThe latter has conceded that time is running out and “the dice must be thrown this week” on the matter.\n\n.@yjadot : "Je soutiens la perspective d\'une coalition, qui doit être une coalition très ouverte.

Despite the paltry 1.75 percent of the vote managed by presidential hopeful Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists still enjoy a well-established local power base, with 28 lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nA representative of the Communist Party (PCF) told BFMTV that the “disrespectful” number of constituencies offered to them meant the jury was still out on their involvement in a possible coalition.\n\n"There is still too much uncertainty to say whether the Communists will accept this agreement or slam the door," the PCF member said.\n\nElsewhere, LFI is also in talks with the New Anti-Capitalist Party, which has responded favourably and has been openly pushing LFI’s notion that the June polls represent a "third round” of the presidential contest.\n\nAll 577 deputy seats in the lower house will be up for grabs on 12 and 19 June, with LREM likely to meet stiff resistance.

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us. Tonight we tell them that we will continue to transform Europe by their side”, she added.\n\nWhile Macron received many congratulations from his European counterparts, he acknowledged his victory was not as self-evident as last time.\n\n“Many of our compatriots voted for me, not to support the ideas I put forward, but to block the extreme right”, he told the crowd, thanking them and committing to address these divisions.\n\n“Our challenge is to restore French unity. The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

At the same time, most age groups were split more evenly between Macron and Le Pen; the only group that went all out for the incumbent president were the 18-to-24-year-olds. Yes, Generation Z, the post-millennials, saved Macron. And not so much because of their outpouring love for the president, but out of their fear of the alternative.\n\nThe French presidential election system was set up this way by President Charles de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic. The two-round system (no one gets 51% of the votes in the first round) often forces a second-round competition between a centrist and an extremist candidate, and the majority always prefers the centrist. Next, France will have a parliamentary election and the reelected Macron will campaign for the voters to give his party the majority so that his premiere would be from his own party and not, embarrassingly, from the opposition. He’ll get that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo, how come, on Monday morning, the euro fell 0.34% against the dollar, to $1.07725, close to its two-year low last week? Reuters suggested investors may be relieved to see that Le Pen is not in office, but this doesn’t mean they have high expectations of the winner. Still, the nationalist Le Pen promised to nationalize some key parts of France’s industry, cut taxes radically, and curtail France’s participation in the EU budget. The nightmare is over, investors, what’s holding y’all back?\n\nTurns out the future of the world’s economy is mired in anxiety: US stocks are not performing; futures are declining; China is being revisited by the pandemic it may have invented, so large chunks of its workforce are under lockdowns; supply chains are getting bogged down even worse than before; and Putin continues to try to salvage some measure of victory over Ukraine in time for May 9, the anniversary of the Red Army’s victory over the Nazis.\n\nThe dollar roared over in Israel, too, where it struck NIS 3.27 for the first time in who knows how long. It has probably more to do with the Fed raising interest rates recently than with French politics, but it couldn’t come at a better time, when Israel is struggling to retool its economy and restart its lavish exports again.\n\nMost French Jews heaved a sigh of relief over Macron’s win, especially Orthodox Jews – who would normally align with the right-wing candidate. The reason is that Le Pen, despite her cosmetic efforts, is more an old-fashion fascist than a modern-day extreme right-winger. As part of her fierce anti-immigration (some say xenophobic) policy, she promised to ban animal slaughter without stunning, insisting that stunning the animal is more humane. Of course, stunning renders the animal as “traif” for both Jews and Muslims, who threatened that they would leave France if they were deprived of their kosher and halal meat (If Le Pen Wins, She’ll Ban Kosher Shechita in France).\n\nAnd since France exports kosher meat, a ban on its production in France would have had a devastating impact on Jewish communities elsewhere, most notably in neighboring Switzerland.\n\nMany right-wing Israelis didn’t see a big distinction between Macron and Le Pen because both support the two-state solution and a Palestinian state. But if that’s your litmus test, then most Western and Third-World countries should be classified as anti-Israel. I thought Macron stood out as a friend a couple of weeks ago, when he clashed with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, calling him a “far-right antisemite.” So Emanuel can’t be all bad.\n\nHere’s what happened: Morawiecki compared the French president’s phone calls with Vladimir Putin to negotiating with Hitler. Now, you may support Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine or be against them, but they just don’t compare with what Hitler did to most of Europe and the rest of the planet. In response, Macron told Le Parisien that Morawiecki was trying to help Le Pen, and called him a “far-right antisemite who bans LGBT persons” in his country.\n\nA spokesman for Morawiecki said it was a lie and the Polish PM wasn’t an antisemite. But he kind of is. In 2018 he said Jews were involved in perpetrating the Holocaust (which would have been a brilliant solution to the supply chain problems). And Morawiecki is also behind the Polish law that punishes anyone who blames Poles for taking part in the Nazi Holocaust crimes.\n\nAnd, in June 2021, after Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called the new Polish law barring Jews from filing Holocaust restitution claims in Poland “immoral,” PM Morawiecki said, “I can only say that as long as I am the prime minister, Poland will not pay for German crimes: Neither zloty, nor euro, nor dollar.”\n\nSee? It always comes down to economics.

The centre has held. Yesterday (24 April), 2022 stopped being 2022 just long enough for Emmanuel Macron to see off Marine Le Pen and secure re-election as the president of France. The result came as a great relief to millions around the world.\n\n\n\nMany are tempted to try and read into the result some grander narrative in which Europe remains a sort of liberal Hyperborea, a paradise from which the British expelled themselves in 2016 (together with Americans in electing Donald Trump). On closer inspection, however, this conception doesn’t quite square with the bald reality: the Rassemblement National (RN), a party explicitly rooted in the post-fascist far right, has just taken 41 per cent of the second-round vote in one of the European Union’s most important member states.\n\nAdmirers in Britain have long been prepared to overlook the unfortunate truth that France is home to one of the world’s largest white far-right parties. While Macron might have won yesterday’s election, the trend of the far right is only upward in France. Back in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, first broke through to contest the second round of the presidential election, French voters united around Jacques Chirac and rejected the Front National (as the RN was known at the time) by more than four to one. The elder Le Pen took less than 18 per cent of the second-round vote. Yet in 2017, his daughter Marine won more than 33 per cent – and yesterday, she won 41 per cent. Furthermore, while in Britain even the respectable right has serious trouble wooing younger voters, polling by YouGov has suggested that in France the RN is ahead with voters aged 18-24, as well as winning voters directly from the far left.\n\nFrance is not the only EU country to display this trend, however: there are plenty of other correctives for anyone who, despairing of the UK’s current government, might pine for a lost Eden across the English Channel. Across southern Europe the long political legacy of the EU’s tough response to the financial crisis plays out in the rise of right-wing parties that, like the RN, harbour more or less explicit links to historical anti-democratic movements. Italy not only contains the populist party Lega Nord but its smaller ally Fratelli d’Italia, whose logo features the familiar tricoloured flame of the postwar far right.\n\nRelated\n\nIn Spain meanwhile, Vox, a party with Francoist undertones, has outflanked Madrid’s traditional parties of the right on the question of Spanish unity, and secured its first beachhead in government. In eastern Europe, there is the organised, multinational challenge of the Visegrád Group; while in wealthy northern Europe, the social democratic Danish government recently adopted what Foreign Policy called “one of the harshest refugee policies in the world”.\n\nIn contrast, despite the performative toughness of the Rwanda proposals, the United Kingdom operates what the statistics show to be a pretty liberal immigration regime. Whatever its flaws, no sober observer can conflate the Conservative Party with the far-right movements gaining ground on the continent.\n\nNone of this is proof that Brexit was a good idea, of course, nor that France and Europe are not home to real liberal achievements. But we should accept that a country in which Le Pen takes 40 per cent of the vote is no nirvana.', 'image': 'https://www.newstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1236459286-1038x778.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:50'}

Faced with the prospect of a far-right takeover of the Élysée, a sufficient number of voters put aside their reservations regarding Emmanuel Macron and made him the first president to win a second term in office for 20 years. In the end, Mr Macron’s 58%-42% victory over Marine Le Pen was much more comfortable than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when some polls predicted a knife-edge contest.\n\nFor France – and the rest of Europe – the alternative outcome would have been disastrous and destabilising. Ms Le Pen’s authoritarian, nationalist and xenophobic vision would have led to civil strife domestically and undermined solidarity between western democracies at a vital time. That Mr Macron successfully averted this worst-case scenario is a cause for celebration. But as his victory speech on Sunday night tacitly acknowledged, an election won with the help of the fear factor has delivered an exceptionally fragile mandate. Describing France as riven by doubt and division, Mr Macron pledged to be “not the candidate of one camp, but the president of all of us”. Such assurances are commonplace from victorious political leaders, but it is vital that Mr Macron makes good on them during a second term, which looks challenging to say the least.\n\nAs the election laid bare, France is dangerously divided along economic and generational fault lines. A majority of blue-collar workers – and more than four in 10 voters overall – opted for Ms Le Pen. This, the best score in the history of the French far right, allowed Ms Le Pen to declare her share of the vote a “victory in itself”. Disturbingly, it indicates that the normalisation of her movement is all but complete. Mr Macron’s core vote, by contrast, came from wealthy business people, middle-class professionals and retired people. Younger, well educated but economically precarious voters who supported the radical left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round were left without a dog in the fight.\n\nReflecting widespread disillusionment with the choice on offer, particularly among the young, the rate of abstention was the highest for a presidential runoff since 1969. Among potential voters under the age of 25, more than 40% failed to cast a ballot. Enough voters on the left lent their support to Mr Macron to keep the far right out of power, but in fewer numbers than in 2017. Hostilities on the right and the left will now be resumed ahead of parliamentary elections in June.\n\nIf he is to successfully navigate this volatile political landscape, Mr Macron will need to adopt a radically different playbook from the one that characterised his first five years in the Élysée. During that time, he acquired a reputation as the “president of the rich” after watering down a wealth tax, pursuing unpopular pension reforms and imposing a fuel tax that sparked the gilets jaunes movement. An autocratic style contributed to the widespread impression that Mr Macron’s declared intention to transform and liberalise the French economy would be accomplished at the expense of the less well-off.\n\nTo make good on his aspirations to reach out across the divides, Mr Macron will need to do far more to address such concerns and insecurities. During a campaign that became unexpectedly close, there were signs that this was being recognised. In an encouraging early statement of intent, it has already been signalled that there will be full consultation with unions and other bodies over proposals to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, in a still fragile post-Covid economy, Mr Macron should also recognise that more needs to be done to protect and improve the living standards of blue-collar workers and the youthful precariat, which voted en masse for Mr Mélenchon. As he contemplates five more years in office, Mr Macron must realise that he has been given not so much a mandate as another chance.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f9dc305d6b01ad6e862da6d17afc1f0e1d372f/0_0_4625_2774/master/4625.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4f9959a701f15dfce678c4ac1137a3cd', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:42'}

But this flattering score falls to 38.52% of the electorate, i.e. the registered voters. In other words, nearly two thirds of the French did not vote Macron.

Here is France cut into small pieces, like a puzzle. If it is true that the first round revealed the tri-polarization of French political life, the second round shows us a France of the elites against a France of the people, a France of the big cities against a France of the rural areas, a France of the “bobos”, happy and rich, and a France of the eternally forgotten, of the poor (there are 10 million of them) who can neither find decent housing, nor heat, nor food, nor entertainment.\n\nIn these conditions, how can one be the president “of all the French”?

Berlin has not only hit the brakes when it comes to EU sanctions, but its refusal to supply heavy weapons to Ukraine has also reduced its leadership potential.\n\n“I think Germany has to be content now with playing at best the second, maybe even the third role in Europe. And that, of course, is partly due to the dithering and hesitation of Chancellor Olaf Scholz,” Vöpel said.\n\nAt the same time, the war has also exposed the weaknesses of its policies of the last few decades that concern Russia.\n\nWhile France always warned against too much economic dependence on Russia – especially concerning the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – Germany’s Russia policy was driven by the attempt to bring Russia closer to the West through closer economic integration. This approach has largely failed, considering Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Germany is also much more isolated than France in other areas. Macron, for example, has sought a close alliance with his Italian counterpart, Mario Draghi, on reforming European debt rules.\n\n“Particularly in the face of the current crises, Macron will try to work with Draghi to push for increased financial leeway to be able to shoulder the necessary investments,” emphasised Vöpel.\n\nAlthough Germany, in particular, has been hesitant to support the reform and the loosening of the EU’s fiscal rules, the balance of power in Europe has shifted toward the reform of rules, he added.\n\nGerman position in the EU\n\nHowever, Germany’s positions now coincide with Macron’s visions in many areas, most notably the attempt to foster European sovereignty.\n\nWhile Macron’s calls for a sovereign Europe in his keynote speech at the Sorbonne in 2017 were mainly left unanswered by the German government, the issue is now also topping the agenda in Germany. Scholz’s Zeitenwende is already profoundly anchored in German discourse and goes beyond the Ukraine war’s immediate effects.\n\nLast Wednesday, for example, Finance Minister Christian Lindner called for a complete strategic reset of German policy.\n\n“We have placed ourselves at a triple risk. We have become too dependent when it comes to energy from Russia, security from the U.S. and business with China,” Lindner told Focus Online. As a result, he said, Germany must now “re-found its business model.”\n\nGerman SPD MEP Udo Bullmann also stressed to EURACTIV that it was now necessary to strengthen European sovereignty.\n\nWhat is needed now is “a European policy full of self-confidence, but also full of clear objectives of peacekeeping, the international role of the European Union, and a new economic and development model in the face of climate change,” Bullmann said.\n\nMeanwhile, CEP Paris Director Marc Uzan also expressed confidence in the German ability to change.\n\n“Germany is at a turning point, and I think Berlin will be up to the challenge,” he told EURACTIV.\n\nAccording to him, France could also play a key role for Germany in this political upheaval.\n\n“Marcon could be the bridge to help Germany change its growth model and maybe its geopolitical model too,” Uzan stressed.\n\n[Edited by Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57538786-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

The future of Europe lies in our hands. Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his victory!”.\n\nThe opposition tried to link Le Pen’s defeat to the Polish conservative PiS government, which has clashed with Brussels over the rule of law. During the migration crisis with Belarus, Macron had told the Polish prime minister that the EU would stand by them but would not overlook the rule of law concerns.\n\n“A day will come that we will have Paris in Warsaw”, opposition centrist leader Donald Tusk (Civic Platform) said.\n\nThe topic of Russia was very present in politicians’ reactions.\n\n“Thanks to Macron’s victory, there will be more Europe in Europe […] And less Russia”, Tusk added.\n\nCentre-right lawmaker Jarosław Gowin (Porozumienie party) said Macron saved France from the pro-Putin Le Pen while the “hopes of PiS leaders to build a strong Eurosceptic bloc are dashed. The next congress of the leaders of the populist right will be a congress of losers.”\n\n“A victory for Marine Le Pen would be a victory for the vision of a Europe of selfish states, of which the Kremlin would be most happy,” commented Władysław Kosiniak – Kamysz, a lawmaker for the centrist/agrarian Polish People’s Party.\n\n“France and Europe defended by Emmanuel Macron against hatred, backwardness, and Putin,” tweeted Maciej Gdula, a social-democratic lawmaker from the New Left.\n\nIn Prague, which will soon take over from France the EU Council rotating presidency, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala (ODS, ECR) said France is a “vital partner”, while Czech Parliament’s speaker Markéta Pekarová Adamová (TOP 09, EPP) said populism and nationalism have lost and that France will continue to be a partner in the EU and NATO.\n\nIn Slovakia, Defence Minister Jaroslav Naď (OĽaNO) stated Macron’s re-election is “excellent news for whole democratic world”, stressing the clear stance of Macron towards Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nIn Hungary, so far, there has been no official government reaction.\n\nEuropean federalist MEP Dobrev Klára from Democratic Coalition (DK) hailed Macron’s victory, while “Viktor Orban’s ally and friend in the region, Janez Janša, and his populist right-wing Slovenian Democratic Party lost the elections […] Both is great news for Europe’s friends”.\n\nThe German message\n\n“Your voters have also sent a strong message of commitment to Europe today,” German chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Twitter. During this election, finance minister Christian Lindner added that France was standing at the crossroads, stressing that “the united Europe is the biggest winner of this election.”\n\nHowever, the strong result of Le Pen has prompted concern. Ahead of Macron now lies the task of “rallying the French people, who voted strongly for right-wing and left-wing populists in this round of elections, probably out of disappointment, behind the political centre again,” Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesperson of the conservative CDU told EURACTIV.\n\nThe result is a “serious reminder” to the French president that “France now needs a social and ecological renewal” as France is facing “deep social divides,” a senior Social Democrat, MEP Udo Bullmann, told EURACTIV.\n\n“Emmanuel Macron’s election victory was more important for Europe than the German federal election. France has voted against right-wing populism and resentment and favoured President Macron’s Europe,” chancellor candidate for the CDU/CSU in 2021, Armin Laschet, told EURACTIV.\n\nAustrian and Dutch leaders also focused on the pro-EU signal of Macron’s victory.\n\nIn Rome, Madrid, Lisbon and Athens, leaders highlighted France’s commitment to the European project.\n\nIn Italy, Lega leader Matteo Salvini congratulated Le Pen, tweeting: “Congratulations, Marine! Alone against everyone, coherent and smiling, you have gathered the vote of 13 million French people, an unprecedented rate. Together for a Europe based on work, family, security, rights and freedom”.\n\nGreek MEP Stelios Kouloglou told EURACTIV that all polls show that disadvantaged French people support the far-right candidate as they feel marginalised by the political and social system. “Far-right demagogues are all over Europe are waiting if the problems of the vast majority are not solved.”\n\n“Five years is very little in history. In France, the next match may have very unpleasant surprises. For now, France and the EU are saved. But until when?” he wondered.', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/main-lead-800x450.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:27'}

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

Police used tear gas to disperse gatherings in Paris and the western city of Rennes.\n\n- New era -\n\nIn a victory speech on the Champ de Mars in central Paris at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, Macron vowed to respond to the anger of voters who backed his far-right rival, saying his new term would not continue unchanged from the last five years.\n\n"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right," he told thousands of cheering supporters.\n\n"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me."\n\nHe also pledged a "renewed method" to govern France, adding that this "new era" would not be one of "continuity with the last term which is now ending".\n\nIn a combative speech to supporters in Paris in which she accepted the result but showed no sign of quitting politics, Le Pen, 53, said she would "never abandon" the French and was already preparing for the June legislative elections.\n\n"The result represents a brilliant victory," she said to cheers.\n\n"This evening, we launched the great battle for the legislative elections," Le Pen said, adding that she felt "hope" and calling on opponents of the president to join with her National Rally (RN) party.\n\n- \'Count on France\' -\n\nThe result is narrower than the second-round clash in 2017, when the same two candidates met in the run-off and Macron polled over 66 percent of the vote.\n\nFor Le Pen, her third defeat in presidential polls will be a bitter pill to swallow after she plowed years of effort into making herself electable and distancing her party from the legacy of its founder, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nCritics insisted her party never stopped being extreme-right and racist while Macron repeatedly pointed to her plan to ban the wearing of the Muslim headscarf in public if elected.\n\nThe projections caused immense relief in Europe after fears a Le Pen presidency would leave the continent rudderless following Brexit and the departure from politics of German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news for all of Europe" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nEU president Charles Michel said the bloc could now "count on France for five more years" while Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also congratulated him, saying she was "delighted to be able to continue our excellent cooperation".\n\nIn another election Sunday, Slovenia\'s three-time Prime Minister Janez Jansa, criticized by opponents as an authoritarian right-wing populist, was at risk of losing power to a party led by political newcomer Robert Golob.\n\n- \'Ocean of abstention\' -\n\nMacron will be hoping for a less complicated second term that will allow him to implement his vision of more pro-business reform and tighter EU integration, after a first term shadowed by protests, then the pandemic and finally Russia\'s military operation in Ukraine.\n\nBut he will have to win over those who backed his opponents and the millions of French who did not bother to vote.\n\nPolling organizations estimated turnout of just 72 percent, the lowest in any presidential election second-round run-off since 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, according to partial results, 6.45 percent of voters in the election voted for neither candidate in blank ballots while 2.35 percent spoilt their papers.\n\nThe hard-left third-placed candidate in the first round, Jean-Luc Melenchon, had refused to endorse Macron.\n\nHe has his eyes firmly set on the June elections.\n\nMelenchon welcomed Le Pen\'s defeat as "very good news for the unity of our people" but said Le Pen and Macron had barely managed to win a third of support from registered voters.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots", he said.', 'image': 'https://cdnimgen.royanews.tv/imageserv/Size728Q40/news/20220425/35368.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:44'}

And so do U.S. voters in general, not just Republicans. Nearly 60 percent of those who participated in a recent Gallup poll said there was too much immigration into the country. That makes anti-immigrant sentiment mainstream. Le Pen\'s platform also proposed that non-citizen immigrants arrested for any crime be sent back to their country of origin. This fringe position in France is the law of the land in America and has been for years.\n\n"They\'re bringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime. They\'re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," Donald Trump said on the day in 2015 that he announced he was running for president. During his tenure in office, Trump took many different steps to limit immigration, and not just the illegal sort. In fact, in 2020, he reduced the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. by 49 percent.\n\nWhat puts Le Pen and the National Rally Party in the far-right corner of politics, then? Like her near-fascist father before her, Le Pen isn\'t fond of immigrants, and I mean really not fond . She wants them to assimilate to French culture to the point where they would be indistinguishable from France\'s original immigrants (or rather, invaders), the Germanic Franks, who came for a visit to the Roman Empire in the 4th century and never went away. But even more than assimilating, Le Pen and her party would much rather immigrants just go back to where they came from.\n\nAnalysts all over the world woke up on Monday morning to mourn the fact that far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen wasn\'t beaten soundly enough, even though she lost by more than 16 points to a man few people in France apparently love , the incumbent Emmanuel Macron.\n\nNational Rally is also famously skeptical of international alliances, especially those with NATO and the European Union. France is one of the founding members of the EU, and along with Germany, forms its heart. For France to leave the Union would gut it, and possibly bring an end to the "European project" of peace and economic cooperation for the continent. But such actions don\'t send a shudder down the spine of Americans; Trump for his part killed a major trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, threatened to undo America\'s free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, pulled out of the Paris climate treaty, and came closer than we ever knew to essentially pulling the U.S. out of NATO — all to the applause of many Republicans.\n\nTrump was not standing out in the cold on the issue of NATO, either. Before the war in Ukraine, only 48 percent of Americans thought the organization was doing a good job, and a full 65 percent of Republicans thought it was doing a poor job. If France is the heart of the EU, the U.S. simply is NATO. The U.S. founded the alliance and provides a shield for the other members that fall under the American aegis. This may change, thanks Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s war in Ukraine, which has forced Europe to rethink its role in its own defense, but as of right now, U.S. leadership is clear and unquestioned.\n\nAnd speaking of the war in Ukraine and Russia in general, Le Pen and Trump share something else: A love for Putin. Over and over, Trump praised Putin for his intelligence, strength, and the high quality of his negotiating tactics. He even asked for Russia to help him get dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, which is widely believed to have been tainted by Russian interference, both online and off. Le Pen is also deeply tied to Putin, speaking warmly of the autocrat while her National Rally happily took Russian money. She has praised Putin\'s nationalism and skepticism of globalization.\n\nLe Pen\'s economic policies are not a one-to-one correlation with those in the GOP — this is France after all, so some "socialism" on health care and other issues are required — but the fear of corporate globalism is exactly the same. Trump\'s "America First" economics fit very well with Le Pen\'s ideas.\n\nOn social issues, National Rally had to moderate several positions to become competitive in France. Gay marriage and abortion play their part in the political process over there, just as they do here, and Le Pen had to loosen up. The difference here is that America\'s far-right is succeeding in protecting the "traditional values" of the Dark Ages.\n\nSo could Le Pen be elected in America? No, she\'s a foreigner. But as far as her positions go, there\'s very little to bar a politician like her. We\'ve already voted for people on the local and national levels who make Le Pen practically look like a liberal. Even her position that Muslims should not be allowed to wear headscarves in public places, while extreme, falls in line with overall American feelings about Muslims.\n\nEven now, as President Biden is being praised elsewhere in the world for rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and reaffirming America\'s commitment to NATO, there are viable presidential candidates waiting in the wings to undo that work. And even if they don\'t win in 2024, chances are they\'ll be a lot closer to the White House than 16 points behind.', 'image': 'https://mediacloud.theweek.com/image/upload/s--X-WVjvBW--/f_auto,t_content-image-full-desktop@1/v1650910407/Trump le pen.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

These are set to alter further the balance of power between the Socialists and the Republicains who have already imploded and are struggling to survive.\n\nInstead, the main opponents of Macron’s liberal, centrist La République En Marche are Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s far-left La France Insoumise and Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement national.\n\nWhat are the possible scenarios?\n\nAn “unlikely” far-right or far-left majority\n\nAccording to Thanassis Diamantopoulos, professor of political science at the University of Athens and expert on the French regime, the hypothesis of a far-right or far-left majority in the National Assembly is “unlikely”, despite the historically high scores of Le Pen and Mélenchon’s parties.\n\nIn France, the two-round majoritarian single-member electoral system means that “even with a majority, the far right and far left cannot win parliamentary elections. […] They have no potential to form an alliance”, and it is easier for “the forces around the centre to form an alliance”, Diamantopoulos told EURACTIV France.\n\nBut in recent days, Mélenchon has unequivocally called on his supporters: “I ask you to elect me Prime minister”.\n\nBetween the fact that “there will be no defections” in favour of Mélenchon’s party and the “under-representation of the extremes”, the possibility that his appeal will become a reality in the ballot box remains dim.\n\nAnother element that works against the most radical parties is that “there are two ‘anti-system’ expressions, one on the far right and the other on the left”.\n\nFor these reasons, eight deputies were elected under the banner of the Rassemblement National in 2017, despite qualifying for the second round of the presidential election, and Mélenchon’s party had seventeen. These results are far below the overall results at the national level.\n\nThe (new) attempt to unite the left\n\nOn the left, the urgent need for unity is being felt both by executives and voters, in order to regain influence and hope to impose a social and ecological majority on Macron.\n\nContacted by EURACTIV France, Sylvie Guillaume, a Socialist MEP, said she hoped that “the legislative elections [will make it possible to] restore a better balance because the presidential election is not a blank check” for the newly re-elected president.\n\nThe same is true of the Insoumis — Mélenchon’s supporters — who want to believe in uniting the left.\n\nMEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV France that her movement “appeals to those who do not feel represented” and admits to being in discussion with the other left-wing forces, to agree on “a common base”.\n\nThe call of Mélenchon and his supporters seem to have been heard by the other left-wing movements. Europe Ecologie Les Verts MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV France that “the political forces of the left and the ecologists must organise themselves to weigh together if they do not want to condemn themselves to lose separately”.\n\nLéon Deffontaines, president of the young communists’ movement, told EURACTIV France he hoped to see “the ideas of equality, sharing and solidarity become the majority again”.\n\nCommunist candidate Fabien Roussel pleaded on Sunday evening for a “global agreement” of the left, demanding that “local anchors and different sensibilities on the left be taken into account” in order to avoid the distribution benefiting only La France Insoumise, which largely dominated the left in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nYet, according to Diamantopoulos, even if “some constituencies [the left] could get some MPs elected” the idea of “getting close to a parliamentary majority is a political fiction”.\n\nWhat majority for Macron?\n\nDespite the parliamentary challenges, Macron will not throw in the towel.\n\nJudging by the comments of Gabriel Attal, spokesman for the outgoing government, confidence in Macron’s camp remains high.\n\n“I am convinced that the French will give the president of the republic the means to act to protect them, with a majority [in the National Assembly],” Attal told BFMTV-RMC on Monday morning.\n\nHaving limited manoeuvring room due to a lack of partisan alliances beyond the existing majority, Macron’s camp will try to convince voters of other political inclinations or, at best, conclude circumstantial agreements in the territories where this is possible.\n\nDiamantopoulos believes Macron could build a “presidential majority that would start with the former Gaullists (centre-right Républicains) and reach the hinge of the left, including perhaps even a part of the Socialist Party and, of course, the ecologists”.\n\nMacron must therefore, according to Diamantopoulos, “wink at the ecologists” the day after the election. His promise to appoint a prime minister “in charge of ecological planning” would be a step in this direction.\n\nBut the question is: when will this appointment take place? Diamantopoulos warned that this plan could be changed, depending on the results of the legislative elections, which will tilt the future government more to the right or the left, and thus define Macron’s alliance choices.\n\nAs a reminder, in 2017 he chose Edouard Philippe from the centre-right as prime minister, even though he was not forced to do so, having acquired a solid majority in the Assembly, as well as several other ministers from the right.\n\nAt the same time, Macron will also have to devote some of his energy to the French EU presidency.\n\n“He needs to ensure the ongoing French EU presidency is a success. It ends on June 30 and there is an upcoming conference on the Western Balkans to be organised soon, which provides an opportunity to start rethinking the EU’s enlargement policy,” Tara Varma of the European Council on Foreign Relations told EURACTIV in emailed comments.\n\n“Macron will have to take the mantle of European diplomatic leadership again. He mentioned Ukraine in his victory speech. He should travel to Kyiv immediately with (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz to demonstrate Europe’s support for Ukraine,” she said.\n\nBig relief after Macron's re-election but 'third round' ahead French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to unite a deeply divided nation after winning re-election on Sunday (24 April) in a battle against rival Marine Le Pen that saw the far right come its closest yet to taking power.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]", 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57636418-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nMacron loses the French territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost 3 million.\n\nLe Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nMacron could only claim victory in the Pacific islands such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris.

On Sunday, the sitting French president defeated Le Pen with 58.5 percent of the vote — provoking a sigh of relief from many environmental activists, despite their quarrels with Macron during his previous 5-year term.\n\nLe Pen’s energy plan had called for exiting the European Union’s electricity market, accelerating the development of nuclear power, and establishing a moratorium on wind and solar development. (Nuclear currently provides about 70 percent of the country’s electricity; wind and solar combined provide only about 10 percent.) “Wind turbines are ugly and they ruin our landscapes,” Le Pen said in the April 20 debate. The far-right candidate had also vowed to cut the value-added tax on gas, electricity, and oil from 20 percent to 5.5 percent — a move that would have cost the government up to 12 billion euros (nearly $12.9 billion) and boosted demand for fossil fuels.\n\nGrist relies on the support of generous readers like you to keep our climate news free.

Here's How\n\nThe president’s climate policies could also spill over into neighboring European countries. France is currently the leader of the European Union Council, which is tasked with implementing Europe’s “Green Deal” — a massive spending package designed to help the continent get off fossil fuels. And Macron has been one of the most outspoken critics of using Russian coal and oil in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, calling for an outright blockade on the import of those fuels into the E.U. “The results of elections in France always reverberate way beyond the country’s borders,” Lucie Mattera, head of European politics at the think tank E3G, told E&E News last week. “And 2022 is no exception.”\n\nBut critics have argued that the president struggled to implement his climate agenda during his first term. After promising to cut emissions in his first presidential election, in 2017, Macron instituted increases in France’s fuel tax, with the aim of reducing emissions from the transportation sector. The resulting price hike sparked the gilet jaunes, or “yellow vests” movement, with hundreds of thousands of French citizens protesting in the streets.\n\nChagrined, Macron repealed the tax increases and launched a program of public participation in government — including a Citizens’ Convention on Climate, a randomly selected group of 150 voters tasked with helping the country create new climate policy. The president promised to pass their proposals on to the legislature or to a referendum “without filter” — but there, too, he ran into conflict. After the convention released its 149 proposals, Macron preemptively vetoed three of them, including a tax on corporate profits to fund clean energy. Only a few dozen of the citizens’ suggestions ended up in France’s sweeping 2021 climate law, and those often in watered-down form.\n\nIn the short term, the reelected president has promised to create a new prime minister position focused on “ecological planning” and increase investments in renewable technologies. Part of that may be an act of political expediency: Macron was shifted left during the campaign by the popular primary run of the leftist candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who attracted many young voters with his calls for a 200 billion euro ($214 billion) investment in green infrastructure and a constitutional amendment to protect biodiversity. The support for Mélenchon, Macron said in a speech last week, had sent a “powerful message.”", 'image': 'https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron_election_presidential_climate.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France.

He is the teenager who fell in love with a 39-year-old teacher and was loved back in return, the Rothschild banker, the man who betrayed former president François Hollande, the pianist, the technocrat, the lover of poetry and theater, and the seducer. This is the portrait of Emmanuel Macron, 44, in four acts:\n\nThe man\n\nEmmanuel Macron was born in Amiens on December 21, 1977, the son of Jean-Michel, a doctor and professor of neurology, and Françoise, a general practitioner. He was the oldest of three brothers.\n\nThe man and the character were born 15 years later, towards the end of 1992, when the schoolboy fell in love with Brigitte Auzière, born Brigitte Trogneux, his French and drama teacher. The love was reciprocated. The teacher was 39 years old, married to a well-known local banker, and one of her daughters was Emmanuel’s classmate.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the impact of such an unconventional (and currently criminal) relationship in a relatively small, provincial city like Amiens, with a population of around 130,000. Brigitte’s family owned the most famous bakery in town. Emmanuel’s parents were doctors. They all knew each other. The Macrons tried to end the matter by sending their son to Paris. It was useless: Brigitte separated and visited Emmanuel on weekends. For her, Emmanuel was “a Mozart,” a boy who dazzled her with his intelligence and maturity. For him, Brigitte meant and still means everything.\n\nStill a minor, Emmanuel Macron broke with his family and with his hometown. He and Brigitte took on the world. It remains an indestructible union. The current president of France does not have great friends or confidants: Brigitte is enough for him. Without Brigitte, Macron cannot be understood.\n\nSeveral people who know Macron (as far as it is possible to know someone who is essentially hermetic) agree that he is a man who lives out his life as a fictional character, in search of increasingly sensational challenges and adventures. That craving is likely related to the taboo that was broken in 1992.\n\n“I think he would have liked to be a writer or an actor, and he applies his dramatic talent to politics as well as to his own life,” says Gaspard Gantzer, who was his classmate at the National School of Administration and then at the Elysée Palace: Macron was an adviser to president François Hollande, Gantzer was the press officer.\n\nMacron is a seducer capable of charming almost anyone. He sleeps very little, his memory is extraordinary and his capacity for work almost unlimited. “We are talking about a very, very brilliant man,” says Manuel Valls, France’s prime minister when Macron was economy minister.\n\n“He knows how to be cold when it suits him and he maintains his cool at all times, but he tends to take a positive approach to things and is capable of being very thoughtful and caring,” says Gantzer. All the people consulted agree in underlining two virtues of Macron: physical courage, which has more than once made him face hostile crowds (and get out of it thanks to his charm), and audacity. He was a good corporate banker at Rothschild. In that job, he learned to take risks and jump at any opportunity.\n\n"Where others see charm and friendliness, I have failed to see anything other than superficiality and narcissism," says a conservative politician who prefers not to be quoted.\n\nThe traitor\n\nEmmanuel Macron is haunted by the shadow of Eugène de Rastignac, the most famous social climber in French literature. Rastignac appears in several novels by Honoré de Balzac: he is a hustler who prospers in finances thanks to his lover’s husband; he marries his lover’s daughter and achieves a good position in Parisian society. “All politicians have something of Rastignac,” concedes Manuel Valls. “And the French system favors personality-driven ventures.”\n\nMacron, during his campaign trip to Marseille, on April 16. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nValls, who after serving as French prime minister later became a city councilor in Barcelona (he is a dual Spanish-French citizen), was one of the victims of the great conspiracy developed by Macron from inside the Élysée. He had fierce clashes with his economy minister and went to great lengths to convince then-president François Hollande to remove Macron from the palace. It was useless: Hollande fell under Macron’s spell until “the methodical betrayal” of his protégé, in Hollande’s own words, became evident. It was already too late.\n\nLe traître et le néant (or The traitor and the void), the book on Emmanuel Macron written by journalists Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme, confirms over and over again that Emmanuel Macron’s ability to fascinate is multiplied with older men and greater power. As soon as he left the National School of Administration, Macron successfully sought the protection of the most powerful men of the Republic: Jacques Attali and Alain Minc, two president-makers. It was Minc who procured him a job at the Rothschild Bank, so that he could amass wealth before devoting himself to politics. And it was Attali who brought him close to the Socialist Party and François Hollande.\n\nDuring Hollande’s presidency, first as an adviser and then as a minister, Emmanuel Macron played his own game. Luck helped him, as always: the strokes of fortune of the current president of France are legendary. When he was about to leave the Élysée for a well-paid teaching position, for example, a stroke of luck led him to the Ministry of Economy. In addition to luck, boldness and an amazing ability to deceive also played a role.\n\nMacron used all the resources of the ministry to weave a dense network of contacts. During his last eight months in office, Macron spent €120,000 on dinners held at the ministerial residence, an imposing glass-enclosed apartment facing the Seine. Some nights there were two dinner shifts with different diners. And a third shift was added at La Rotonde, the Macrons’ favorite brasserie.\n\nMacron was creating En Marche! (the name was chosen by Brigitte because she liked it and the initials coincided with those of her husband) and he repeatedly assured Hollande that it was a political club intended to support his re-election. Instead, together with a group of moderate socialists who felt orphaned by the fall of long-time party heavyweight Dominique Strauss-Kahn (the fall from grace of DSK after being accused of rape was one of Macron’s lucky breaks), Macron was in fact boycotting Hollande and actually preparing his own race for the presidency. The documents were burned in a stove. There was absolute secrecy.\n\nMacron destroyed the options of Hollande and Valls from within. Finally, he announced that he was not a socialist, forced his own dismissal and embarked on the campaign to become president of France.\n\nThe politician\n\nLike a corporate banker, Emmanuel Macron launched a takeover bid (after long secret preparations) for the Socialist Party. The initial core of En Marche! was made up of socialists disappointed by François Hollande, the president who wanted to be “normal” and ended up being irrelevant. Once the main party on the left had been dismantled, he captured very prominent figures from The Republicans, the great Gaullist party on the right. “He was the first to guess that the classic parties had collapsed, that the system was in a state of crisis,” says Manuel Valls.\n\nPerhaps Macron’s first presidential adventure would have failed if Alain Juppé had won the primaries of The Republicans. But François Fillon prevailed, a candidate whose campaign frayed when it was discovered that his wife received a salary without working and that he was irregularly financing his high lifestyle. Another stroke of luck: big banking and big industry abandoned Fillon and turned to Macron.\n\n“There is something Napoleonic in Macron’s brilliant career, he knew how to take risks at the right time and people followed him,” summarizes Valls, who in recent times has gotten closer to his old enemy. As soon as he found out that his rival in the second round would be far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, Macron already felt like a president. And he held a big party at La Rotonde, which was premature according to some and inappropriate according to others, because back then it was considered a disgrace for the far right to even reach the second round of voting.\n\nNobody considers that Macron’s five-year term has been a success. Macron has shown that he knows a lot about France, but very little about the French. La République en Marche, the presidential version of En Marche!, is not a party, but rather a group of clappers dazzled by their leader. The absence of internal criticism, the small role played by members of the government (with the exception of the economy minister, the conservative Bruno Le Maire) and the character of Macron have turned the presidency into a one-man affair.\n\nMacron, the candidate “of the right and of the left,” is a right-wing president. “He has developed a system of government that is too vertical, he has not been able to create a true center party and he has not been able to reach consensus and state pacts,” criticizes Manuel Valls.\n\nThe prosperous and urban France brought Macron to the Elysee. Macron made the mistake of governing for that France alone, and not for the other one that is rural, poorly paid and depends on diesel and subsidies. He insisted on underestimating the revolt of the “yellow vests,” with whom his prime minister, the conservative Édouard Philippe, rejected any negotiation. The president put an end to the crisis by taking to the streets in person to hold large public debates that lasted entire days.\n\nMacron, along with his wife, Brigitte, inside Nanterre stadium, on the outskirts of Paris, on April 2. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nHe was unable to enjoy his success. The pandemic emerged and the liberal economic policy was transformed into a policy of massive subsidies. Now, inflation and war have accentuated the exceptionality. The mysterious phrase issued by Jacques Attali, his great mentor, will always float over the politics of Emmanuel Macron: “Macron embodies nothingness.”\n\nThe philosopher\n\nEmmanuel Macron relentlessly feeds his aura as a president-philosopher, as a romantic intellectual who cannot end the day without reading some of René Char’s poems or immersing himself in a metaphysical treatise. There is, however, a flaw in the character. Macron was twice rejected at the École Normale Supérieure (Normal Sup), the true Olympus of the humanities in France. He had to settle for studying philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, where admission is much easier. It is true that the double rejection occurred at a stormy time, when the young Emmanuel and Brigitte had just broken ties with their past and taken refuge in Paris.\n\n"Perhaps the legend of Macron as a great intellectual has been exaggerated, and perhaps he has done his best to exaggerate that legend," says one of France\'s most renowned philosophers, a man who participated in some of the Bercy dinners and prefers not to be cited. "I see him more as a great technocrat, banker and high official, with a sensitivity to culture and humanistic concerns, but with a relatively superficial philosophical knowledge."\n\nGaspard Gantzer insists that Macron sees himself as a writer. A writer without any written work, in any case. The current president often speaks of the influence exerted on him by Paul Ricoeur, the great figure of French phenomenology, a unanimously respected humanist and socialist philosopher. “It was Ricoeur who pushed me into politics,” he once said.\n\nMacron helped Ricoeur as an editorial assistant on his latest and best-known work, Memory, History, Forgetting. Basically, he looked for documentation and wrote up the bibliographic records. He took advantage of his relationship with Ricoeur to get on the editorial board of Esprit, the best-known French journal on philosophy, and publish a few articles with very little impact.\n\nThe current president graduated in philosophy (he is also a finance inspector) with a thesis on Machiavelli, whose work he has not stopped reading. The “Jupiterian” tone of his presidency, in the most majestic sense of the term, and his predilection for results, rather than for theories and principles, are possibly related to his Machiavellian studies.\n\n“They say that Macron exercises power as an enlightened despot, which has its logic, because enlightened despotism is the system that is usually associated with the prince-philosopher,” said Francis Wolff, a professor emeritus of philosophy at Normal Sup and a world authority on Aristotle, in statements to the authors of The traitor and the void.\n\nThere is almost unanimous agreement in his close circle about Macron’s talent when it comes to reciting poetry. He has memorized thousands of verses, his delivery is strong and he uses the resources of an actor. If necessary, he can also sit down at the piano: he studied it for 10 years. On the whole, he has a much higher cultural veneer than is usual among heads of state and government. And he loves for people to notice it.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/KRW02FqOeEcLxlEDFjjIV-lyGF8=/1200x0/filters:focal(584x435:594x445)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/A4TNZCX3AVHXZPJVY7QFQO6ZHQ.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:09'}

Le Pen\'s result this time around was the best ever for the far right.\n\nMacron acknowledged some of the challenges he now faces in his victory speech Sunday night in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\n“Our country is beset by doubts and divisions,” he said. “Today’s vote requires us to consider all the hardships of people’s lives and to respond effectively to them and to the anger expressed.”\n\nThe French president has a long to-do list, ranging from preparing for key parliamentary elections in June to implementing his long-delayed pension reform plans and dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron also has to contend with an energised far left, many of whom backed far-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round and voted for the incumbent in the final round only to stop a far-right victory.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. Mélenchon’s France is not reconcilable with Le Pen’s, he said.

As one campaign ended, another quickly began.\n\nThe 70-year-old is now seeking to line up an "intergroup" of left-wing allies in the National Assembly that would allow him to force a power-sharing “cohabitation” government with President Emmanuel Macron’s La Republic on the Move (LREM) party.\n\nWith nearly 22 percent of the first round vote, Mélenchon feels he’s in a strong position to build a so-called “New Popular Union” around himself and LFI.\n\nSo what alliances will the far-left kingmaker be able to forge with parties that declined to join forces with him in the presidential polls?\n\nConditions\n\nAs it courts potential allies, LFI – which is certain to build handsomely on its 17 National Assembly lawmakers – has laid out conditions for any future partnerships. Its main policies of lowering the retirement age to 60 years, raising the minimum wage, price freezes and the ushering in of a “Sixth Republic” are not negotiable.\n\nLFI also wants its own candidates to be allowed to run in the number of constituencies that is proportional to its vote share in the presidentials.

Despite the paltry 1.75 percent of the vote managed by presidential hopeful Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists still enjoy a well-established local power base, with 28 lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nA representative of the Communist Party (PCF) told BFMTV that the “disrespectful” number of constituencies offered to them meant the jury was still out on their involvement in a possible coalition.\n\n"There is still too much uncertainty to say whether the Communists will accept this agreement or slam the door," the PCF member said.\n\nElsewhere, LFI is also in talks with the New Anti-Capitalist Party, which has responded favourably and has been openly pushing LFI’s notion that the June polls represent a "third round” of the presidential contest.\n\nAll 577 deputy seats in the lower house will be up for grabs on 12 and 19 June, with LREM likely to meet stiff resistance.

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us.

The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

At the same time, most age groups were split more evenly between Macron and Le Pen; the only group that went all out for the incumbent president were the 18-to-24-year-olds. Yes, Generation Z, the post-millennials, saved Macron. And not so much because of their outpouring love for the president, but out of their fear of the alternative.\n\nThe French presidential election system was set up this way by President Charles de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic. The two-round system (no one gets 51% of the votes in the first round) often forces a second-round competition between a centrist and an extremist candidate, and the majority always prefers the centrist. Next, France will have a parliamentary election and the reelected Macron will campaign for the voters to give his party the majority so that his premiere would be from his own party and not, embarrassingly, from the opposition. He’ll get that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo, how come, on Monday morning, the euro fell 0.34% against the dollar, to $1.07725, close to its two-year low last week? Reuters suggested investors may be relieved to see that Le Pen is not in office, but this doesn’t mean they have high expectations of the winner. Still, the nationalist Le Pen promised to nationalize some key parts of France’s industry, cut taxes radically, and curtail France’s participation in the EU budget. The nightmare is over, investors, what’s holding y’all back?\n\nTurns out the future of the world’s economy is mired in anxiety: US stocks are not performing; futures are declining; China is being revisited by the pandemic it may have invented, so large chunks of its workforce are under lockdowns; supply chains are getting bogged down even worse than before; and Putin continues to try to salvage some measure of victory over Ukraine in time for May 9, the anniversary of the Red Army’s victory over the Nazis.\n\nThe dollar roared over in Israel, too, where it struck NIS 3.27 for the first time in who knows how long. It has probably more to do with the Fed raising interest rates recently than with French politics, but it couldn’t come at a better time, when Israel is struggling to retool its economy and restart its lavish exports again.\n\nMost French Jews heaved a sigh of relief over Macron’s win, especially Orthodox Jews – who would normally align with the right-wing candidate. The reason is that Le Pen, despite her cosmetic efforts, is more an old-fashion fascist than a modern-day extreme right-winger. As part of her fierce anti-immigration (some say xenophobic) policy, she promised to ban animal slaughter without stunning, insisting that stunning the animal is more humane. Of course, stunning renders the animal as “traif” for both Jews and Muslims, who threatened that they would leave France if they were deprived of their kosher and halal meat (If Le Pen Wins, She’ll Ban Kosher Shechita in France).\n\nAnd since France exports kosher meat, a ban on its production in France would have had a devastating impact on Jewish communities elsewhere, most notably in neighboring Switzerland.\n\nMany right-wing Israelis didn’t see a big distinction between Macron and Le Pen because both support the two-state solution and a Palestinian state. But if that’s your litmus test, then most Western and Third-World countries should be classified as anti-Israel. I thought Macron stood out as a friend a couple of weeks ago, when he clashed with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, calling him a “far-right antisemite.” So Emanuel can’t be all bad.\n\nHere’s what happened: Morawiecki compared the French president’s phone calls with Vladimir Putin to negotiating with Hitler. Now, you may support Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine or be against them, but they just don’t compare with what Hitler did to most of Europe and the rest of the planet. In response, Macron told Le Parisien that Morawiecki was trying to help Le Pen, and called him a “far-right antisemite who bans LGBT persons” in his country.\n\nA spokesman for Morawiecki said it was a lie and the Polish PM wasn’t an antisemite. But he kind of is. In 2018 he said Jews were involved in perpetrating the Holocaust (which would have been a brilliant solution to the supply chain problems). And Morawiecki is also behind the Polish law that punishes anyone who blames Poles for taking part in the Nazi Holocaust crimes.\n\nAnd, in June 2021, after Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called the new Polish law barring Jews from filing Holocaust restitution claims in Poland “immoral,” PM Morawiecki said, “I can only say that as long as I am the prime minister, Poland will not pay for German crimes: Neither zloty, nor euro, nor dollar.”\n\nSee? It always comes down to economics.

The centre has held. Yesterday (24 April), 2022 stopped being 2022 just long enough for Emmanuel Macron to see off Marine Le Pen and secure re-election as the president of France. The result came as a great relief to millions around the world.\n\n\n\nMany are tempted to try and read into the result some grander narrative in which Europe remains a sort of liberal Hyperborea, a paradise from which the British expelled themselves in 2016 (together with Americans in electing Donald Trump). On closer inspection, however, this conception doesn’t quite square with the bald reality: the Rassemblement National (RN), a party explicitly rooted in the post-fascist far right, has just taken 41 per cent of the second-round vote in one of the European Union’s most important member states.\n\nAdmirers in Britain have long been prepared to overlook the unfortunate truth that France is home to one of the world’s largest white far-right parties. While Macron might have won yesterday’s election, the trend of the far right is only upward in France. Back in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, first broke through to contest the second round of the presidential election, French voters united around Jacques Chirac and rejected the Front National (as the RN was known at the time) by more than four to one. The elder Le Pen took less than 18 per cent of the second-round vote. Yet in 2017, his daughter Marine won more than 33 per cent – and yesterday, she won 41 per cent. Furthermore, while in Britain even the respectable right has serious trouble wooing younger voters, polling by YouGov has suggested that in France the RN is ahead with voters aged 18-24, as well as winning voters directly from the far left.\n\nFrance is not the only EU country to display this trend, however: there are plenty of other correctives for anyone who, despairing of the UK’s current government, might pine for a lost Eden across the English Channel. Across southern Europe the long political legacy of the EU’s tough response to the financial crisis plays out in the rise of right-wing parties that, like the RN, harbour more or less explicit links to historical anti-democratic movements. Italy not only contains the populist party Lega Nord but its smaller ally Fratelli d’Italia, whose logo features the familiar tricoloured flame of the postwar far right.\n\nRelated\n\nIn Spain meanwhile, Vox, a party with Francoist undertones, has outflanked Madrid’s traditional parties of the right on the question of Spanish unity, and secured its first beachhead in government. In eastern Europe, there is the organised, multinational challenge of the Visegrád Group; while in wealthy northern Europe, the social democratic Danish government recently adopted what Foreign Policy called “one of the harshest refugee policies in the world”.\n\nIn contrast, despite the performative toughness of the Rwanda proposals, the United Kingdom operates what the statistics show to be a pretty liberal immigration regime. Whatever its flaws, no sober observer can conflate the Conservative Party with the far-right movements gaining ground on the continent.\n\nNone of this is proof that Brexit was a good idea, of course, nor that France and Europe are not home to real liberal achievements. But we should accept that a country in which Le Pen takes 40 per cent of the vote is no nirvana.', 'image': 'https://www.newstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1236459286-1038x778.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:50'}

Faced with the prospect of a far-right takeover of the Élysée, a sufficient number of voters put aside their reservations regarding Emmanuel Macron and made him the first president to win a second term in office for 20 years. In the end, Mr Macron’s 58%-42% victory over Marine Le Pen was much more comfortable than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when some polls predicted a knife-edge contest.\n\nFor France – and the rest of Europe – the alternative outcome would have been disastrous and destabilising. Ms Le Pen’s authoritarian, nationalist and xenophobic vision would have led to civil strife domestically and undermined solidarity between western democracies at a vital time. That Mr Macron successfully averted this worst-case scenario is a cause for celebration. But as his victory speech on Sunday night tacitly acknowledged, an election won with the help of the fear factor has delivered an exceptionally fragile mandate. Describing France as riven by doubt and division, Mr Macron pledged to be “not the candidate of one camp, but the president of all of us”. Such assurances are commonplace from victorious political leaders, but it is vital that Mr Macron makes good on them during a second term, which looks challenging to say the least.\n\nAs the election laid bare, France is dangerously divided along economic and generational fault lines. A majority of blue-collar workers – and more than four in 10 voters overall – opted for Ms Le Pen. This, the best score in the history of the French far right, allowed Ms Le Pen to declare her share of the vote a “victory in itself”. Disturbingly, it indicates that the normalisation of her movement is all but complete. Mr Macron’s core vote, by contrast, came from wealthy business people, middle-class professionals and retired people. Younger, well educated but economically precarious voters who supported the radical left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round were left without a dog in the fight.\n\nReflecting widespread disillusionment with the choice on offer, particularly among the young, the rate of abstention was the highest for a presidential runoff since 1969. Among potential voters under the age of 25, more than 40% failed to cast a ballot. Enough voters on the left lent their support to Mr Macron to keep the far right out of power, but in fewer numbers than in 2017. Hostilities on the right and the left will now be resumed ahead of parliamentary elections in June.\n\nIf he is to successfully navigate this volatile political landscape, Mr Macron will need to adopt a radically different playbook from the one that characterised his first five years in the Élysée. During that time, he acquired a reputation as the “president of the rich” after watering down a wealth tax, pursuing unpopular pension reforms and imposing a fuel tax that sparked the gilets jaunes movement. An autocratic style contributed to the widespread impression that Mr Macron’s declared intention to transform and liberalise the French economy would be accomplished at the expense of the less well-off.\n\nTo make good on his aspirations to reach out across the divides, Mr Macron will need to do far more to address such concerns and insecurities. During a campaign that became unexpectedly close, there were signs that this was being recognised. In an encouraging early statement of intent, it has already been signalled that there will be full consultation with unions and other bodies over proposals to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, in a still fragile post-Covid economy, Mr Macron should also recognise that more needs to be done to protect and improve the living standards of blue-collar workers and the youthful precariat, which voted en masse for Mr Mélenchon. As he contemplates five more years in office, Mr Macron must realise that he has been given not so much a mandate as another chance.', 'image': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f9dc305d6b01ad6e862da6d17afc1f0e1d372f/0_0_4625_2774/master/4625.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4f9959a701f15dfce678c4ac1137a3cd', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:42'}

But this flattering score falls to 38.52% of the electorate, i.e. the registered voters. In other words, nearly two thirds of the French did not vote Macron.

Here is France cut into small pieces, like a puzzle. If it is true that the first round revealed the tri-polarization of French political life, the second round shows us a France of the elites against a France of the people, a France of the big cities against a France of the rural areas, a France of the “bobos”, happy and rich, and a France of the eternally forgotten, of the poor (there are 10 million of them) who can neither find decent housing, nor heat, nor food, nor entertainment.\n\nIn these conditions, how can one be the president “of all the French”?

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

Several courts in France have since convicted the French government for failing to adequately address climate change and not reaching its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe republican front has started to crumble\n\nBut Macron did pay a price for all these policies.\n\nFrance\'s so-called republican front — democratic parties and voters standing together to block the far-right from rising to power — has started to crumble.\n\nAt an anti-racism demonstration between the two rounds of voting, protesters were up in arms about yet again seeing Le Pen reach the run-off.\n\nThey were also aghast that they would once again have to vote for a candidate who doesn\'t appeal to them.\n\n"Marine Le Pen is threatening our rule of law, but that doesn\'t mean I will give my vote to Macron — he only implements right-wing policies," one protester in his twenties said, explaining that the French had already held their noses and voted for Macron in 2017.\n\nHe added that the current president hadn\'t done anything for young people — Macron reduced, for example, housing subsidies.\n\nMany of the protesters were supporters of Jean-Luc Melenchon, the left candidate who picked up 22% of the vote in round one. These were ballots that Macron desperately needed to win the run-off vote.\n\nWatch video 05:02 Macron will have to overcome dislike even among those who voted for him: DW\'s Lisa Louis\n\nMacron needs to change if he wants to stop the far-right from rising\n\nMacron did manage to convince enough of Mélenchon\'s voters to keep him in power — or rather Le Pen out of power. But many begrudged having to support Macron.\n\nThey see him as a lofty, arrogant manager, who\'s disconnected from their day-to-day worries.\n\nSome therefore even opted to abstain or vote for Le Pen, their priority instead to block Macron from staying in power.\n\nIt\'s far from certain that, presented with the same scenario five years down the road, those Mélenchon supporters who did vote for Macron would do so again.\n\nThat\'s why the president reelect needs to urgently start implementing more left-wing and ecological measures. Macron needs to change his ways and show that he does understand the suffering of those who feel left behind, in order to give left-wing voters the feeling that he is an acceptable alternative.\n\nThe president indicated in his speech he\'d do all this. Now, he needs to follow through with it.\n\nIf he doesn\'t, that could lead to, or at least contribute to, a further stengthened far-right. What decides the next French presidential election might then be \'anyone unlike Macron,\' rather than \'anyone but Le Pen.\'\n\nEdited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru', 'image': 'https://static.dw.com/image/61577081_6.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:25'}

Far-right Marine Le Pen and veteran leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round of voting, both hope to mobilise voters to form a strong parliamentary opposition to the freshly re-elected president.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nWith a 17-point lead over his far-right rival, Macron secured a decisive victory against Le Pen in Sunday’s presidential run-off, dashing her hopes of an upset win as he did in 2017. But Le Pen made major gains, cutting Macron’s margin nearly in half compared to five years ago, when he defeated her 66 points to 34.\n\nLe Pen is keen to channel that momentum into the next round of voting: France’s legislative elections, on June 12 and 19. Speaking shortly after the results were announced Sunday, she urged her supporters to turn to the “great battle” ahead.\n\n“Tonight we launch the great battle of the legislative elections,” Le Pen said. “I will lead this battle alongside Jordan Bardella, with all those who had the courage to oppose Emmanuel Macron in the second round, with all those who have France at heart.”\n\nLe Pen, herself a member of France’s National Assembly since 2017, representing the northern Pas-de-Calais region, sought to present her party as the leading force of opposition to Macron.\n\n“The National Rally will seek to rally those who want to come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from, in order to field and support candidates everywhere,” she said.\n\nSpeaking on news channel TF1, the National Rally's acting president Bardella described the June elections as the “third round” of presidential voting.\n\n‘The third round begins tonight’\n\nLeftist Mélenchon, for his part, expressed his satisfaction with Le Pen’s defeat.\n\n“It’s very good news for the unity of our people,” Mélenchon said. But he had no kind words for the incumbent. The two finalists on Sunday had the support of “barely over a third of registered voters”, he said, before also turning to the legislative elections.\n\n“Don’t give up,” said Mélenchon, an opposition MP since 2017, representing parts of Marseille. “The third round begins tonight. On June 12 and 19, another world is still possible if you elect a majority of MPs from the new popular union, which must continue to grow.”\n\nAfter Le Pen edged him out in the first round, Mélenchon had called on voters to elect him prime minister in the legislative elections. His campaign director Manuel Bompard still believes he has a chance.\n\nMélenchon can still be prime minister, “not to be prime minister but to pass his platform, freeze prices, raise the minimum wage, and put in place a Sixth Republic”, Bompard said.\n\nÀ toutes et à tous, je dis : ne vous résignez pas.

France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nTalking to reporters on April 25, Johnson said it is “very important” to have a French president “who can be relied upon” on international issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s not right for friendly governments to comment on elections in neighbouring countries but what I can certainly say is that it is very, very important that Emmanuel and I have been able to work closely together on Ukraine over the last few weeks and months,” he said.\n\n“We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of NATO, has been absolutely vital for the stance we’ve taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I’m very, very reassured by that.”\n\nFrench President and La Republique en Marche party candidate for reelection Emmanuel Macron celebrates after his victory in France’s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

Ahead of Macron now lies the task of “rallying the French people, who voted strongly for right-wing and left-wing populists in this round of elections, probably out of disappointment, behind the political centre again,” Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesperson of the conservative CDU told EURACTIV.\n\nThe result is a “serious reminder” to the French president that “France now needs a social and ecological renewal” as France is facing “deep social divides,” a senior Social Democrat, MEP Udo Bullmann, told EURACTIV.\n\n“Emmanuel Macron’s election victory was more important for Europe than the German federal election. France has voted against right-wing populism and resentment and favoured President Macron’s Europe,” chancellor candidate for the CDU/CSU in 2021, Armin Laschet, told EURACTIV.\n\nAustrian and Dutch leaders also focused on the pro-EU signal of Macron’s victory.\n\nIn Rome, Madrid, Lisbon and Athens, leaders highlighted France’s commitment to the European project.\n\nIn Italy, Lega leader Matteo Salvini congratulated Le Pen, tweeting: “Congratulations, Marine! Alone against everyone, coherent and smiling, you have gathered the vote of 13 million French people, an unprecedented rate. Together for a Europe based on work, family, security, rights and freedom”.\n\nGreek MEP Stelios Kouloglou told EURACTIV that all polls show that disadvantaged French people support the far-right candidate as they feel marginalised by the political and social system. “Far-right demagogues are all over Europe are waiting if the problems of the vast majority are not solved.”\n\n“Five years is very little in history.

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

Police used tear gas to disperse gatherings in Paris and the western city of Rennes.\n\n- New era -\n\nIn a victory speech on the Champ de Mars in central Paris at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, Macron vowed to respond to the anger of voters who backed his far-right rival, saying his new term would not continue unchanged from the last five years.\n\n"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right," he told thousands of cheering supporters.\n\n"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me."\n\nHe also pledged a "renewed method" to govern France, adding that this "new era" would not be one of "continuity with the last term which is now ending".\n\nIn a combative speech to supporters in Paris in which she accepted the result but showed no sign of quitting politics, Le Pen, 53, said she would "never abandon" the French and was already preparing for the June legislative elections.\n\n"The result represents a brilliant victory," she said to cheers.\n\n"This evening, we launched the great battle for the legislative elections," Le Pen said, adding that she felt "hope" and calling on opponents of the president to join with her National Rally (RN) party.\n\n- \'Count on France\' -\n\nThe result is narrower than the second-round clash in 2017, when the same two candidates met in the run-off and Macron polled over 66 percent of the vote.\n\nFor Le Pen, her third defeat in presidential polls will be a bitter pill to swallow after she plowed years of effort into making herself electable and distancing her party from the legacy of its founder, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nCritics insisted her party never stopped being extreme-right and racist while Macron repeatedly pointed to her plan to ban the wearing of the Muslim headscarf in public if elected.\n\nThe projections caused immense relief in Europe after fears a Le Pen presidency would leave the continent rudderless following Brexit and the departure from politics of German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news for all of Europe" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nEU president Charles Michel said the bloc could now "count on France for five more years" while Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also congratulated him, saying she was "delighted to be able to continue our excellent cooperation".\n\nIn another election Sunday, Slovenia\'s three-time Prime Minister Janez Jansa, criticized by opponents as an authoritarian right-wing populist, was at risk of losing power to a party led by political newcomer Robert Golob.\n\n- \'Ocean of abstention\' -\n\nMacron will be hoping for a less complicated second term that will allow him to implement his vision of more pro-business reform and tighter EU integration, after a first term shadowed by protests, then the pandemic and finally Russia\'s military operation in Ukraine.\n\nBut he will have to win over those who backed his opponents and the millions of French who did not bother to vote.\n\nPolling organizations estimated turnout of just 72 percent, the lowest in any presidential election second-round run-off since 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, according to partial results, 6.45 percent of voters in the election voted for neither candidate in blank ballots while 2.35 percent spoilt their papers.\n\nThe hard-left third-placed candidate in the first round, Jean-Luc Melenchon, had refused to endorse Macron.\n\nHe has his eyes firmly set on the June elections.\n\nMelenchon welcomed Le Pen\'s defeat as "very good news for the unity of our people" but said Le Pen and Macron had barely managed to win a third of support from registered voters.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots", he said.', 'image': 'https://cdnimgen.royanews.tv/imageserv/Size728Q40/news/20220425/35368.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:44'}

And so do U.S. voters in general, not just Republicans. Nearly 60 percent of those who participated in a recent Gallup poll said there was too much immigration into the country. That makes anti-immigrant sentiment mainstream. Le Pen\'s platform also proposed that non-citizen immigrants arrested for any crime be sent back to their country of origin. This fringe position in France is the law of the land in America and has been for years.\n\n"They\'re bringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime. They\'re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," Donald Trump said on the day in 2015 that he announced he was running for president. During his tenure in office, Trump took many different steps to limit immigration, and not just the illegal sort. In fact, in 2020, he reduced the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. by 49 percent.\n\nWhat puts Le Pen and the National Rally Party in the far-right corner of politics, then? Like her near-fascist father before her, Le Pen isn\'t fond of immigrants, and I mean really not fond . She wants them to assimilate to French culture to the point where they would be indistinguishable from France\'s original immigrants (or rather, invaders), the Germanic Franks, who came for a visit to the Roman Empire in the 4th century and never went away. But even more than assimilating, Le Pen and her party would much rather immigrants just go back to where they came from.\n\nAnalysts all over the world woke up on Monday morning to mourn the fact that far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen wasn\'t beaten soundly enough, even though she lost by more than 16 points to a man few people in France apparently love , the incumbent Emmanuel Macron.\n\nNational Rally is also famously skeptical of international alliances, especially those with NATO and the European Union. France is one of the founding members of the EU, and along with Germany, forms its heart. For France to leave the Union would gut it, and possibly bring an end to the "European project" of peace and economic cooperation for the continent. But such actions don\'t send a shudder down the spine of Americans; Trump for his part killed a major trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, threatened to undo America\'s free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, pulled out of the Paris climate treaty, and came closer than we ever knew to essentially pulling the U.S. out of NATO — all to the applause of many Republicans.\n\nTrump was not standing out in the cold on the issue of NATO, either. Before the war in Ukraine, only 48 percent of Americans thought the organization was doing a good job, and a full 65 percent of Republicans thought it was doing a poor job. If France is the heart of the EU, the U.S. simply is NATO. The U.S. founded the alliance and provides a shield for the other members that fall under the American aegis. This may change, thanks Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s war in Ukraine, which has forced Europe to rethink its role in its own defense, but as of right now, U.S. leadership is clear and unquestioned.\n\nAnd speaking of the war in Ukraine and Russia in general, Le Pen and Trump share something else: A love for Putin. Over and over, Trump praised Putin for his intelligence, strength, and the high quality of his negotiating tactics. He even asked for Russia to help him get dirt on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, which is widely believed to have been tainted by Russian interference, both online and off. Le Pen is also deeply tied to Putin, speaking warmly of the autocrat while her National Rally happily took Russian money. She has praised Putin\'s nationalism and skepticism of globalization.\n\nLe Pen\'s economic policies are not a one-to-one correlation with those in the GOP — this is France after all, so some "socialism" on health care and other issues are required — but the fear of corporate globalism is exactly the same. Trump\'s "America First" economics fit very well with Le Pen\'s ideas.\n\nOn social issues, National Rally had to moderate several positions to become competitive in France. Gay marriage and abortion play their part in the political process over there, just as they do here, and Le Pen had to loosen up. The difference here is that America\'s far-right is succeeding in protecting the "traditional values" of the Dark Ages.\n\nSo could Le Pen be elected in America? No, she\'s a foreigner. But as far as her positions go, there\'s very little to bar a politician like her. We\'ve already voted for people on the local and national levels who make Le Pen practically look like a liberal. Even her position that Muslims should not be allowed to wear headscarves in public places, while extreme, falls in line with overall American feelings about Muslims.\n\nEven now, as President Biden is being praised elsewhere in the world for rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and reaffirming America\'s commitment to NATO, there are viable presidential candidates waiting in the wings to undo that work. And even if they don\'t win in 2024, chances are they\'ll be a lot closer to the White House than 16 points behind.', 'image': 'https://mediacloud.theweek.com/image/upload/s--X-WVjvBW--/f_auto,t_content-image-full-desktop@1/v1650910407/Trump le pen.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

These are set to alter further the balance of power between the Socialists and the Republicains who have already imploded and are struggling to survive.\n\nInstead, the main opponents of Macron’s liberal, centrist La République En Marche are Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s far-left La France Insoumise and Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement national.\n\nWhat are the possible scenarios?\n\nAn “unlikely” far-right or far-left majority\n\nAccording to Thanassis Diamantopoulos, professor of political science at the University of Athens and expert on the French regime, the hypothesis of a far-right or far-left majority in the National Assembly is “unlikely”, despite the historically high scores of Le Pen and Mélenchon’s parties.\n\nIn France, the two-round majoritarian single-member electoral system means that “even with a majority, the far right and far left cannot win parliamentary elections. […] They have no potential to form an alliance”, and it is easier for “the forces around the centre to form an alliance”, Diamantopoulos told EURACTIV France.\n\nBut in recent days, Mélenchon has unequivocally called on his supporters: “I ask you to elect me Prime minister”.\n\nBetween the fact that “there will be no defections” in favour of Mélenchon’s party and the “under-representation of the extremes”, the possibility that his appeal will become a reality in the ballot box remains dim.\n\nAnother element that works against the most radical parties is that “there are two ‘anti-system’ expressions, one on the far right and the other on the left”.\n\nFor these reasons, eight deputies were elected under the banner of the Rassemblement National in 2017, despite qualifying for the second round of the presidential election, and Mélenchon’s party had seventeen. These results are far below the overall results at the national level.\n\nThe (new) attempt to unite the left\n\nOn the left, the urgent need for unity is being felt both by executives and voters, in order to regain influence and hope to impose a social and ecological majority on Macron.\n\nContacted by EURACTIV France, Sylvie Guillaume, a Socialist MEP, said she hoped that “the legislative elections [will make it possible to] restore a better balance because the presidential election is not a blank check” for the newly re-elected president.\n\nThe same is true of the Insoumis — Mélenchon’s supporters — who want to believe in uniting the left.\n\nMEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV France that her movement “appeals to those who do not feel represented” and admits to being in discussion with the other left-wing forces, to agree on “a common base”.\n\nThe call of Mélenchon and his supporters seem to have been heard by the other left-wing movements. Europe Ecologie Les Verts MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV France that “the political forces of the left and the ecologists must organise themselves to weigh together if they do not want to condemn themselves to lose separately”.\n\nLéon Deffontaines, president of the young communists’ movement, told EURACTIV France he hoped to see “the ideas of equality, sharing and solidarity become the majority again”.\n\nCommunist candidate Fabien Roussel pleaded on Sunday evening for a “global agreement” of the left, demanding that “local anchors and different sensibilities on the left be taken into account” in order to avoid the distribution benefiting only La France Insoumise, which largely dominated the left in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nYet, according to Diamantopoulos, even if “some constituencies [the left] could get some MPs elected” the idea of “getting close to a parliamentary majority is a political fiction”.\n\nWhat majority for Macron?\n\nDespite the parliamentary challenges, Macron will not throw in the towel.\n\nJudging by the comments of Gabriel Attal, spokesman for the outgoing government, confidence in Macron’s camp remains high.\n\n“I am convinced that the French will give the president of the republic the means to act to protect them, with a majority [in the National Assembly],” Attal told BFMTV-RMC on Monday morning.\n\nHaving limited manoeuvring room due to a lack of partisan alliances beyond the existing majority, Macron’s camp will try to convince voters of other political inclinations or, at best, conclude circumstantial agreements in the territories where this is possible.\n\nDiamantopoulos believes Macron could build a “presidential majority that would start with the former Gaullists (centre-right Républicains) and reach the hinge of the left, including perhaps even a part of the Socialist Party and, of course, the ecologists”.\n\nMacron must therefore, according to Diamantopoulos, “wink at the ecologists” the day after the election. His promise to appoint a prime minister “in charge of ecological planning” would be a step in this direction.\n\nBut the question is: when will this appointment take place? Diamantopoulos warned that this plan could be changed, depending on the results of the legislative elections, which will tilt the future government more to the right or the left, and thus define Macron’s alliance choices.\n\nAs a reminder, in 2017 he chose Edouard Philippe from the centre-right as prime minister, even though he was not forced to do so, having acquired a solid majority in the Assembly, as well as several other ministers from the right.\n\nAt the same time, Macron will also have to devote some of his energy to the French EU presidency.\n\n“He needs to ensure the ongoing French EU presidency is a success. It ends on June 30 and there is an upcoming conference on the Western Balkans to be organised soon, which provides an opportunity to start rethinking the EU’s enlargement policy,” Tara Varma of the European Council on Foreign Relations told EURACTIV in emailed comments.\n\n“Macron will have to take the mantle of European diplomatic leadership again.

He should travel to Kyiv immediately with (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz to demonstrate Europe’s support for Ukraine,” she said.\n\nBig relief after Macron's re-election but 'third round' ahead French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to unite a deeply divided nation after winning re-election on Sunday (24 April) in a battle against rival Marine Le Pen that saw the far right come its closest yet to taking power.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]", 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57636418-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:02'}

FRANCE 24 takes a look at some of the main takeaways from France\'s presidential vote.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nA nation divided\n\nA post-election map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country while Le Pen won backing in the struggling northern industrial heartlands, the Mediterranean south and French overseas territories.\n\nBig city centres, the upper-middle classes and older voters backed Macron while lower-income groups voted overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\nBut according to Mathieu Gallard, research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, it would be a mistake to imagine a country divided between an urban pro-Macron camp and rural Le Pen supporters.\n\n"The biggest fractures are, above all, generational and social," said Gallard.\n\nRising abstention\n\nTurnout was at just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest of any second-round vote in France since 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who made the effort to turn up at voting stations on Sunday cast a protest vote to send the message that neither candidate was acceptable. Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nMacron loses the French territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost 3 million.\n\nLe Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nMacron could only claim victory in the Pacific islands such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris.

Le Pen, a French nationalist representing the National Rally Party, called Macron a “climate hypocrite.” He jabbed back, dubbing Le Pen a “climate skeptic.”\n\nFor the moment, Macron has won out. On Sunday, the sitting French president defeated Le Pen with 58.5 percent of the vote — provoking a sigh of relief from many environmental activists, despite their quarrels with Macron during his previous 5-year term.\n\nLe Pen’s energy plan had called for exiting the European Union’s electricity market, accelerating the development of nuclear power, and establishing a moratorium on wind and solar development. (Nuclear currently provides about 70 percent of the country’s electricity; wind and solar combined provide only about 10 percent.) “Wind turbines are ugly and they ruin our landscapes,” Le Pen said in the April 20 debate. The far-right candidate had also vowed to cut the value-added tax on gas, electricity, and oil from 20 percent to 5.5 percent — a move that would have cost the government up to 12 billion euros (nearly $12.9 billion) and boosted demand for fossil fuels.\n\nGrist relies on the support of generous readers like you to keep our climate news free.

Here's How\n\nThe president’s climate policies could also spill over into neighboring European countries. France is currently the leader of the European Union Council, which is tasked with implementing Europe’s “Green Deal” — a massive spending package designed to help the continent get off fossil fuels. And Macron has been one of the most outspoken critics of using Russian coal and oil in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, calling for an outright blockade on the import of those fuels into the E.U. “The results of elections in France always reverberate way beyond the country’s borders,” Lucie Mattera, head of European politics at the think tank E3G, told E&E News last week. “And 2022 is no exception.”\n\nBut critics have argued that the president struggled to implement his climate agenda during his first term. After promising to cut emissions in his first presidential election, in 2017, Macron instituted increases in France’s fuel tax, with the aim of reducing emissions from the transportation sector. The resulting price hike sparked the gilet jaunes, or “yellow vests” movement, with hundreds of thousands of French citizens protesting in the streets.\n\nChagrined, Macron repealed the tax increases and launched a program of public participation in government — including a Citizens’ Convention on Climate, a randomly selected group of 150 voters tasked with helping the country create new climate policy. The president promised to pass their proposals on to the legislature or to a referendum “without filter” — but there, too, he ran into conflict. After the convention released its 149 proposals, Macron preemptively vetoed three of them, including a tax on corporate profits to fund clean energy. Only a few dozen of the citizens’ suggestions ended up in France’s sweeping 2021 climate law, and those often in watered-down form.\n\nIn the short term, the reelected president has promised to create a new prime minister position focused on “ecological planning” and increase investments in renewable technologies. Part of that may be an act of political expediency: Macron was shifted left during the campaign by the popular primary run of the leftist candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who attracted many young voters with his calls for a 200 billion euro ($214 billion) investment in green infrastructure and a constitutional amendment to protect biodiversity. The support for Mélenchon, Macron said in a speech last week, had sent a “powerful message.”", 'image': 'https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron_election_presidential_climate.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France. In twenty years, the Le Pen vote has doubled from the 5.5 million votes collected by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2002.

He is the teenager who fell in love with a 39-year-old teacher and was loved back in return, the Rothschild banker, the man who betrayed former president François Hollande, the pianist, the technocrat, the lover of poetry and theater, and the seducer. This is the portrait of Emmanuel Macron, 44, in four acts:\n\nThe man\n\nEmmanuel Macron was born in Amiens on December 21, 1977, the son of Jean-Michel, a doctor and professor of neurology, and Françoise, a general practitioner. He was the oldest of three brothers.\n\nThe man and the character were born 15 years later, towards the end of 1992, when the schoolboy fell in love with Brigitte Auzière, born Brigitte Trogneux, his French and drama teacher. The love was reciprocated. The teacher was 39 years old, married to a well-known local banker, and one of her daughters was Emmanuel’s classmate.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the impact of such an unconventional (and currently criminal) relationship in a relatively small, provincial city like Amiens, with a population of around 130,000. Brigitte’s family owned the most famous bakery in town. Emmanuel’s parents were doctors. They all knew each other. The Macrons tried to end the matter by sending their son to Paris. It was useless: Brigitte separated and visited Emmanuel on weekends. For her, Emmanuel was “a Mozart,” a boy who dazzled her with his intelligence and maturity. For him, Brigitte meant and still means everything.\n\nStill a minor, Emmanuel Macron broke with his family and with his hometown. He and Brigitte took on the world. It remains an indestructible union. The current president of France does not have great friends or confidants: Brigitte is enough for him. Without Brigitte, Macron cannot be understood.\n\nSeveral people who know Macron (as far as it is possible to know someone who is essentially hermetic) agree that he is a man who lives out his life as a fictional character, in search of increasingly sensational challenges and adventures. That craving is likely related to the taboo that was broken in 1992.\n\n“I think he would have liked to be a writer or an actor, and he applies his dramatic talent to politics as well as to his own life,” says Gaspard Gantzer, who was his classmate at the National School of Administration and then at the Elysée Palace: Macron was an adviser to president François Hollande, Gantzer was the press officer.\n\nMacron is a seducer capable of charming almost anyone. He sleeps very little, his memory is extraordinary and his capacity for work almost unlimited. “We are talking about a very, very brilliant man,” says Manuel Valls, France’s prime minister when Macron was economy minister.\n\n“He knows how to be cold when it suits him and he maintains his cool at all times, but he tends to take a positive approach to things and is capable of being very thoughtful and caring,” says Gantzer. All the people consulted agree in underlining two virtues of Macron: physical courage, which has more than once made him face hostile crowds (and get out of it thanks to his charm), and audacity. He was a good corporate banker at Rothschild. In that job, he learned to take risks and jump at any opportunity.\n\n"Where others see charm and friendliness, I have failed to see anything other than superficiality and narcissism," says a conservative politician who prefers not to be quoted.\n\nThe traitor\n\nEmmanuel Macron is haunted by the shadow of Eugène de Rastignac, the most famous social climber in French literature. Rastignac appears in several novels by Honoré de Balzac: he is a hustler who prospers in finances thanks to his lover’s husband; he marries his lover’s daughter and achieves a good position in Parisian society. “All politicians have something of Rastignac,” concedes Manuel Valls. “And the French system favors personality-driven ventures.”\n\nMacron, during his campaign trip to Marseille, on April 16. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nValls, who after serving as French prime minister later became a city councilor in Barcelona (he is a dual Spanish-French citizen), was one of the victims of the great conspiracy developed by Macron from inside the Élysée. He had fierce clashes with his economy minister and went to great lengths to convince then-president François Hollande to remove Macron from the palace. It was useless: Hollande fell under Macron’s spell until “the methodical betrayal” of his protégé, in Hollande’s own words, became evident. It was already too late.\n\nLe traître et le néant (or The traitor and the void), the book on Emmanuel Macron written by journalists Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme, confirms over and over again that Emmanuel Macron’s ability to fascinate is multiplied with older men and greater power. As soon as he left the National School of Administration, Macron successfully sought the protection of the most powerful men of the Republic: Jacques Attali and Alain Minc, two president-makers. It was Minc who procured him a job at the Rothschild Bank, so that he could amass wealth before devoting himself to politics. And it was Attali who brought him close to the Socialist Party and François Hollande.\n\nDuring Hollande’s presidency, first as an adviser and then as a minister, Emmanuel Macron played his own game. Luck helped him, as always: the strokes of fortune of the current president of France are legendary. When he was about to leave the Élysée for a well-paid teaching position, for example, a stroke of luck led him to the Ministry of Economy. In addition to luck, boldness and an amazing ability to deceive also played a role.\n\nMacron used all the resources of the ministry to weave a dense network of contacts. During his last eight months in office, Macron spent €120,000 on dinners held at the ministerial residence, an imposing glass-enclosed apartment facing the Seine. Some nights there were two dinner shifts with different diners. And a third shift was added at La Rotonde, the Macrons’ favorite brasserie.\n\nMacron was creating En Marche! (the name was chosen by Brigitte because she liked it and the initials coincided with those of her husband) and he repeatedly assured Hollande that it was a political club intended to support his re-election. Instead, together with a group of moderate socialists who felt orphaned by the fall of long-time party heavyweight Dominique Strauss-Kahn (the fall from grace of DSK after being accused of rape was one of Macron’s lucky breaks), Macron was in fact boycotting Hollande and actually preparing his own race for the presidency. The documents were burned in a stove. There was absolute secrecy.\n\nMacron destroyed the options of Hollande and Valls from within. Finally, he announced that he was not a socialist, forced his own dismissal and embarked on the campaign to become president of France.\n\nThe politician\n\nLike a corporate banker, Emmanuel Macron launched a takeover bid (after long secret preparations) for the Socialist Party. The initial core of En Marche! was made up of socialists disappointed by François Hollande, the president who wanted to be “normal” and ended up being irrelevant. Once the main party on the left had been dismantled, he captured very prominent figures from The Republicans, the great Gaullist party on the right. “He was the first to guess that the classic parties had collapsed, that the system was in a state of crisis,” says Manuel Valls.\n\nPerhaps Macron’s first presidential adventure would have failed if Alain Juppé had won the primaries of The Republicans. But François Fillon prevailed, a candidate whose campaign frayed when it was discovered that his wife received a salary without working and that he was irregularly financing his high lifestyle. Another stroke of luck: big banking and big industry abandoned Fillon and turned to Macron.\n\n“There is something Napoleonic in Macron’s brilliant career, he knew how to take risks at the right time and people followed him,” summarizes Valls, who in recent times has gotten closer to his old enemy. As soon as he found out that his rival in the second round would be far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, Macron already felt like a president. And he held a big party at La Rotonde, which was premature according to some and inappropriate according to others, because back then it was considered a disgrace for the far right to even reach the second round of voting.\n\nNobody considers that Macron’s five-year term has been a success. Macron has shown that he knows a lot about France, but very little about the French. La République en Marche, the presidential version of En Marche!, is not a party, but rather a group of clappers dazzled by their leader. The absence of internal criticism, the small role played by members of the government (with the exception of the economy minister, the conservative Bruno Le Maire) and the character of Macron have turned the presidency into a one-man affair.\n\nMacron, the candidate “of the right and of the left,” is a right-wing president. “He has developed a system of government that is too vertical, he has not been able to create a true center party and he has not been able to reach consensus and state pacts,” criticizes Manuel Valls.\n\nThe prosperous and urban France brought Macron to the Elysee. Macron made the mistake of governing for that France alone, and not for the other one that is rural, poorly paid and depends on diesel and subsidies. He insisted on underestimating the revolt of the “yellow vests,” with whom his prime minister, the conservative Édouard Philippe, rejected any negotiation. The president put an end to the crisis by taking to the streets in person to hold large public debates that lasted entire days.\n\nMacron, along with his wife, Brigitte, inside Nanterre stadium, on the outskirts of Paris, on April 2. Soazig de la Moissonniere\n\nHe was unable to enjoy his success. The pandemic emerged and the liberal economic policy was transformed into a policy of massive subsidies. Now, inflation and war have accentuated the exceptionality. The mysterious phrase issued by Jacques Attali, his great mentor, will always float over the politics of Emmanuel Macron: “Macron embodies nothingness.”\n\nThe philosopher\n\nEmmanuel Macron relentlessly feeds his aura as a president-philosopher, as a romantic intellectual who cannot end the day without reading some of René Char’s poems or immersing himself in a metaphysical treatise. There is, however, a flaw in the character. Macron was twice rejected at the École Normale Supérieure (Normal Sup), the true Olympus of the humanities in France. He had to settle for studying philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, where admission is much easier. It is true that the double rejection occurred at a stormy time, when the young Emmanuel and Brigitte had just broken ties with their past and taken refuge in Paris.\n\n"Perhaps the legend of Macron as a great intellectual has been exaggerated, and perhaps he has done his best to exaggerate that legend," says one of France\'s most renowned philosophers, a man who participated in some of the Bercy dinners and prefers not to be cited. "I see him more as a great technocrat, banker and high official, with a sensitivity to culture and humanistic concerns, but with a relatively superficial philosophical knowledge."\n\nGaspard Gantzer insists that Macron sees himself as a writer. A writer without any written work, in any case. The current president often speaks of the influence exerted on him by Paul Ricoeur, the great figure of French phenomenology, a unanimously respected humanist and socialist philosopher. “It was Ricoeur who pushed me into politics,” he once said.\n\nMacron helped Ricoeur as an editorial assistant on his latest and best-known work, Memory, History, Forgetting. Basically, he looked for documentation and wrote up the bibliographic records. He took advantage of his relationship with Ricoeur to get on the editorial board of Esprit, the best-known French journal on philosophy, and publish a few articles with very little impact.\n\nThe current president graduated in philosophy (he is also a finance inspector) with a thesis on Machiavelli, whose work he has not stopped reading. The “Jupiterian” tone of his presidency, in the most majestic sense of the term, and his predilection for results, rather than for theories and principles, are possibly related to his Machiavellian studies.\n\n“They say that Macron exercises power as an enlightened despot, which has its logic, because enlightened despotism is the system that is usually associated with the prince-philosopher,” said Francis Wolff, a professor emeritus of philosophy at Normal Sup and a world authority on Aristotle, in statements to the authors of The traitor and the void.\n\nThere is almost unanimous agreement in his close circle about Macron’s talent when it comes to reciting poetry. He has memorized thousands of verses, his delivery is strong and he uses the resources of an actor. If necessary, he can also sit down at the piano: he studied it for 10 years. On the whole, he has a much higher cultural veneer than is usual among heads of state and government. And he loves for people to notice it.\n\n\n\n', 'image': 'https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/KRW02FqOeEcLxlEDFjjIV-lyGF8=/1200x0/filters:focal(584x435:594x445)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/A4TNZCX3AVHXZPJVY7QFQO6ZHQ.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:09'}

"Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\n"The difficulties are going to start real soon," Teinturier told AFP.\n\nOverseas territories reject Macron: Voters choose Le Pen after voting Mélenchon in 1st round 01:53\n\nDisenchantment\n\nAddressing supporters late on Sunday, Macron vowed to heal rifts in a deeply divided country, promising a response to the "anger" that prompted many French to vote for the far right.\n\nTurnout was the lowest in any presidential election second-round run-off since 1969 and, in another striking sign of disenchantment with politics, 8.6 percent of people who showed up to vote either submitted a blank or nullified ballot in protest.\n\n"We need to respond to the angry and worried messages from millions of French people who say, \'I can\'t make ends meet\'," Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Monday.\n\nThe 44-year-old president now faces parliamentary elections in June, where keeping a majority will be critical for his ambitions.\n\n"Macron\'s biggest challenge will be to create a sense of cohesion in an extremely fragmented country," said Tara Varma, senior policy fellow and head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\'Victory without triumph\'\n\nFrench daily Le Monde called Macron\'s win "an evening of victory without a triumph".\n\nConservative daily Le Figaro said Macron\'s win was "no mean feat" but also asked: "Who can possibly believe that it is rooted in popular support?"\n\nWithin the next two weeks Macron is expected to reshuffle his government, with the departure of Prime Minister Jean Castex a near certainty, and several other ministers also likely to be replaced.\n\n"Many in government are exhausted and he needs new blood," said one Élysée official who asked not to be named.\n\nMacron will aim for gender parity in his next cabinet and has said he would like to see a woman become his next prime minister.\n\nFor Le Pen, 53, her third defeat in a presidential poll was a bitter pill after years of trying to soften her far-right image to make herself more electable. But she made clear she still had political ambitions.\n\nLe Pen said on Sunday she would "never abandon" the French and declared that she had scored a "brilliant victory" in her defeat.\n\nFor the upcoming parliamentary elections, her party has not formed an alliance with that of far-right rival Éric Zemmour, who scored 7 percent in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nSenior Le Pen aide Jean-Philippe Tanguy said Monday that Zemmour would have to acknowledge that she was the leader of the opposition.\n\nFrench parties look to win seats in June parliamentary election 01:40\n\nRelief among allies\n\nMacron will now try to implement his vision of more pro-business reforms and tighter EU integration after a first term overshadowed by protests, then the coronavirus pandemic and finally Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron\'s re-election sparked relief across Europe, where he has been seen as a guarantor of continuity.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news", European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said she was "delighted" and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters had "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nUS President Joe Biden, Canada\'s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Australian premier Scott Morrison also welcomed his win.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin – whom Macron had unsuccessfully sought to persuade to end the invasion of Ukraine – said Monday he wished the French president "success in your state activities, as well as good health and well-being".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Macron "a true friend of Ukraine".\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/07fd6986-c525-11ec-9a8a-005056bf8594/w:1280/p:16x9/macron-emotion.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:52:55'}

As one campaign ended, another quickly began.\n\nThe 70-year-old is now seeking to line up an "intergroup" of left-wing allies in the National Assembly that would allow him to force a power-sharing “cohabitation” government with President Emmanuel Macron’s La Republic on the Move (LREM) party.\n\nWith nearly 22 percent of the first round vote, Mélenchon feels he’s in a strong position to build a so-called “New Popular Union” around himself and LFI.\n\nSo what alliances will the far-left kingmaker be able to forge with parties that declined to join forces with him in the presidential polls?\n\nConditions\n\nAs it courts potential allies, LFI – which is certain to build handsomely on its 17 National Assembly lawmakers – has laid out conditions for any future partnerships. Its main policies of lowering the retirement age to 60 years, raising the minimum wage, price freezes and the ushering in of a “Sixth Republic” are not negotiable.\n\nLFI also wants its own candidates to be allowed to run in the number of constituencies that is proportional to its vote share in the presidentials.

Despite the paltry 1.75 percent of the vote managed by presidential hopeful Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists still enjoy a well-established local power base, with 28 lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nA representative of the Communist Party (PCF) told BFMTV that the “disrespectful” number of constituencies offered to them meant the jury was still out on their involvement in a possible coalition.\n\n"There is still too much uncertainty to say whether the Communists will accept this agreement or slam the door," the PCF member said.\n\nElsewhere, LFI is also in talks with the New Anti-Capitalist Party, which has responded favourably and has been openly pushing LFI’s notion that the June polls represent a "third round” of the presidential contest.\n\nAll 577 deputy seats in the lower house will be up for grabs on 12 and 19 June, with LREM likely to meet stiff resistance.

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us. Tonight we tell them that we will continue to transform Europe by their side”, she added.\n\nWhile Macron received many congratulations from his European counterparts, he acknowledged his victory was not as self-evident as last time.\n\n“Many of our compatriots voted for me, not to support the ideas I put forward, but to block the extreme right”, he told the crowd, thanking them and committing to address these divisions.\n\n“Our challenge is to restore French unity. The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:03'}

At the same time, most age groups were split more evenly between Macron and Le Pen; the only group that went all out for the incumbent president were the 18-to-24-year-olds. Yes, Generation Z, the post-millennials, saved Macron. And not so much because of their outpouring love for the president, but out of their fear of the alternative.\n\nThe French presidential election system was set up this way by President Charles de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic. The two-round system (no one gets 51% of the votes in the first round) often forces a second-round competition between a centrist and an extremist candidate, and the majority always prefers the centrist. Next, France will have a parliamentary election and the reelected Macron will campaign for the voters to give his party the majority so that his premiere would be from his own party and not, embarrassingly, from the opposition. He’ll get that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo, how come, on Monday morning, the euro fell 0.34% against the dollar, to $1.07725, close to its two-year low last week? Reuters suggested investors may be relieved to see that Le Pen is not in office, but this doesn’t mean they have high expectations of the winner. Still, the nationalist Le Pen promised to nationalize some key parts of France’s industry, cut taxes radically, and curtail France’s participation in the EU budget. The nightmare is over, investors, what’s holding y’all back?\n\nTurns out the future of the world’s economy is mired in anxiety: US stocks are not performing; futures are declining; China is being revisited by the pandemic it may have invented, so large chunks of its workforce are under lockdowns; supply chains are getting bogged down even worse than before; and Putin continues to try to salvage some measure of victory over Ukraine in time for May 9, the anniversary of the Red Army’s victory over the Nazis.\n\nThe dollar roared over in Israel, too, where it struck NIS 3.27 for the first time in who knows how long. It has probably more to do with the Fed raising interest rates recently than with French politics, but it couldn’t come at a better time, when Israel is struggling to retool its economy and restart its lavish exports again.\n\nMost French Jews heaved a sigh of relief over Macron’s win, especially Orthodox Jews – who would normally align with the right-wing candidate. The reason is that Le Pen, despite her cosmetic efforts, is more an old-fashion fascist than a modern-day extreme right-winger. As part of her fierce anti-immigration (some say xenophobic) policy, she promised to ban animal slaughter without stunning, insisting that stunning the animal is more humane. Of course, stunning renders the animal as “traif” for both Jews and Muslims, who threatened that they would leave France if they were deprived of their kosher and halal meat (If Le Pen Wins, She’ll Ban Kosher Shechita in France).\n\nAnd since France exports kosher meat, a ban on its production in France would have had a devastating impact on Jewish communities elsewhere, most notably in neighboring Switzerland.\n\nMany right-wing Israelis didn’t see a big distinction between Macron and Le Pen because both support the two-state solution and a Palestinian state. But if that’s your litmus test, then most Western and Third-World countries should be classified as anti-Israel. I thought Macron stood out as a friend a couple of weeks ago, when he clashed with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, calling him a “far-right antisemite.” So Emanuel can’t be all bad.\n\nHere’s what happened: Morawiecki compared the French president’s phone calls with Vladimir Putin to negotiating with Hitler. Now, you may support Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine or be against them, but they just don’t compare with what Hitler did to most of Europe and the rest of the planet. In response, Macron told Le Parisien that Morawiecki was trying to help Le Pen, and called him a “far-right antisemite who bans LGBT persons” in his country.\n\nA spokesman for Morawiecki said it was a lie and the Polish PM wasn’t an antisemite. But he kind of is. In 2018 he said Jews were involved in perpetrating the Holocaust (which would have been a brilliant solution to the supply chain problems). And Morawiecki is also behind the Polish law that punishes anyone who blames Poles for taking part in the Nazi Holocaust crimes.\n\nAnd, in June 2021, after Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called the new Polish law barring Jews from filing Holocaust restitution claims in Poland “immoral,” PM Morawiecki said, “I can only say that as long as I am the prime minister, Poland will not pay for German crimes: Neither zloty, nor euro, nor dollar.”\n\nSee? It always comes down to economics.

The centre has held. Yesterday (24 April), 2022 stopped being 2022 just long enough for Emmanuel Macron to see off Marine Le Pen and secure re-election as the president of France. The result came as a great relief to millions around the world.\n\n\n\nMany are tempted to try and read into the result some grander narrative in which Europe remains a sort of liberal Hyperborea, a paradise from which the British expelled themselves in 2016 (together with Americans in electing Donald Trump). On closer inspection, however, this conception doesn’t quite square with the bald reality: the Rassemblement National (RN), a party explicitly rooted in the post-fascist far right, has just taken 41 per cent of the second-round vote in one of the European Union’s most important member states.\n\nAdmirers in Britain have long been prepared to overlook the unfortunate truth that France is home to one of the world’s largest white far-right parties. While Macron might have won yesterday’s election, the trend of the far right is only upward in France. Back in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, first broke through to contest the second round of the presidential election, French voters united around Jacques Chirac and rejected the Front National (as the RN was known at the time) by more than four to one. The elder Le Pen took less than 18 per cent of the second-round vote. Yet in 2017, his daughter Marine won more than 33 per cent – and yesterday, she won 41 per cent. Furthermore, while in Britain even the respectable right has serious trouble wooing younger voters, polling by YouGov has suggested that in France the RN is ahead with voters aged 18-24, as well as winning voters directly from the far left.\n\nFrance is not the only EU country to display this trend, however: there are plenty of other correctives for anyone who, despairing of the UK’s current government, might pine for a lost Eden across the English Channel. Across southern Europe the long political legacy of the EU’s tough response to the financial crisis plays out in the rise of right-wing parties that, like the RN, harbour more or less explicit links to historical anti-democratic movements. Italy not only contains the populist party Lega Nord but its smaller ally Fratelli d’Italia, whose logo features the familiar tricoloured flame of the postwar far right.\n\nRelated\n\nIn Spain meanwhile, Vox, a party with Francoist undertones, has outflanked Madrid’s traditional parties of the right on the question of Spanish unity, and secured its first beachhead in government. In eastern Europe, there is the organised, multinational challenge of the Visegrád Group; while in wealthy northern Europe, the social democratic Danish government recently adopted what Foreign Policy called “one of the harshest refugee policies in the world”.\n\nIn contrast, despite the performative toughness of the Rwanda proposals, the United Kingdom operates what the statistics show to be a pretty liberal immigration regime. Whatever its flaws, no sober observer can conflate the Conservative Party with the far-right movements gaining ground on the continent.\n\nNone of this is proof that Brexit was a good idea, of course, nor that France and Europe are not home to real liberal achievements. But we should accept that a country in which Le Pen takes 40 per cent of the vote is no nirvana.', 'image': 'https://www.newstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1236459286-1038x778.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:33'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:50'}

Faced with the prospect of a far-right takeover of the Élysée, a sufficient number of voters put aside their reservations regarding Emmanuel Macron and made him the first president to win a second term in office for 20 years. In the end, Mr Macron’s 58%-42% victory over Marine Le Pen was much more comfortable than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when some polls predicted a knife-edge contest.\n\nFor France – and the rest of Europe – the alternative outcome would have been disastrous and destabilising. Ms Le Pen’s authoritarian, nationalist and xenophobic vision would have led to civil strife domestically and undermined solidarity between western democracies at a vital time. That Mr Macron successfully averted this worst-case scenario is a cause for celebration. But as his victory speech on Sunday night tacitly acknowledged, an election won with the help of the fear factor has delivered an exceptionally fragile mandate. Describing France as riven by doubt and division, Mr Macron pledged to be “not the candidate of one camp, but the president of all of us”. Such assurances are commonplace from victorious political leaders, but it is vital that Mr Macron makes good on them during a second term, which looks challenging to say the least.\n\nAs the election laid bare, France is dangerously divided along economic and generational fault lines. A majority of blue-collar workers – and more than four in 10 voters overall – opted for Ms Le Pen. This, the best score in the history of the French far right, allowed Ms Le Pen to declare her share of the vote a “victory in itself”. Disturbingly, it indicates that the normalisation of her movement is all but complete. Mr Macron’s core vote, by contrast, came from wealthy business people, middle-class professionals and retired people. Younger, well educated but economically precarious voters who supported the radical left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round were left without a dog in the fight.\n\nReflecting widespread disillusionment with the choice on offer, particularly among the young, the rate of abstention was the highest for a presidential runoff since 1969. Among potential voters under the age of 25, more than 40% failed to cast a ballot. Enough voters on the left lent their support to Mr Macron to keep the far right out of power, but in fewer numbers than in 2017. Hostilities on the right and the left will now be resumed ahead of parliamentary elections in June.\n\nIf he is to successfully navigate this volatile political landscape, Mr Macron will need to adopt a radically different playbook from the one that characterised his first five years in the Élysée. During that time, he acquired a reputation as the “president of the rich” after watering down a wealth tax, pursuing unpopular pension reforms and imposing a fuel tax that sparked the gilets jaunes movement. An autocratic style contributed to the widespread impression that Mr Macron’s declared intention to transform and liberalise the French economy would be accomplished at the expense of the less well-off.\n\nTo make good on his aspirations to reach out across the divides, Mr Macron will need to do far more to address such concerns and insecurities. During a campaign that became unexpectedly close, there were signs that this was being recognised. In an encouraging early statement of intent, it has already been signalled that there will be full consultation with unions and other bodies over proposals to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, in a still fragile post-Covid economy, Mr Macron should also recognise that more needs to be done to protect and improve the living standards of blue-collar workers and the youthful precariat, which voted en masse for Mr Mélenchon.

Turkey views "in principle positively" the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine after the end of the war with Russia.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'...

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:39'}

The war, which entered its third month, killed thousands and killed 5,500 refugees. Kyiv is also seeking help for Ukrainians stranded in the ruined city of Mariupol. According to the mayor, more than 100,000 people are still there and cannot be evacuated. Ukraine\'s defense in Mariupol is on the verge of collapse, admitted Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to President Zelensky. He also said that high-ranking US officials would not have come to Kyiv if "they were not ready to give up weapons".\n\nEarlier, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said that Russian troops not only did not respond to calls for a ceasefire but also prevented the population from leaving Mariupol and seeking refuge in the interior of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the ceasefire, Kyiv insists on safe and several-day humanitarian corridors for civilians who want to leave Mariupol and go to Kyiv-controlled territories. Authorities in Kyiv will also demand the release or exchange of their fighters, who are still trapped at the Azovstal plant.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Zelensky spoke with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to mediate a truce in Mariupol. Turkey views "in principle positively" the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine after the end of the war with Russia. This was stated in a statement issued by the presidential institution in Ankara after Erdogan\'s telephone conversation with Zelensky. Ukraine is pushing for collective security guarantees in exchange for its refusal to join NATO, pushed by Russian demands.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his re-election and said the French president was a "true friend of Ukraine".\n\n"Congratulations to the president and true friend Emmanuel Macron on his election victory," Zelensky wrote on his Twitter account earlier this morning.\n\nMacron is seeking a diplomatic solution to halt the Russian invasion of Ukraine. France has sent significant quantities of weapons to Ukraine and plans more deliveries.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/BNR', 'image': 'https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-04/photo_verybig_214855.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:04'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene," the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media.\n\n3:37pm: Ukraine war has consequences for Asia, EU chief warns neutral India\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine threatens India\'s regional security, the European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Monday during a trip to New Delhi aimed at fostering deeper strategic ties.\n\nVon der Leyen is the latest visiting Western diplomat to press India, which gets most of its arms from Russia, over its neutral stance on the conflict.\n\nBoth the EU and India face challenges from a rising China, and von der Leyen raised the spectre of Beijing\'s partnership with Moscow to warn the war had consequences further afield than Europe.\n\n"The outcome of the war will not only determine the future of Europe but also deeply affect the Indo-Pacific region," she told an audience at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitical conference in New Delhi.\n\n"Russia and China have forged a seemingly unrestrained pact. They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war. Since the beginning of April, just under 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, after some 3.4 million left in March.\n\nThe UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an additional 218,000 citizens of third countries—largely students and migrant workers—have also fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began.\n\nWomen and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.\n\nBeyond the refugees, the IOM estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Ukrainian children have had to flee their homes, including those who remain in the country.\n\n2:45pm: Visit by top US officials sign of improved security situation in Kyiv\n\nA visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday is a strong sign that the security situation in Ukraine\'s capital has improved.

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov.

He added that he had talked with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will visit Moscow and Kyiv this week, to convey a strong message to President Putin to end the war, a truce to be achieved and the evacuation of civilians from dangerous areas to finally occur.\n\nMoscow, for its part, has sent a note to Washington calling for an end to US arms supplies to Ukraine, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said.\n\n"Have we served a note - yes, we have emphasized that it is an unacceptable situation in which the United States is filling Ukraine with weapons," he said, adding that Russia had called for an end to the practice.\n\nBlinken and Austin are the first US government officials to visit Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

Authorities in Kyiv will also demand the release or exchange of their fighters, who are still trapped at the Azovstal plant.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Zelensky spoke with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to mediate a truce in Mariupol. Turkey views "in principle positively" the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine after the end of the war with Russia. This was stated in a statement issued by the presidential institution in Ankara after Erdogan\'s telephone conversation with Zelensky.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene," the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media.\n\n3:37pm: Ukraine war has consequences for Asia, EU chief warns neutral India\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine threatens India\'s regional security, the European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Monday during a trip to New Delhi aimed at fostering deeper strategic ties.\n\nVon der Leyen is the latest visiting Western diplomat to press India, which gets most of its arms from Russia, over its neutral stance on the conflict.\n\nBoth the EU and India face challenges from a rising China, and von der Leyen raised the spectre of Beijing\'s partnership with Moscow to warn the war had consequences further afield than Europe.\n\n"The outcome of the war will not only determine the future of Europe but also deeply affect the Indo-Pacific region," she told an audience at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitical conference in New Delhi.\n\n"Russia and China have forged a seemingly unrestrained pact. They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'...

"The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win," he said. "We believe that we can win, they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support."\n\n7:41am: UK says Russia made minor advances in Ukraine after its shift to Donbas\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the eastern Donbas region, the UK\'s Ministry of Defence has tweeted.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nUkraine\'s defence of the southern city of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 25 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/7NVrOfB161\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/OfcnHgGfR3 — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 25, 2022\n\n6:41am: US aid to Ukraine and neighbours, diplomatic presence in Kyiv\n\nDuring their visit to Kyiv on Sunday – the highest-level US visit since the Russian invasion on February 24 – Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his advisers that the US would provide more than $300 million in foreign military financing and had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition.\n\nMoney will also go to Ukraine\'s regional allies who need to resupply after sending weapons to their neighbour.\n\nThey also said US President Joe Biden would soon announce his nominee for ambassador to Ukraine and that US diplomats who left Ukraine before the war would start returning to the country this coming week.

The next day, EU leaders gathered for an extraordinary summit. At that time, they thought the war would only last a few days…\n\nThis seems like ancient history now.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to EU leaders at that summit via video link. Shortly after, the author of this Brief met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who said leaders reeled in shock because Zelenskyy’s video call seemed like a final goodbye.\n\n“One shudders because this man who is asking for help and support may not be alive in the next 48 hours”, Petkov said.\n\nSince then, it has become apparent that the Russian army was not as efficient as we thought, and Ukrainian resistance is not only heroic but potent.\n\nArms started to arrive in Ukraine, Kyiv became safe enough to receive visits from foreign officials, and Zelenskyy addressed parliaments across the world.\n\nRussia re-hashed its strategy, abandoning plans for total dominance via a puppet government and concentrating on territories in the east and south of Ukraine that it still hopes to capture and retain.\n\nChances for a ceasefire are linked with a scenario in which one of the two sides is close to capitulation. But as long as both sides harbour other ambitions – Ukraine to regain most of its territory and Russia to obtain full access to the Black Sea – it is unrealistic to imagine a peace agreement.\n\nBesides, the West now looks set to offer Ukraine whatever weapons it needs, while Russia has no other option but to fight because a defeat is simply not an option for President Vladimir Putin. The main risk factor remains that Putin might be tempted to use arms of mass destruction at some point.\n\nBut if this war remains conventional, as we hope, it is safe to assume that it may last a very long time. And if this is the case, we must concede the war will transform Europe and possibly the world.\n\nThe EU was blind to internal developments in Russia during the run-up to the war, which sought to restore “the glory” of the USSR by force.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU remains over-dependent on Russian oil and gas and vulnerable to Russian propaganda and policy of sowing divisions.\n\nIn hindsight, we can say that the most naïve country was Germany, perceived until recently as our Union’s leader. Conversely, perhaps the most alert country was Poland, who has been fighting a rule-of-law war with the European Commission – a dispute that looks rather unhelpful in the current context.\n\nWhen Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in 2019 that she had ambitions to lead a ‘geopolitical Commission’, she could not know that she would have no other choice three years on. EU policies are changing, taboos are disappearing, and bureaucrats are being pushed out of their comfort zone.\n\nIf, for example, the EU cannot reach an agreement on sanctioning the oil imports from Russia, it should abandon the unanimity rule, which serves nobody else but Putin. This would also significantly reduce the power of nuisance leaders like Viktor Orban.\n\nIt should be up to the Commission to make sure that detractors are excluded from specific funding and opportunities. This is part of building the EU’s resilience.\n\nWhile the war drags on, it is safe to bet that the EU will change more than it has done in decades.\n\nIt is good for Europe that the French President Emmanuel Macron has won a second mandate and that in Slovenia, Eurosceptic Janez Janša was badly beaten.\n\nIf the mainstream politicians take the social challenges in their countries seriously, the far-right politicians, who have already lost Putin as an icon, will be squeezed into the corner.\n\nEuropeans are capable of solidarity and will show the best of themselves and perhaps Europe will have a new generation of war leaders, as it did after World War II.\n\nThe Roundup\n\nWith the ongoing French EU Council presidency and the upcoming parliamentary elections, Emmanuel Macron will enjoy no grace period in his second mandate and the opposition, both on the left and the right, is more determined than ever to strip the newly re-elected president of his parliamentary majority.\n\nTwitter Inc is nearing a deal to sell itself to Elon Musk for $54.20 per share in cash, the price that he originally offered to the social media company and called his ‘best and final’, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIf you want to read up on how Slovenia fared in its parliamentary election on Sunday, we’ve got you covered: Conservatives are out, a progressive government is in.\n\nEurope’s market for hydrogen-powered taxis is becoming increasingly competitive, with French company Hype, which has developed them in Paris since 2015, being among the frontrunners.\n\nThe EU and India are set to announce closer cooperation and an imminent relaunch of negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement on Monday, as part of Western efforts to help decrease the world’s second-most populous country’s dependence on Russia.\n\nLook out for…\n\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee holds public hearing on encouraging engagement of young people towards achieving sustainable development.\n\nCouncil of Europe holds conference on ‘Speaking Human Rights Online’.\n\nViews are the author’s.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Shared-Link-The-Hub-Article-Templates-Options-44-800x450.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:10'}

Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer. It is probably no longer politically tenable for German politicians to find ways of accommodating Putin, and Germany must at long last wrestle with a reality it has long avoided: Building nuclear power plants is perhaps the only viable path to something close to energy independence.\n\nMacron may realize he has other problems as well; although he outpolled the insurgent Le Pen by 17 percentage points, his right-wing opponent delivered her best showing ever by playing on the fears of rising energy prices stemming partly from Western boycotts, among other issues. At a victory rally, Macron declared that “an answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right.” That includes developing a new policy toward a hostile Russia.\n\n“France needs a better Ostpolitik, and Scholz’s Germany doesn’t seem to have a Europe policy,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution. “Neither of them has really come to grips with what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means for the European security order.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/olaf-scholz-macron-G-7-germany-GettyImages-1238300895.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:16'}

A French military source said the bodies are thought to be real and may have been taken from the town of Hombori in northern Mali, where reports have emerged of human rights abuses being committed by Malian troops traveling with foreign fighters, thought to be from Wagner.\n\nForeign Policy has reviewed a series of images shared by the French Armed Forces but is unable to independently verify them. However, several current and former U.S. officials who track Russia’s presence in West Africa said the images track with the pattern of how Russian-backed mercenaries operate in conflict zones, including their role in committing atrocities against civilians and launching propaganda campaigns to undercut adversaries and garner public favor.\n\n“Perhaps what is most surprising is not that the Russians tried such a false-flag operation but how amateurish and sloppy it was,” said J. Peter Pham, a former U.S. special envoy for the Sahel region. “It does not augur well for the operational competence of the personnel deployed to Mali by Wagner—or whatever organization sent them—much less their strategic sense.”\n\nThe French decision to rapidly disclose the images comes as Western countries, most prominently the United States, are increasingly declassifying and sharing intelligence assessments about Russian activities in Ukraine in a bid to expose Moscow’s plans and rob it of the ability to operate in the shadows. In Ukraine, Western officials and researchers have warned that Russian forces may stage a false-flag operation as a pretext to escalate the conflict. Repeated and unfounded Russian allegations that the United States and Ukraine are developing chemical and biological weapons has led U.S. officials to warn that Moscow may be laying the groundwork to justify its own use of chemical weapons.\n\nAhead of the transfer of control over the military base, French intelligence assessed that Wagner forces might attempt to stage a disinformation operation, according to the French military source, and dispatched an intelligence overflight to monitor the area. On April 20, they observed the dozen or so white men in combat fatigues—presumed to be Wagner mercenaries—unloading equipment at the base in Gossi, accompanied by Malian troops.\n\nThe next day, drone footage taken a few miles east of Gossi showed the same men gathered around a pile of bodies, covering them in sand, while one man was seen filming the corpses. Later that day, a Twitter account known to French analysts to have previously published false allegations in support of Russian activity in the country released a graphic close-up video of the bodies, with the caption: “A video that shows lifeless bodies near the base on Gossi. For those who have any doubts.” The Twitter account has since been closed down.\n\nThe Malian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The Russian Embassy in Washington also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWestern officials estimate that around 1,000 Wagner forces have been deployed to Mali at the invitation of the country’s military junta since December 2021. They arrived as French and European countries began scaling back their involvement in the country, as disputes mounted between European powers and the military junta and public support for the mission began flagging in both France and Mali. The ruling junta expelled France’s ambassador in Mali in January after Paris criticized the military coup, and a month later, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that French troops would withdraw from the country.\n\nWhile Mali continues to grapple with a very real terrorist threat, the introduction of Wagner forces, which have a long track record of reported involvement in atrocities, is likely to further undermine the security situation in the country. Two U.S. and European defense officials said the Russian force, in both size and its military effectiveness, would not be enough to fill the vacuum left by the European withdrawal.\n\n“It underscores that, having seen off the Europeans, the Malian Armed Forces ultimately will have to win on their own—a reality that perhaps the prolonged French-led intervention shielded them from having to face,” Pham said.\n\nRussia’s new military presence in Mali follows the pattern of another of its campaigns for influence in Central Africa, where Russian mercenaries have been deployed to the politically unstable Central African Republic since at least 2017. A 2021 report for the U.N. Security Council determined that Russian mercenaries deployed in CAR committed atrocities during military operations there, including indiscriminately killing civilians and looting. Russian officials denied those reports. At the same time, Moscow has sought to use propaganda, including Russian-produced films in the country, to garner support for its presence and strengthen its ties with President Faustin-Archange Touadéra’s government.\n\nRussia has sought to shore up its flailing military offensive in Ukraine by withdrawing troops as well as mercenaries and foreign fighters from other conflict zones where it maintains a footprint, including Syria, Libya, and CAR. However, Western officials assess that the number of Russian troops and mercenaries deployed to Mali hasn’t changed, and their presence has even been bolstered by recent deliveries of Mi-35M attack helicopters and advanced air radar systems.\n\nHuman Rights Watch released a report this month accusing Malian forces and associated foreign soldiers of massacring an estimated 300 civilian men in central Mali in March, purportedly during counterterrorism operations. Some of the eyewitnesses of the incident believed the foreign troops were Russian.\n\nMali has been embroiled in violent crisis since 2012 amid a rise in violent jihadi groups and armed insurrection movements that were fueled by grievances over the country’s poor governance structures and local conflicts. France first deployed forces to Mali in 2013 to conduct counterterrorism operations and stabilize the country, alongside other European countries and a large U.N. peacekeeping mission. The international intervention has not stemmed the tide of terrorism, however, as groups stepped up attacks and spread south and east to neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\nThe number of violent attacks in the Sahel in 2021 shot up 70 percent—to more than 2,000 incidents—compared with 2020, according to a report released by the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in January. Two extremist groups, the al Qaeda-linked Macina Liberation Front and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, were responsible for a majority of the attacks.', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mali-wagner-group-mass-grave-france-220419_EMA_W_MOPTI-3.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:00'}

Click here for updates from April 24.\n\nMariupol Officials Say New Mass Grave Found\n\nOfficials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new mass grave has been identified north of the city.\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) north of Mariupol.\n\nSatellite photos released over the past several days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nMariupol has been decimated by fierce fighting over the past two months. The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk. The Russian report said oil storage tanks at the facility caught fire around 2 a.m. local time.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires show a burning fire at coordinates that correspond to a Rosneft facility some 70 miles north of the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, adviser to the head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was cited by the Ukrainian news agency Unian as saying that people who live near the burning oil depot were being evacuated.\n\nMoscow has previously blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s top security officials have denied that Kyiv was behind an earlier airstrike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, about 35 miles from the border.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin Meet With Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country’s capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia’s invasion.\n\nThe meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nIt came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia’s campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol.\n\n“Yes, they’re meeting with the president. Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:53:40'}

Police sources have described Pizzi as a man who appears to have grown in influence among the Montreal Mafia over the past decade. The agreement reached with the new owner is detailed in a decision made on April 14 by the RACJ to suspend the bar\u2019s liquor licence despite the change in ownership. It describes how the previous owner was summoned to appear before the board since November 2019 on a request from the Montreal police.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cThe most troubling aspect in the case (was) the presence and the hold, by certain individuals tied to the highest spheres of organized crime in Montreal, over control of the establishment,\u201d Marc Savard, the president of the RACJ, wrote in his decision approving the agreement. Savard noted that a Montreal police investigator corroborated the new owner\u2019s testimony that he has no connections with Salvatore Infantino, the bar\u2019s previous owner, beyond the sale of the bar, and has no ties to organized crime. Infantino is also among the names of eight people who are not allowed on the premises. During the summer of 2016, Pizzi underwent a bail hearing at the Montreal courthouse following his arrest in Project Clemenza, an RCMP investigation into alleged drug traffickers tied to the Montreal Mafia. Infantino testified during the bail hearing in support of Pizzi\u2019s release. He described himself as a childhood friend of Pizzi\u2019s and told the court he was surprised to learn Pizzi was alleged to have been tied to $2.3 million used to finance five shipments of cocaine that were to be smuggled into Canada.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The charges against Pizzi were dropped a year later when the Crown decided it would no longer prosecute cases related to Project Clemenza. Shortly after he was released on bail, an attempt was made on Pizzi\u2019s life on Aug. 8, 2016, while he was driving along Grande-All\u00e9e Ave. in Montreal. A hit man who became an informant and testified during the murder trial of Marie-Jos\u00e9e Viau and Guy Dion last year said that Pizzi was among a list of people that Salvatore Scoppa, the leader of a Calabrian clan in the Montreal Mafia, had sought to have killed. Among a long list of events the Montreal police cited when it asked that Infantino appear before the RACJ, was a dinner held on May 29, 2021, at a restaurant in Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies called Prima Luna \u201cwhere several influential members of organized crime gathered for a soir\u00e9e.\u201d The gathering was held in the restaurant in contravention of COVID-19 measures. Pizzi was reportedly in attendance that night as well as Montreal Mafia leader Francesco Del Balso and longtime members of the Hells Angels. The owners of Prima Luna are scheduled to have a hearing before the RACJ next month to answer questions about the gathering. Other events mentioned include an arson fire set in the same building on Maurice Duplessis Blvd. in 2016, when the business was known as Caf\u00e9 Liana, and an attempted murder on Feb. 4, 2019. pcherry@postmedia.com More On This Topic Man involved in hit on alleged Montreal Mafioso is denied parole Informant says Scoppa brothers wanted to eliminate Sicilians in Montreal Mafia\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nMontreal Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

What they have to understand is if Quebec is bilingual, unfortunately the attraction in North America to English will be so strong it will be a matter of time before we don\u2019t speak French in Quebec and we become Louisiana.\u201d Legault was commenting on news that two new minority language rights parties, one to be called the Canadian Party of Quebec (CaPQ) and the other Mouvement Qu\u00e9bec, are getting organized in time to field candidates in the fall general election. Neither have been officially authorized by \u00c9lections Quebec, but have applications to obtain official party status. Both plan to run candidates throughout Quebec, but are targeting ridings in Montreal, the Townships and Outaouais because of the pockets of English-speaking Quebecers.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The announcement of the creation of the Canadian Party of Quebec was done via a press release published overnight Monday by Eastern Townships language activist Colin Standish. Former mayoralty candidate Balarama Holness announced last week that he was creating Mouvement Qu\u00e9bec. \u201cYes, the Canadian Party of Quebec/Parti canadien du Qu\u00e9bec will be an unapologetically federalist party that tirelessly works for minority rights, socioeconomic justice and linguistic harmony,\u201d Standish said. The party\u2019s platform will be based on six principles. They will be \u201crights are rights are rights, respecting the integrity of the Canadian constitution, bilingualism, educational choice, prosperity for all Quebecers, and rapprochement and reconciliation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The group says it intends to challenge what it describes as Quebec\u2019s political orthodoxy and offers to \u201cfill the void\u201d felt by minority voters in the wake of overhauls of language legislation at the National Assembly (Bill 96) and in Ottawa and other legislation, such as Bill 21 on state secularism. \u201cThe time has come to offer a voice to the voiceless,\u201d especially Quebecers who feel betrayed and abandoned by the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec and the Quebec Liberal Party,\u201d Standish said. The news took the traditional parties by surprise, but mostly risks rocking the boat of the struggling Liberals. With Liberal Leader Dominique Anglade absent from the legislature for a speaking engagement Tuesday, it was up to Liberal house leader Andr\u00e9 Fortin to field the questions. He rapidly shifted the Liberal line of attack to a warning about vote-splitting.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cYou may well end up with more people elected from the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec,\u201d Fortin told reporters. \u201cIf you want people here, in the assembly, who represent your views, if you want people who oppose those bills, then the Liberal Party represents your views.\u201d Reached Tuesday, Holness launched a few arrows at the new party, which will now be competing for similar voters with his party. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether Montrealers will be inspired by Colin,\u201d Holness said. \u201cI think their policies are connected to the current political climate, but are they connected to the people? I don\u2019t think so. \u201cHe\u2019s from the Eastern Townships, has never lived in Montreal and won\u2019t be campaigning in Montreal because he doesn\u2019t live here. For me, this (other party) is a lot of noise.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content He noted his organization has a track record of being able to organize and debate issues from the last municipal campaign. \u201cAnyone can go and register a party and say we are against Bill 96,\u201d Holness said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have the bandwidth, the personnel and the credibility to make the kind of impact Mouvement Montr\u00e9al had.\u201d Later, in an interview with the Montreal Gazette, Standish said he did not want to get into a feud with Holness, but noted his party\u2019s policies are the result of discussions and debates in the community. \u201cWe feel they are going to resonate with all Quebecers, French, English-speaking, newcomers and Indigenous. We have our plan. We\u2019re confident. This is not a fly-by-night idea for us. It is intellectually and morally and legally sound principles.\u201d He challenged Legault\u2019s views that French is in decline, noting 80 per cent of Quebecers are mother-tongue-French. \u201cThe decline of French in Quebec is a myth,\u201d Standish said. Standish said the Canadian Party of Quebec will be officially launched some time in mid-May. pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/philipauthier More On This Topic Voters will have another option this fall: the Canadian Party of Quebec Montreal needs voice in National Assembly, Holness says in previewing new party\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nMontreal Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

It\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d Montreal has set a goal of becoming zero waste by 2030. Interim opposition leader Aref Salem expressed support for the measure. \u201cOf course, in 2022, we cannot continue to accept 40 million plastic bags being sent to the recycling centre,\u201d he said. However, he raised concerns about the future of free local weekly newspapers that are also delivered in the Publisac bag. Salem also expressed worries about how the ban on universal door-to-door distribution would affect low-income residents who depend on the flyers to shop for food, especially in today\u2019s inflationary context.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The Ensemble Montr\u00e9al opposition forced an amendment shortening the delegation of power to the city to enforce the measure from a proposed five years to two-and-a-half years. It also requires the city to report to council on the bylaw\u2019s impact by September 2024. Plante promised measures to help local weeklies survive the loss of their current method of delivery. Currently, flyers are distributed under an opt-out system, where residents who don\u2019t want them can put up a sign in their doorway refusing them. However, critics say unwanted advertising matter is often distributed even to homes with \u201cno flyers\u201d stickers. The new system will be an opt-in one, where people who want flyers will have to request them. The advertising matter will also no longer be allowed to be delivered in a plastic bag.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content TC Transcontinental, which publishes and distributes the Publisac, said two weeks ago it\u2019s unfortunate that consumers could lose access to flyers that help them economize just when inflation is causing \u201cunprecedented price increases,\u201d and vowed \u201cto assert our rights and those of our customers, if necessary.\u201d The company has said the opt-in model is not viable for door-to-door distribution. On Monday, it announced it would stop distributing the Publisac to households in Mirabel, after the Quebec Superior Court rejected a motion by the company seeking to overturn a 2019 bylaw imposing an opt-in system in the city 50 kilometres northwest of Montreal. TC Transcontinental said it would turn to Canada Post to deliver flyers to customers who request them, resulting in the elimination of 16 jobs.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content In other council news: \u2014 The project to build platform screen doors on several stations on the Orange Line is only on hold, not cancelled, Plante said, after Salem questioned her on a report in the Montreal Gazette revealing that the $200-million project was quietly shelved in December. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that we put it on ice for a while,\u201d she said. Plante said her administration chose to maintain transit service for essential-service workers during the pandemic, despite a sharp drop in ridership. While the barrier doors are important, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Transport de Montr\u00e9al (STM) has had to implement budget cuts to make up for the loss in revenues, she said. \u2014 Montreal will hold a pilot project allowing people to bring dogs on a leash on the m\u00e9tro, under an opposition motion adopted unanimously. Currently, dogs are only allowed on the transit network in a cage or pet carrier, unless they are guide dogs, which are permitted. In December, the SPCA raised a 16,546-name petition to allow leashed dogs on the STM.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The motion calls for the pilot project to be implemented by the end of the year. It also calls on the city and STM to launch a public awareness campaign on the topic. \u2014 Councillors also approved an opposition motion to request that the Quebec government amend the city\u2019s charter so that two independent civilian members with expertise on racial profiling and human rights may be added to the nine-member public security committee. The committee is now made up of city and borough councillors and two suburban mayors. The proposal was among 38 recommendations made in June 2020 by the Office de consultation publique de Montr\u00e9al (OCPM), which held hearings on systemic racism and discrimination within the city and its police force. \u2014 Council also unanimously passed a motion introduced by Snowdon councillor Sonny Moroz to designate May as Jewish Heritage Month in Montreal. On Monday, councillors approved a declaration naming recognizing April 27 and 28 as Yom HaShoah day, commemorating victims of the Holocaust. mscott@postmedia.com\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nMontreal Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

However, Putin's demand on Crimea and Donbas is precisely what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently said would end any proposed deal.\n\nPeace negotiations halted after Ukraine accused Russia of committing war crimes by massacring civilians in communities near the capital city of Kyiv. Last week, the Financial Times reported a Kremlin spokesperson said a document containing demands that Russia wanted met before ceasing its attacks was delivered to Ukraine, but Zelensky has said he did not receive any such document.\n\nOn Saturday, Zelensky was asked during a press conference how he would respond during peace negotiations if Russia pushed for potential independence referendums in the eastern territories currently controlled by Russian military forces. Zelensky responded that if such conditions about the territories were demanded, he would end the talks.\n\n\"If our people in Mariupol are killed, if pseudo-referendums are announced in the new pseudo-republics, Ukraine will withdraw from any negotiation process,\" Zelensky said, according to The Kyiv Independent.\n\nAlong with talk of reviving peace talks, Guterres and Putin also discussed proposals for humanitarian assistance and the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones. A statement released from the U.N. indicated that Putin agreed to allow the U.N. and the Red Cross to work toward getting civilians evacuated from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, where Ukrainians are holding out from Russian forces.\n\nImages and videos of Tuesday's meeting show the long table Putin used when meeting other leaders before the February 24 invasion of Ukraine, and the two leaders sat distantly apart.\n\nAccording to Axios and the Russia news agency TASS, Putin brought up Kosovo declaring itself independent of Serbia in 2008. He asked Guterres whether that event would be similar to Donbas declaring itself independent from Ukraine and Moscow recognizing the action, which resulted in Guterres saying the U.N. does not recognize Kosovo's independence.\n\nZelensky repeated multiple times throughout his Saturday press conference that he is ready to hold peace talks face-to-face with Putin. Although he said he didn't want to meet with the Russian leader, Zelensky noted that \"the war can be stopped by the person who started it.\"\n\n\"I want to stop the war and end it. There is a diplomatic path and a military one. Any healthy person chooses the diplomatic path because he knows that even if it is difficult, it can prevent the loss of millions of people,\" Zelensky said.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry and the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment.",

        "text": "The sun rises behind the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington on Nov. 10, 2020. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nBiden Administration Urges Supreme Court to Let It Drop \u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 Program\n\nThe Biden administration told the Supreme Court on April 26 that it should not have to continue operating the Trump-era \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program that required non-Mexican asylum-seekers arriving at the southern border to wait in Mexico for processing.\n\nThe case at hand is Biden v. Texas, court file 21-954. The high court agreed on February 18 to hear the case, an appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. One hour was set aside for the hearing, but it ran 1 hour and 47 minutes.\n\nUpon assuming office, Biden halted enrollments in the program, part of the Migrant Protection Protocols enforced by then-President Donald Trump, which was created to discourage individuals from making fraudulent asylum claims.\n\nThese Migrant Protection Protocols, approved by Congress and signed into law during the Clinton administration, had not been acted upon until then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced in December 2018 that they would be implemented. She said the goal was to curtail the so-called catch-and-release system, in which individuals made fraudulent asylum claims, knowing they would be let into the United States and able to stay for years before their court appearance.\n\nUnder Biden, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a memorandum providing that, effective Jan. 21, 2021, it would \u201csuspend new enrollments in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), pending further review of the program. Aliens who aren\u2019t already enrolled in MPP should be processed under other existing legal authorities.\u201d\n\nDays later, Biden signed three new executive orders aimed at undoing Trump-era immigration policies. One of the documents, Biden said during a ceremony at the White House, \u201corders a full review of the previous administration\u2019s harmful and counterproductive immigration policies, basically across the board.\u201d\n\nBut in August 2021, at the request of Texas and Missouri, federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of the Northern District of Texas, a Trump appointee, ordered the government to keep the MPP policy in effect until it was \u201clawfully rescinded.\u201d The Biden administration had failed to properly justify ending the policy and failed to uphold a 1996 law requiring the detention of certain migrants, the trial court judge found. The 5th Circuit sided with the two states.\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said during oral arguments at the Supreme Court that Biden\u2019s Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas \u201cexercised his statutory discretion to make a policy judgment\u201d and \u201cfound that the benefits of MPP were outweighed by its domestic, humanitarian, and foreign policy costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet, the lower courts ordered DHS to reinstate MPP in perpetuity, requiring ongoing negotiations with Mexico to send thousands of non-citizens into its territory. That was error,\u201d Prelogar said.\n\nMayorkas \u201cshould be allowed to finally put his policy decision into effect,\u201d she said.\n\nSection 1225 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) gives the DHS secretary \u201cdiscretionary return authority \u2026 not a mandate,\u201d she added. \u201cNothing in the statutory text or history compels DHS to use MPP.\u201d\n\nNeither Texas nor Missouri have given examples of any official interpreting the section as a mandate. But on their interpretation of the law, \u201cevery presidential administration, in an unbroken line for the past quarter-century, has been in open violation of the INA,\u201d Prelogar said.\n\n\u201cThe courts\u2019 interpretation compels sensitive foreign policy negotiations and would require transformative changes to the government\u2019s border operations,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Congress had wanted to mandate those results, it would have spoken clearly.\u201d\n\nResponding to Justice Clarence Thomas, Prelogar said the lower courts\u2019 rulings intrude on the federal government\u2019s foreign policy powers.\n\n\u201cThe particular interpretation of the statute that the district court adopted here implicates grave and serious foreign policy implications,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOf course, the executive branch has primary responsibility for managing foreign relations and conducting those kinds of negotiations. And I think that if Congress had intended to override the executive\u2019s ordinary discretion that it enjoys with respect to that kind of foreign policy relationship, then, at the very least, it should have made that intent express in the statute.\u201d\n\nThe federal official also said it is impossible to detain everyone who arrives at the southern border because Congress hasn\u2019t allocated enough money to cover immigration detention beds.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts seemed to side with the states when he told Prelogar that while he was \u201csympathetic\u201d to her concern that the government \u201ccan\u2019t detain enough people,\u201d that isn\u2019t the Supreme Court\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a position where the facts have sort of overtaken the law,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut, in that situation, what are we supposed to do? It\u2019s still our job to say what the law is. And if we say what the law is and you tell us we can\u2019t do anything about it, where do you think that leaves us?\u201d\n\nTexas Solicitor General Judd E. Stone II said the law generally requires that the U.S. detain migrants or send them back to Mexico. If it lacks the resources to detain them, it should return them to Mexico so they can wait there for asylum processing, he said.\n\nThe Biden administration, Stone added, has admitted it is not complying with the immigration detention provisions of the INA.\n\n\u201cPetitioners suggest that no administration, no executive, has fully complied with their detention obligations. That certainly doesn\u2019t prove that past administrations assumed those obligations could be \u2026 shirked in the event that they preferred not to use one of Congress\u2019s allowed statutory tools, but I have no reason to think that that\u2019s incorrect.\u201d\n\nJustice Thomas pushed back, saying: \u201cAssuming you\u2019re right, wouldn\u2019t it be odd for Congress to leave in place a statute that would appear to be impossible to comply with?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Your Honor,\u201d Stone replied.\n\n\u201cCongress \u2026 as my friends on the other side mentioned, had this mandatory detention obligation for over a century. It has added authorities to enable the executive to attempt to meet it additionally,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Congress doesn\u2019t provide enough money to enforce the provisions of the law, \u201cThen the executive has to do the best it can \u2026 with the amount of money that\u2019s been appropriated to it and the other lawful \u2026 authorities it\u2019s been provided.\u201d",

Republican-led states and conservative groups have sided with Texas and Missouri.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Louisiana said on Monday that he intends to rule that US authorities cannot immediately proceed with plans to lift pandemic restrictions that empowered US agents at the Mexico border to turn back migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum, a rule known as Title 42.\n\nUS district judge Robert Summerhays stated his intention after a hearing in a case brought by 21 states against the Biden administration.\n\nThe judge said both sides would confer regarding the specific terms of a temporary restraining order and would attempt to reach agreement.\n\nThe ruling would upend a decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to terminate the Title 42 border order by May 23.\n\nBiden has struggled to implement what he pledged while campaigning would be a more humane and orderly system at the US-Mexico border amid record numbers of migrants arrested while crossing without papers.\n\nThe judge\u2019s statement is a victory for Republicans who have been escalating warnings for weeks about the ending of Title 42 leading to a crisis at the border and increased illegal immigration, slamming what, for example, Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry called \u201cthis enormous threat to our national security.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nThe CDC said in early April that Title 42 was no longer needed to fight Covid due to the increased availability of vaccines, therapeutics and other tools to counter the disease.\n\nIn the Louisiana lawsuit, a coalition of 21 states led by Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri, all with Republican attorneys general, are seeking to stop the termination of the order put in place under Donald Trump.\n\nSeparately, Texas filed a different lawsuit on April 22 that also seeks to halt the title 42 termination and the outcome of that is awaited.\n\nAdvocates are also concerned that those waiting for months across the border end up repeatedly crossing unlawfully and being arrested multiple times, artificially inflating statistics about migrant numbers.",

        "text": "The Twitter logo is displayed on a banner outside the New York Stock Exchange, on Nov. 7, 2013. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)\n\nCensorship No More? The Political Fallout of Elon Musk Buying Twitter\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk has been highly critical of Twitter\u2019s restrictions on speech. With his purchase of the social media platform and his goal of creating an open and transparent environment, there has been some discussion about the impact this could have on U.S. elections moving forward.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter is a \u201chuge deal,\u201d according to Hogan Gidley, the former White House spokesman under President Donald Trump.\n\nMembers of the media, celebrities, and elected officials are among the most active users, Gidley told Steve Lance, host of NTD\u2019s Capitol Report. This is significant since the left controls the majority of those people or entities, he added.\n\nAs a result, when information reaches the platform, you\u2019ll witness \u201cin unison, lockstep ideology of one side of an issue.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center study, most tweets come from a small group of highly active Twitter users. About 10 percent of Twitter users in the United States account for almost 80 percent of all tweets. These accounts tweet 138 times every month, compared to the median Twitter user that tweets twice a month.\n\nA separate October 2021 Media Research Center report discovered that the Big Tech firms censored far more Republican members of Congress than their Democratic counterparts: 54-to-1.\n\nThe announcement of the buyout has outraged the left, Gidley said, not because they could be blocked on Twitter, but because Twitter could refuse to censor those they disagree with.\n\nGidley feels that social media platforms influenced the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDuring the campaign, Twitter took an unprecedented step to block the spread of reports concerning Hunter Biden\u2019s emails due to questions about \u201cthe origins of the materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t tweet about it at the campaign. We couldn\u2019t talk about it in our direct messaging. We sure couldn\u2019t do ads on it. Even though we had ads, they wouldn\u2019t run the ads, because they collectively said it was Russian disinformation,\u201d Gidley said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a serious issue. It has really influenced the outcome of elections. And quite frankly, it is a source of true evil in this country, to rip away the First Amendment freedoms.\u201d\n\nConservatives cheered the news as they anticipate free speech will be prioritized once again, with the social network expected to abandon censorship measures like shadow banning and permanent bans.\n\nIndividuals on the other side of the political spectrum have expressed their concern about the risks to public discourse, despite Musk\u2019s main goal to resuscitate the idea of open communications.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear. Elon Musk\u2019s effort to buy Twitter is not the only threat to free communications and debate in the United States,\u201d said the Open Markets Institute, a non-profit organization to fighting monopolies and bolstering anti-trust law and competition policy, in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe size, scope, and business models of Facebook, Google, and Amazon also pose a wide variety of often extreme threats to American democracy and the basic rights of citizens. That\u2019s why law enforcers and Congress should view this deal as an opportunity to firmly re-establish clear bans on any manipulation of communications by essential platforms, and to eliminate all business models that rely on such manipulation.\u201d\n\nOthers have iterated the view that the public needs to be worried about Twitter in the hands of Musk. Many prominent left-leaning individuals have pledged to leave the platform, including actress Mia Farrow, former Governor Howard Dean, author and former professional wrestler Mick Foley, and New York Times columnist Charles Blow.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) decried Musk\u2019s acquisition, calling it \u201cdangerous for our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne billionaire\u2014whose estimated net worth has gotten about 10 times larger since the start of the pandemic\u2014is about to have the power to decide how millions of people can communicate with each other. It\u2019s dangerous for our democracy to have so much power in so few hands,\u201d the 2020 presidential candidate posted on Twitter.\n\nIt is unclear what critics of Musk\u2019s ownership of Twitter are concerned about. He stated before the announcement that he hopes \u201cthat even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, whether policies and practices on the website will change heading into the 2022 electoral cycle or not remains to be seen.\n\nTwitter ignited tremendous controversy shortly before the 2020 presidential election when the website blocked links to the New York Post\u2019s story on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop. But Twitter\u2019s meddling has been apparent for years, says Jeff Brain, the CEO of CloutHub, an online networking platform for community, social, and political engagement.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until only 2020,\u201d Brain told The Epoch Times. \u201cI was there in 2018 and I was there in 2016. As we head closer to the election, you see a lot more people who have important voices and you see stories being suppressed.\u201d\n\nCensorship should not be incorporated into the workings of social media platforms because they \u201care the modern-day talent squares,\u201d Brain noted.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a voice on these platforms, then you don\u2019t matter,\u201d he added. \u201cThese platforms determine the policy in your neighborhood as well as Washington DC, and people need to be able to speak their mind and hear all the facts.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki talks to reporters during the daily news conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on March 14, 2022. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nThe White House remarked that the U.S. government might need to look into reforming Section 230. This is a federal rule that says, \u201cNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d\n\nWhile the Biden administration refused to comment on Musk\u2019s deal to buy Twitter, press secretary Jen Psaki shared Biden\u2019s concern about the power of social media.\n\n\u201cOur concerns are not new,\u201d Psaki told reporters Monday. \u201cThe president has long talked about his concerns about the power of social media platforms, including Twitter and others, to spread misinformation.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the elephant in the room is Trump\u2019s suspended account. Former president confirmed to multiple news outlets Monday that he would not be returning to Twitter, adding that he would begin participating on Truth Social soon.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be going back on Twitter,\u201d Trump told CNBC\u2019s Joe Kernen. \u201cI will be on Truth Social within the week. It\u2019s on schedule. We have a lot of people signed up. I like Elon Musk. I like him a lot. He\u2019s an excellent individual. We did a lot for Twitter when I was in the White House. I was disappointed by the way I was treated by Twitter. I won\u2019t be going back on Twitter.\u201d\n\nEmel Akan contributed to this report.",

        "channel": "politico.com",
        "text": "\u201cNobody cares about that. ... Nobody but the media and journalists,\u201d said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a distraction that some New York Times reporters would rather report on things that Americans don\u2019t care about, instead of focusing on what\u2019s causing the inflation, which is the reckless spending these guys are doing. Those are the issues. The tape\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nWith Trump himself also seeming to revel in the power he exerted through the McCarthy-tape episode, its effect on the California Republican\u2019s future speakership prospects is looking questionable so far. That includes the new Times tape released Tuesday night, which featured McCarthy saying Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was \u201cputting people in jeopardy\u201d and criticizing Rep. Mo Brooks\u2019 (R-Ala.) behavior surrounding the riot. In the same meeting, McCarthy and his leadership team also criticized the rhetoric of two other members\u2019 surrounding the Jan. 6 attack: Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-Col.) and Barry Moore (R-Ala.).\n\nWithin hours, Gaetz released a fiery statement criticizing the Republican leader and others.\n\n\u201cRep. McCarthy and Rep. Scalise held views about President Trump and me that they shared on sniveling calls with Liz Cheney, not us,\u201d Gaetz said in a statement. \u201cThis is the behavior of weak men, not leaders.\u201d\n\nOther members specifically named in the story held their fire when asked about the McCarthy tape on Tuesday night, with several pointing the blame at the media instead.\n\n\u201cThe RINOs engineering this story to promote their own selfish agenda won\u2019t be around next year to prop up the Democrats\u2019 destructive Big Government scheme,\u201d said Moore.\n\nBoebert said, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything like that, goodness.\u201d\n\nAnd unlike the first tape, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was also included as suggesting that what Gaetz did could be \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen what they\u2019re referring to,\u201d Scalise told reporters Tuesday night of the latest tape, which includes a comment from him describing Gaetz\u2019s behavior as \u201cpotentially illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not surprising to me that the liberal media wants to keep talking about Jan. 6,\u201d Scalise added. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t want to focus on all the crises that President Biden\u2019s created, from inflation to gas prices to the border.\u201d\n\nAs House Republicans started to digest the new McCarthy recording, even some Trump allies who voted to block certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory were undeterred about his questionable denial of the earlier tape.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who\u2019s also close to McCarthy, said simply that \u201cI\u2019m for Donald Trump being the next president and Kevin McCarthy being the next speaker.\u201d\n\nStill, not all Republicans are ready to let the tapes drama fade. They could be easy ammunition for Republicans who want to squeeze McCarthy for concessions or for new conference members who want to make a name for themselves with the party base as ready to challenge leadership.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who chaired the Trump-allied House Freedom Caucus until January, told the conservative One America News Network that McCarthy\u2019s comments in the audio \u201cundermined\u201d colleagues who had voted to object to the election.\n\nBiggs added to OANN that McCarthy wasn\u2019t \u201ccandid\u201d with other House Republicans that a potential Trump-resignation call was under consideration, and also rapped the GOP leader\u2019s recorded observations about removing some vocal Trump acolytes from social media.\n\nStill, few Republicans were willing to criticize their leader when they arrived back in the Capitol on Tuesday night, their first in-person gathering since the explosive New York Times report last Thursday.\n\nAlabama Rep. Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, argued that the audio was a \u201cnothingburger\u201d that was taken \u201ccompletely out of context.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were talking about if they had the impeachment hearings, and he was impeached,\u201d Rogers said of Trump. McCarthy, he added, was merely offering a recommendation that Trump step aside before Democrats successfully removed him from the White House.\n\nIn the early days of January 2021, at the time of McCarthy\u2019s recorded call, some House Republicans were wagering that the Senate could vote to convict Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all inside baseball. Not a single constituent brought up that issue to me,\u201d Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) said of the McCarthy tape as he walked out of a meeting of senior Republicans.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s talking about it,\u201d Davis added. \u201cAnd frankly, I can\u2019t wait till Speaker McCarthy is sworn in.\u201d\n\nThe Times\u2019 initial report on McCarthy\u2019s post-insurrection comments \u2014 followed a day later by its release of audio from a private GOP meeting \u2014 jolted the House Republican conference at a time when many of its members are eager for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol to retreat from view. McCarthy\u2019s members would much prefer to focus on their efforts to retake the majority come November.\n\nIn the recording, McCarthy is heard telling then-GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) that he was \u201cseriously thinking\u201d of speaking to Trump directly about whether he should resign after the attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe California Republican also told his leadership team on the tape that Trump had personally acknowledged at least some role in goading the rioters that day (which POLITICO reported at the time , citing multiple people with knowledge of the conversation).\n\nTrump \u201ctold me he does have some responsibility for what happened and he\u2019d need to acknowledge that,\u201d McCarthy said in the phone call.\n\nMcCarthy briefly addressed the audio in a meeting Tuesday evening with Republican members of leadership and ranking members, four sources in the room told POLITICO. McCarthy told them he didn\u2019t bring up the resignation scenario to Trump, nor did he raise the topic to the broader GOP conference, warning his members not to let the issue divide them.\n\nSources say that the attendees in this meeting, which is stacked with his allies, were all behind the GOP leader and that no one in the meeting sought to challenge him on it.\n\nSome close to Trump have suggested the former president is not angry about the audio \u2014 instead, he sees it as a sign of his power because both the Senate and House GOP leaders appeared ready to turn on him after the Capitol siege and have since softened their approach.\n\nOf course, that could change; others say Trump is known for sitting on information that he can later use to deploy against someone who has slighted him.\n\nIn Biggs\u2019 interview with OANN, he took particular issue with Cheney\u2019s participation in the discussion about how to respond to Trump, despite the fact that the call occurred when she would still be expected to participate as a member of GOP leadership. Serious efforts to oust her from the conference\u2019s upper echelons didn\u2019t get underway until weeks after the taped call.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly undermining when we were back in the heat of that\u201d time after the riot by Trump supporters, Biggs told the conservative outlet. \u201cAnd we have a leader basically negotiating with Liz Cheney over whether he should resign or not, [which] becomes a huge trust issue for me.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, notably, didn\u2019t quite see Biggs\u2019 remarks as suggesting that the recording could affect his trust in his leader.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what he said,\u201d McCarthy said of Biggs in a brief interview Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cDid you ask Jim Jordan?\u201d the minority leader added, saying that the matter didn\u2019t come up in GOP meetings that afternoon.",

        "text": "Sen. Rand Paul clashed with Secretary of State Antony on Tuesday as he claimed the Biden administration had pushed Vladimir Putin into invading Ukraine, by supporting its bid to join N.A.T.O., and that Moscow's aggression could be explained by the fact it was attacking former Soviet Union members.\n\nHis comments brought quick accusations that the Republican was parroting Kremlin talking points.\n\nAnd during a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee it brought heavy pushback from Blinken amid discussion of Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\nPaul said the administration should not have publicly backed Ukraine's wish to join N.A.T.O. in September last year.\n\nBlinken and other officials, he said, had 'been beating the drums to admit Ukraine\" to the alliance.\n\n'There could have been voices before this invasion instead of agitating for something that we knew our adversary absolutely hated and said was a red line, as recently as last September, before you signed the agreement once again agitating for N.A.T.O. Russia said that it was a red line,' said Paul.\n\n'Now there is no justification for the invasion. I'm not saying that. But there are reasons for the invasion.'\n\nSen. Rand Paul on Tuesday criticized the Biden administration for 'beating the drums' to admit Ukraine to N.A.T.O., suggesting it was the reason for Russia's invasion\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken pushed back on Paul's claims, saying Moscow invaded because Vladimir Putin did not believe in Ukraine's right to exist independently\n\nFirefighters work extinguishing a fire on a commercial area following a rocket hit in Saltivka neighborhood, Kharkiv City, Ukraine\n\nThe Kremlin and its allies have frequently said they were concerned at N.A.T.O. expansion in eastern Europe and cited it as one of the reasons for the military buildup around Ukraine before the invasion.\n\nPaul continued to say that N.A.T.O. membership could have meant U.S. soldiers fighting with Russia.\n\n'Had they been or are they to become part of NATO. that means US soldiers will be fighting in Ukraine and that's something I very much oppose,' he said.\n\nBlinken disputed his claims.\n\n'My judgement is different,' he said.\n\n'If you look at the countries that Russia has attacked over the last years - Georgia, leaving forces in Transnistria, Moldova, and then repeatedly Ukraine - these were countries that were not part of N.A.T.O.\n\n'It has not attacked N.A.T.O. countries for probably a very good reason.'\n\nPaul responded. 'You could also argue the countries they have attacked were part of Russia... ' he said before correcting himself: 'Part of the Soviet Union.'\n\nBlinken said: 'I firmly disagree with with that proposition. It is the fundamental right of these countries to decide their own future and their own destiny.'\n\nPaul again says the countries in question had been members of the Soviet Union for decades before its collapse.\n\n'But that does not give Russia the right to attack them,' said Blinken. 'On the contrary.'\n\nHe said the U.S. had sought to engage Putin about Moscow's concerns but it came to nothing.\n\nUkrainian servicemen fire with a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launch system, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in Luhansk Region, Ukraine April 26\n\nWestern nations have upped the supply of heavy weapons in the past couple of weeks to counter the threat from Russia. Here pro-Russian troops are seen atop an armoured vehicle in the southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine, on April 21\n\n'It is abundantly clear in President Putin's own words that this was never about Ukraine, being potentially part of N.A.T.O.,' he added.\n\n'And it was always about his belief that Ukraine does not deserve to be a sovereign, independent country that it must be reassumed into Russia in one form or another.'\n\nSeveral conservatives have criticized the Biden administration for supporting Ukraine's ambition to join N.A.T.O.\n\nEarlier U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that 'saber rattling' rhetoric from Moscow and threats of nuclear war were 'very dangerous and unhelpful.'\n\nDuring a visit to Germany he hit back at Russia's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov who said that Western leaders risked a third world war by supplying heavy weapons to Ukraine.\n\n'That kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful,' Austin said.\n\n'Nobody wants to see a nuclear war happen. It's a war where all sides lose.\n\n'And so rattling of sabers and, you know, dangerous rhetoric is clearly unhelpful and something that we won't engage in.'\n\nAustin spoke after hosting defense talks at Ramstein Air Base involving more than 40 countries seeking to speed and synchronize supply of weapons to Kyiv.\n\nSeveral nations have stepped up the supply of long range weapons - such as howitzer artillery systems - as the war enters a crucial new phase and Russia focuses on the eastern Donbas region.\n\nAustin was also asked about his recent controversial comments that the U.S. wanted to 'weaken' Russia, and he did not back down.\n\n'We do want to make it harder for Russia to threaten its neighbours and leave them less able to do that,' he said.\n\nMoscow's war machine had been badly degraded by 62 days of war, he continued.\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin slammed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for spreading dangerous rhetoric on Tuesday. 'That kind of rhetoric is very dangerous and unhelpful,' he said during a visit to Germany, a day after Lavrov accused N.A.T.O. of waging a proxy war in Ukraine, bringing the 'very serious' risk of a nuclear confrontation\n\nPro-Russian troops, including fighters of the Chechen special forces unit, stand in front of the destroyed administration building of Azovstal Iron and Steel Works during Ukraine-Russia conflict in the southern port city of Mariupol\n\n'They've lost a lot of a lot of equipment. They've used a lot of precision guided munitions,' he said.\n\n'They've lost a major surface combatant [vessel], and so they are in fact, in terms of military capability, weaker than when it started.\n\n'It'll be harder for them for them to replace some of this capability as they go forward because of the sanctions and the trade restrictions that have been placed on them.\n\n'And so we would like to make sure again, that they don't have the same type of capability to bully their neighbours that we that we saw at the outset of this of this conflict.\n\nEarlier Lavrov, claimed N.A.T.O. was now fighting a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine, bring a 'very serious' risk the conflict could go nuclear.\n\nSpeaking on Russian state TV on Monday night, accused Western leaders of risking a third world war by supplying heavy weapons to Ukraine with the goal of 'wearing down the Russian army' - an aim he described as an 'illusion'.\n\nAccusing NATO and its allies of attempting to bully Russia on the international stage, Lavrov said that tensions between east and west are now worse than during the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War.\n\nAsked directly about the possibility of a nuclear war, he replied: 'The risks are very significant. I do not want the danger to be artificially inflated [but] it is serious, real. It cannot be underestimated.'",

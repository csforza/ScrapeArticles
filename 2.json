Others feature images from Brussels, Milan, Amsterdam and Hamburg contrasted with the suffering in Ukraine.\n\nFurther posters focus on the continued purchase of oil from Russia by Western countries. \u201cBlood oil funds Russia genocide in Ukraine,\u201d says one. \u201cDo you like the smell of g\u0336a\u0336s\u0336o\u0336l\u0336i\u0336n\u0336e\u0336 Ukrainian blood?\u201d asks another.\n\n\u201cWe are starting the special billboard campaign #StopRussiaNow to awaken consciences,\u201d said Morawiecki. \u201cWhat is happening on the streets of Ukrainian cities shakes our conscience, but for too short a time. Too soon our partners in western and southern Europe would like to return to normality.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe remember Russian enslavement well, what it is like to live under someone else\u2019s boot\u2026[so] we have a special mandate to awaken consciences in western Europe,\u201d he continued. \u201cGermany, France, Austria and Italy must do as much as possible to stop the war and end funding for Putin\u2019s war machine.\u201d\n\nThe European Union has already imposed a number of sanctions against Russia and Russian individuals in response to the invasion of Ukraine. But Poland\u2019s government has consistently argued for tougher measures, saying that existing ones have not done enough to prevent or discourage the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cWe need crushing sanctions, much stronger than those that have been imposed so far,\u201d said Morawiecki today. \u201cOur job is to convince our partners in Western Europe to act faster and stronger for a free Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister recently directly criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for prioritising business interests over Ukrainian victims and French President Emmanuel Macron for trying to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. Macron hit back by accusing Morawiecki of interfering in the French elections on behalf of Marine Le Pen.\n\nWhile Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party initially refrained from direct criticism of Hungary \u2013 a close ally \u2013 for its lack of support for Ukraine and opposition to tougher sanctions on Russia, earlier this month PiS chairman Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski expressed his disappointment regarding Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s approach.\n\nRussia has \"committed genocide\" in Ukraine and must face severe international repercussions, says Poland's PM. He criticised Macron for holding talks with Putin (\"Would you negotiate with Hitler?\") and Scholz for prioritising German business interests https://t.co/GGRX0hOypT \u2014 Notes from Poland \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@notesfrompoland) April 4, 2022\n\nPoland had previously been one of Europe\u2019s largest importers of Russian oil, but the government pledged last month to end all imports of oil, gas and coal from Russia by the end of this year. It admits that its embargo on coal may violate EU rules, but said that it \u201ccannot wait any longer\u201d for Brussels to act.\n\nPolish officials were also among the first to warn that genocide may be taking place in Ukraine. President Andrzej Duda said as early as 2 March, six days after the invasion, that Russian actions \u201cbear the hallmarks of genocide\u201d. Polish prosecutors have been helping the International Criminal Court investigate crimes against humanity.\n\nAs well placing billboards in western European cities, the new campaign will also feature conferences organised by Polish diplomats with the presence of Ukrainian ambassadors, the government revealed.\n\nMain image credit: KPRM (under CC BY 3.0 PL)",

            "text": "KYIV: Russian forces tried to storm a steel plant sheltering soldiers and civilians in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol , and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he would meet Sunday in his nation's capital with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Zelenskyy in a news conference gave few details about the logistics of his upcoming encounter with Blinken and Austin but said he expected results \u2014 \u201cnot just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons.\u201dIt would be the first high-level US trip to Kyiv since before the war began on Feb. 24.While visiting Poland in March, Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil to meet with the country's foreign minister.Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a US leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris.Russia's effort in Mariupol is aimed at crushing the last pocket of resistance in the city, a place of deep symbolic and strategic value to Moscow. Completing its capture would give Russia its biggest victory yet, after a nearly two-month siege reduced much of the city to a smoking ruin.In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces also pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine A 3-month-old baby girl was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, officials said. Zelenskyy said 18 more were wounded. The Ukrainian news agency UNIAN said the baby's mother, Valeria Glodan, and grandmother also were killed, citing social media posts from the baby's father and others.\u201cThe war started when this baby was 1 month old. Can you imagine what is happening?\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThey are just bastards. ... I don't have any other words for it, just bastards.\u201dThe Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.The command post was hit on Friday, killing two generals and critically wounding another, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency said in a statement. The Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.The fate of the Ukrainians in the sprawling and besieged seaside steel mill in Mariupol, where Russia says its forces have taken the rest of the city, wasn't immediately clear.A Ukrainian military unit on Saturday released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun.\u201cWe want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,\u201d one woman in the video said. \u201cYou have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness.\u201dRussia said it took control of several villages elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region and destroyed 11 Ukrainian military targets overnight, including three artillery warehouses. Russian attacks also struck populated areas.Associated Press journalists observed shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city; regional Gov. Oleh Sinehubov said three people were killed.In the Luhansk area of the Donbas, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six people died during the shelling of a village, Gorskoi.In Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas, the AP witnessed two soldiers arriving at a hospital, one of them mortally wounded.Sitting in a wheelchair outside her damaged Sloviansk apartment, Anna Direnskaya, 70, said, \u201cI want peace.\u201dOne of many native Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, Direnskaya said she wishes Russians would understand that Ukrainians are not bad people and that there should be no enmity between them.\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d she said. \u201cI don't know.\u201dBritish officials said Russian forces had not gained significant new ground, but Ukrainian officials announced a nationwide curfew ahead of Easter Sunday, a sign of the war's disruption and threat to the entire country.Mariupol has been a key Russian objective and has taken on outsize importance in the war.It would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014. Russia-backed separatists control parts of the Donbas.An adviser to Ukraine's presidential office, Oleksiy Arestovych, said Russian forces resumed airstrikes on the Azovstal plant and were also trying to storm it, in an apparent reversal of tactics. Two days earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin had given an order not to send troops in but instead to blockade the plant.Ukrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops along with civilians are taking refuge in its tunnels.Earlier Saturday the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the plant, released the video of around two dozen women and children. Its contents could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians trapped underground there.The video shows soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl says she and her relatives \u201chaven't seen neither the sky nor the sun\u201d since they left home Feb. 27.The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told the AP the video was shot Thursday.The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed by far-right activists in 2014 at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and has elicited criticism for some of its tactics.More than 100,000 people \u2014 down from a prewar population of about 430,000 \u2014 are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city.Yet another attempt to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol failed Saturday. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organised buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 227 kilometres to the northwest.\u201cAt 11 o'clock, at least 200 Mariupol residents gathered near the Port City shopping centre, waiting for evacuation,\u201d Andryushchenko posted on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cThe Russian military drove up to the Mariupol residents and ordered them to disperse, because now there will be shelling.\u201dAt the same time, he said, Russian buses assembled about 200 metres (yards) away.Residents who boarded those were told they were being taken to separatist-occupied territory and not allowed to disembark, Andryushchenko said. His account could not be independently verified.In the attack on Odesa, Russian troops fired at least six missiles, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister.\u201cResidents of the city heard explosions in different areas,\u201d Gerashchenko said via Telegram.\u201cResidential buildings were hit. It is already known about one victim. He burned in his car in a courtyard of one of the buildings.\u201dZelenskyy's news conference was held in a Kyiv subway station, where he paused at one point as a train noisily passed through.The subway system, which includes the world's deepest station, attracted widespread attention early in the war when hordes of people took shelter there.Regarding the expected visit Sunday by US officials, Zelenskyy said: \u201cI believe that we will be able to get agreements from the United States or part of that package on arming Ukraine which we agreed on earlier. Besides, we have strategic questions about security guarantees, which it is time to discuss in detail, because the United States will be one of those leaders of security countries for our state.\u201d",

            "text": "Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel became the frontlines of the unprovoked Russian invasion for a month as Putin\u2019s forces attempted to capture the capital city Kyiv.\n\nIrpin was the first of the trio of cities to become free from Russian occupation on March 28. The liberation of Bucha and Hostomel followed on April 1. Also on the same day, Ukrainian Armed Forces regained control over Demidov, Dymer, and Ivankov, towns that had suffered from brutal occupation since the first days of the war. Reports were gathered from numerous sources in Irpin and participants in the counterattack, to create a chronicle of events to document the history of the war and the chapter of Ukraine\u2019s struggle to maintain its independence.\n\nWhen the horror began on February 27\n\nA swarm of Russian helicopters attacked the airfield in Hostomel, home of the Antonov AN-225 airplane, at the beginning of the war. The first fierce battle took place there. On February 27, the first column of Russian armored forces entered Bucha. On the same day, the invading forces took heavy losses for the first time on Vokzalna Street, which was the main transportation route to Irpin. The enemy continued to push for Kyiv, but contrary to the predictions of Russian planners and Western military observers, Russian troops did not reach there in three days or thirty-three. Instead, the Ukrainian Army counterattacked.\n\nThe Russians were stopped on March 8\n\nOn March 8, military experts recorded the last successful attempt by Russian troops to attack on the right flank in the direction of Kyiv. They were moving from the formerly occupied village of Babyntsi in the direction of Kyiv with forces of up to five battalion-tactical groups, but they could not push beyond Bucha. From that moment on, Russian troops lost the ability to advance and began to prepare for defense.\n\nOn March 15, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appointed the head of the military administration in Kyiv region. He selected Oleksandr Pavliuk, former commander of the Ukrainian Peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. Awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine in early March, Zelenskyy appointed him to further strengthen the defense of the capital and Kyiv region.\n\nOn March 17, military experts reported that the Russians had begun digging in across the occupied territories. It was predicted that Russia would try to turn the war into one of attrition, and use its numerical advantage in artillery to destroy Kyiv and its defenders.\n\nOn March 21, the Russians were close to being able to fire not only cruise and ballistic missiles at the center of Kyiv, but also artillery. To accomplish this, however, they needed positions closer than 15 miles.\n\nThe distance was strategically important, because Russian forces had a limited supply of their expensive missiles to used against the capital\u2019s air defense network. Artillery shells, by contrast, are virtually impossible to intercept. They are very cheap and the Russians have huge reserves. It was the use of artillery that brought the greatest destruction to Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, and other cities.\n\nThe first reports of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops surfaced on March 19 and 20. On March 22, Ukrainian Armed Forces expelled the Russians from Makarov, a village near the Zhytomyr highway, and from the village of Moshchun near Pushcha-Vodytsya, along the Irpin River and northeast of the city of Irpin. The Irpin River bank became the main barrier utilized by the defenders of Kyiv.\n\nDue to the demolition of the dam near the village of Demydiv, the water of Irpin River \u2013 which was were previously pumped into the Kyiv Sea \u2013 overflowed and blocked the road for enemy vehicles north of the city of Irpin. The natural obstruction limited possible approaches to the capital to three, or would require the Russians to drive further South. All three bridges across the river on the Zhytomyr, Irpin, and Warsaw routes were blown up in the first days of the war.\n\nOn March 23, the first details of a siege by Russian forces in Bucha and Irpin were reported. Ukrainian troops pushed the Russians to Borodyanka and marched on the outskirts of the Warsaw route. It was along that route that the 40-mile armored convoy traveled, the main supply line for Russian invasion forces in Irpin and Bucha. The Ukrainian military was able to attack the stalled Russian vehicles at that section of the road, and destroy the rear of the Russian army near Kyiv.\n\nThere were actually two main roads for resupply at that time. The best was the Warsaw route from Bucha to Borodyanka and further \u2013 the road north to Ivankov, through the Chernobyl zone to Belarus. The second and more problematic was a little east, along the river Irpin and further to Demydiv, Dymer, and Ivankiv.\n\nFighting in the Russian rear in the region was also visible in satellite images. In a service provided by NASA that collects information about fires visible from space, plumes of burning smoke can be seen along the routes that Russian forces received supplies near Kyiv. The destruction was the result of Ukrainian artillery, and frequent ambushes that destroyed logistics at the Russian rear.\n\nThe military operation around Irpin-Bucha lasted for the next three days. According to military expert Tom Cooper, the Armed Forces went on the offensive, \u201cstriking in different places and at different times along the front line to disrupt the supply of Russian troops.\u201d He described the tactic as an effective way to keep Russian artillery beyond 15 miles from Kyiv, which prevented effective strikes at the city\u2019s center.\n\nOn March 26, it was reported that the Russian military had appointed Alexander Chayko of the Eastern Military District as commander of the 35th Separate Army near Chernobyl. He was expected to regroup Russian troops and lead them into battle. But on the March 28 there was an official announcement about the liberation of Irpin. On April 1, reports confirmed that the Russian army had left the Chernobyl zone.\n\nLiberating cities is harder than defending\n\nThe operation to liberate Irpin began two weeks after the destruction of the Russian rear by the Ukrainian Army. Ukraine Forces recaptured street after street in close combat.\n\nMilitary experts have described urban defense as a hell for any soldier. Defenders always have the advantage. They choose where to fight, and can hold back the dominant forces of the enemy. This tactic gave Ukrainians the advantage at the start of the invasion. However, once Russians captured an area the same tactic made it harder for Ukrainian troops to push them out. But Irpin was an example of Ukraine\u2019s determination, and set the stage for the liberation of the rest of Ukraine.\n\nA member of the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps (DUK), Danya Dansky, offered details of the operation. He participated against Russian hostilities in 2014, including the battles for Donetsk Airport. Before the war, Dansky worked in production of furniture. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, he began military training to defend his homeland. When Putin launched his unprovoked war to seize all of Ukraine, Dansky again volunteered.\n\nOn March 20, his unit arrived in Irpin with the task of liberating the city from enemy forces. At that time, the Ukrainian military controlled the central part of the city and the bridge to Bucha near the Giraffe Mall on Soborna Street, the central street that runs through the entire city and connects Kyiv to Bucha.\n\nOn the eastern and western outskirts of the city, and on both sides at the center, were Russian troops. But they failed to completely occupy the city. Russian troops were based in a triangle in the west of the city and in the northeast.\n\nOne of the final battles took place at the intersection of Hostomel Highway, Vulytsya Severynivs Road, and 10th Street. The Pchelka store at the crossroads was the main landmark.\n\nDansky commanded reconnaissance and cover for his tank unit. The task of his team was to find the enemy, assess its strength, help coordinate an armored attack, and protect the tank in battle. Despite considerable armor and firepower, tanks are vulnerable to anti-tank missiles and grenade launchers. The inability of the Russians to apply basic military tactics left much of their armor without infantry support. The result was that Ukrainian forces were highly effective in the destruction of Russian tanks.\n\nHow the liberation of Irpin took place\n\nAfter arriving in Irpin, Dansky\u2019s platoon began to advance along with a collection of other units. Each day, step by step, they moved forward until the city was completely liberated. In his eight years of fighting, Dansky said he had never encountered such intense artillery fire from the enemy.\n\n\u201cThe Russians got stuck in the buildings. They shot or burned our equipment. But the main problem was that they beat us very hard with artillery, mines, grenades, everything. \u201cIn the first 4 hours when we arrived, they fired 260 shells. We counted. Our artillery could not fire so actively at the Russians, because there were civilians everywhere. The Russian military was not worried at all about civilian casualties or destruction. We had to fight against enemy infantry and also against their armored vehicles. The enemy used tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and even light self-propelled guns in Irpin.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nThe heaviest final battles took place in the area of Hostomel Highway and the military hospital on the northern outskirts of the city. At that time the Russian occupation of Irpin was coming to an end.\n\n\u201cAt the crossroads we met enemy infantry, when they saw our tanks gathered in one place. They were about 54 yards away and started running away after we opened up on them. The Russians left behind many weapons and equipment that will now work against them. And they also left evidence of their robberies. In places where there should be infantry gear used for fighting, we found many stolen things. They were purely looters, taking things to sell back home.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nElite Russian forces in Irpin\n\nThe city was occupied by elite units of the Russian army. Soldiers of the 106th and 98th Airborne Divisions, the 76th and 31st Airborne Assault Divisions, and the Black Sea Fleet Marines were spotted there. These troops are the best trained and equipped units of the Russian army. It was their job to quickly capture the suburbs of Kyiv and storm the capital. But the Ukrainian people stopped their invasion and forced them to retreat.\n\n\u201cWe saw these so-called elite troops flee very quickly. After we came in and advanced on their positions, they immediately ran away. They did not want to die, they were afraid. We were ready to stand to the end, because this is our land,. It will be liberated. Everything will be liberated, both Crimea and Donbas.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nMurders of citizens and destruction of buildings\n\nMost Irpin residents were evacuated in late February and early March. But from the first days of spring, it became dangerous to leave the city alone, outside the humanitarian corridors. During the month of March, while the fighting continued, locals were evacuated in groups over a pedestrian crossing under the destroyed bridge to Romanivka. The efforts took place under fire and at risk of death. After the destruction of the railways, it was the only way to leave Irpin, all other areas were shelled and controlled by the enemy.\n\nBut several thousand people remained in the city during that time, in all areas including the occupied ones. For a month they lived almost without communication, without electricity, no gas, no water, and no heat. They practically did not leave their basements, because they risked their lives to go outside and look for supplies. But many did go out, and became victims of Russian war crimes. Many eyewitness accounts from surviving residents have been collected, about shootings and rapes by Russians. Ukrainian soldiers also saw evidence of those crimes when they entered the city, along with hundreds of boobytraps left behind.\n\nSome of the residents who remained in the city could not leave their sick relatives, some simply decided that it was safer to stay at home. Among them were the elderly. At the same time, the locals helped Ukrainian soldiers, and showed them the safe ways navigate around Irpin.\n\nOnly a few days after the city\u2019s liberation did local authorities and police have the opportunity to pick up and bury the dead. But it was a slow process because occupation forces had left numerous mines, particularly on bodies.\n\nMost of the houses in the city were damaged or destroyed. According to Irpin\u2019s Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, who headed the Irpin Territorial Defense and was in the city all the time helping the townspeople, the western suburbs, the Synergy district with new buildings, and the BKZ district bordering Bucha, all suffered the most damage. The new building in the area of Hostomel Highway were severely damaged from the fighting. Thousands of private estates in all parts of the city were looted and destroyed, along with schools and businesses.\n\nIrpin has started the slow process of cleaning up after war and is in the process of coming back to life. Despite all the attempts by Russian forces to wipe out the town, it remained defiant and victorious. Irpin was awarded the title of \u201cHero City\u201d for stopping the Russian advance, and for its sacrifice. All the artillery shells, rockets, and bombs that fell on Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel could fall on Kyiv.",

However, the European community which is already mobilizing cutting-edge equipment for Ukraine is unconvinced.\n\nUnder pressure, Germany had to pull the plug on the Nord Stream II pipeline but it now seems to be drawing a line.\n\nCriticism of Berlin has grown tremendously after it was revealed that German companies had used a loophole in an EU embargo on arms exports to Russia, selling \u201cdual-use\u201d equipment to Moscow for \u20ac121 million ($130.1 million), including guns and special protection vehicles.\n\nUkrainian ambassador to Germany accused Berlin of arming Russia while refusing to send military equipment to Ukraine. In 2020 alone Germany sold \u20ac366 million of dual use goods to Russia. These can be used for military purposes. German policy in the Ukraine crisis is shameful. \u2014 Alan Sked (@profsked) February 13, 2022\n\nInterestingly, Germany had earlier taken advantage of the loopholes in the EU embargo regime against China to supply MTU engines for its submarines. It was not too long ago that it clarified that it was not doing any business with China anymore, as previously observed by the EurAsian Times.\n\nBerlin justified its use of an ambiguity in the EU\u2019s 2014 arms embargo, saying that the products were only delivered after the Kremlin promised they would be used for civilian purposes rather than military ones.\n\nOn the other hand, as part of 76 export licenses, France was also determined to be liable for shipments worth \u20ac152 million ($164.4 million) to Russia. Using a loophole in the EU embargo, Paris permitted exporters to complete contracts signed before 2014.\n\nAlong with bombs, rockets, and torpedoes, French companies delivered thermal imaging cameras, as well as navigation systems for fighter aircraft, attack helicopters and Russian tanks.\n\nSince the Russian invasion began on February 24, the EU has imposed additional limitations on dual-use item exports to Moscow, effectively shutting the loophole. However, the exemption on previously agreed-upon weaponry sales to Russia was not revoked until the bloc\u2019s fifth package of sanctions.\n\nWhen it became clear that weapons were still flowing into Russia, envoys from Poland and Lithuania worked to alter the original 2014 arms embargo language earlier this month.\n\nAccording to data from the European Commission, EU members sold Russia \u20ac39 million ($35.7 million) in weaponry and ammunition last year as the Kremlin prepared for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCountries often cite the \u201cGrandfather Clause\u201d to evade the embargos set by organizations, something that France has chosen as an escape from this situation. A grandfather clause is a provision that allows an old rule to apply to some current instances while a new rule applies to all future cases.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that France goes to the second round of polling soon and these revelations might have some impact on the voting patterns across the French population.\n\nNATO Divided Over Russia?\n\nEven though NATO countries have unanimously condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Russia\u2019s use of brute force and war crimes, there is no perfect agreement among the allies on the extent of sanctions that should be imposed on Russia.\n\nSome countries like Hungary have openly stated that they would not support more sanctions on Russia that would dent its own economy.\n\nFurther, even as the US, the UK, Canada and Australia have completely banned oil purchases from Russia, several European countries have continued to buy the Russian oil which has led to an uptick in supply. However, this could be expected to be sized down in the coming days.\n\nThe fact that France and Germany chose to supply arms to Russia despite largely acknowledging the insurgency fueled by Russia in the Donbas region is telling of Moscow\u2019s role in international integration, trade and defense relationships. However, these same weapons would now be used by the Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nTobias Ellwood, the chairman of the Commons defense committee, believes that at the June NATO meeting in Madrid, all member states should announce that they will not be transferring armaments to Russia.\n\n\u201cIf we agree Russia now presents an existential threat to European security, then there is no excuse for any European country to continue supplying Russia arms,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Russian assault in the Donbas region has intensified manifold in the last few days as it prepares to seize the region from Ukraine. Even as military aid keeps pouring from some NATO states, there is a challenge for the allies to put their own house in order and ensure consensus to avoid public embarrassment and Ukraine\u2019s ire.",

Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 over 2.9 million people have entered Poland from Ukraine -- a large proportion of the over 5 million who\u2019ve left the country.\n\nUkraine Continues to Repel Russia Along Line of Contact (7:30 a.m.)\n\nRussia has made some territorial gains, likely at \u201csignificant cost\u201d to its troops, but numerous assaults along the line of contact in the Donbas this week have been repelled, the U.K. said in an intelligence update.\n\n\u201cPoor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,\u201d the U.K. said.\n\nRussia continues to attack the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, including with strikes from long-range aircraft. Satellite images in towns near Mariupol show what appear to be mass graves; city officials have estimated 10,000 or more may have died during the week\u2019s long siege.\n\nGermany to Borrow Extra 40 Billion Euros to Cushion War Blow (11:41 p.m.)\n\nGermany will increase its borrowing plans this year to cushion the effect of the war in Ukraine, taking the total for net new debt to almost 140 billion euros, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe adjustment is needed to help finance measures to offset the economic impact of the war and surging energy prices on companies and consumers, said the people. The plan will be presented to the cabinet on Wednesday, and then onto parliament for approval.\n\nZelenskiy Says Austin, Blinken Will Visit (6:40 p.m.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be discussing the list of weapons we need and the pace of their delivery to Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskiy said at a press conference in a Kyiv subway station. \u201cI will emphasize again -- the last week, the signals, the messages, the tone on weapon supplies -- everything has improved.\u201d Ukraine is waiting for the security situation to allow the U.S. president to visit, he said.\n\nThe U.S. National Security Council and the State Department did not immediately comment. The visits, if confirmed, would be the first by top American officials to Ukraine\u2019s capital since the war began.\n\nZelenskiy Says Weapons Flow May Bolster Counteroffensive (6:40 p.m.)\n\nZelenskiy also said accelerated weapon supplies from the U.S. and European nations may enable Ukraine\u2019s military to step its counteroffensive. \u201cParticularly, we see a change in the speed of response from the U.S., and if this speed increases, we\u2019ll be able to speed up de-occupation of our territory.\u201d\n\nThe president said Ukraine\u2019s military isn\u2019t in a position to relieve forces and citizens trapped in the Azovstal factory in Mariupol, which is encircled by Russian forces.\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "text": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces called in airstrikes on a besieged steel factory in the southern city of Mariupol to try to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops holding out in the strategic port, Ukrainian officials said Sunday, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would meet in Kyiv with two top American officials.Zelenskyy gave few details about the logistics of his planned talks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on what was the 60th day since Russia invaded Ukraine. But he told reporters he expected the Americans to come bringing \"not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons.\"The visit would be the first to Ukraine's capital by high-level U.S. officials since the invasion began Feb. 24. While visiting Poland in March, Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil to meet with the country's foreign minister. Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a U.S. leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris.The meeting was set to take place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter, an occasion Zelenskyy highlighted the allegorical significance of to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\"The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!\" he said, speaking Sunday from the ancient St. Sophia Cathedral.Russia has been trying to take Mariupol for nearly two months, and the city on the Sea of Azov has seen some of the war's worst deprivations. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014.Some 2,000 troops have been fighting tenaciously to hold on to the last remaining Ukrainian outpost in the city, the Azovstal steel plant, which also has civilians taking refuge in its labyrinthine tunnel system.Russian forces have continued to pummel the plant, hitting it with air strikes, including by long-range aircraft, Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesman for the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff, said Sunday.Mariupol has been blockaded for most of the war. Ukrainian officials have said they expect to find thousands of dead civilians and evidence of war crimes there when the fighting ends. Satellite images have shown what appear to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol.In the last day, Russia also pressed its attacks elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war and the Russians are aiming to gain full control over Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland.Shtupun said Russian forces intensified their assault operations toward the cities of Popasna and Siverodonetsk in Luhansk, and Kurakhiv in Donetsk. Luhansk regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that eight people were killed and two others were wounded in a Russian barrage on Saturday.The Russians also have shelled the Dnipro region west of Donbas, where at least one person was killed by a Russian missile, according to regional Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko.Russia has pulled back forces from Kyiv, and the north of the country to feed into the Donbas offensive, but the British Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week.\"Despite Russia making some territorial gains, Ukrainian resistance has been strong across all axes and inflicted significant cost on Russian forces,\" the ministry said in an intelligence update.\"Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,\" it said.In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. A 3-month-old baby was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, officials said. Zelenskyy said 18 more were wounded.\"The war started when this baby was one month old. Can you imagine what is happening?\" Zelenskyy said. \"They are just bastards. ... I don't have any other words for it, just bastards.\"The Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.The command post was hit on Friday, killing two generals and critically wounding another, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency said in a statement. The Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.If true, at least nine Russian generals have been killed since the start of the invasion, according to Ukrainian reports.On Saturday the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the Mariupol steel plant, released a video of around two dozen women and children sheltering there. Its contents could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians trapped underground there.The video shows soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl said she and her relatives had \"seen neither the sky nor the sun\" since they left home Feb. 27.The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told the AP the video was shot Thursday. The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed by far-right activists in 2014 at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and has elicited criticism for some of its tactics.More than 100,000 people - down from a prewar population of about 430,000 - are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city.Yet another attempt to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol failed Saturday. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organized buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 141 miles to the northwest.",

(Jack Guez/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nNATO, Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at \u2018Cold War\u2019 Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said \u201cUkraine has changed things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Americans are back. This hasn\u2019t been the case since the Cold War,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area\u201d in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe said.\n\nCurrently, there are about 20 Russian warships positioned around the Mediterranean, Lavernhe told the AFP news agency. Meanwhile, the United States has doubled its naval presence in the region since the start of the Ukraine war, the official said.\n\n\u201cWhere there are American forces, the Russians are there too,\u201d Lavernhe said. \u201cRussian ships are positioned to monitor the activity of allied forces.\u201d\n\nNATO operated about three aircraft carrier strike groups in the region before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The United States several weeks ago extended the deployment of the USS Truman aircraft carrier strike group in the eastern portion of the Mediterranean.\n\nA man rides a motorbike past a destroyed Russian tank on a road in the village of Rusaniv, near Kyiv, Ukraine, on April 16, 2022. (Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe role of Truman, with other allies, is to deter Russians from further aggression and to be on constant standby for orders that might be given from our president or from other leaders around the world for the protection of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine,\u201d U.S. Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro told reporters last month.\n\nIt comes as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin were visiting Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, on April 24 to discuss sending more powerful weapons to Ukraine\u2019s military.\n\nThe trip was announced by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on April 23, although the State Department and Pentagon haven\u2019t issued public comments on the matter.\n\nThe United States and its NATO allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. The UK has promised to send military vehicles and said it was considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\u2019s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces are attempting to storm the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol by land, backed up by aerial and artillery bombardment, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on April 24.\n\n\u201cRussian troops are trying to finish off the defenders of Azovstal and more than 1,000 civilians who are hiding at the plant,\u201d Arestovych wrote on Facebook. He said on April 23 that troops in the steel complex were attempting counterattacks.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.",

Click here for updates from April 22.\n\nRussia Destroys US and EU Weapons Delivered to Ukraine, Moscow Says\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said it used high-precision missiles on Saturday to destroy a logistics terminal in the Black Sea port city of Odesa where a large number of weapons supplied by the United States and European nations were being stored.\n\nIt also said Russian forces had killed up to 200 Ukrainian troops and destroyed more than 30 vehicles on Saturday.\n\nIn Odesa, at least eight people were killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings, and two more were destroyed on Saturday, the Ukrainian armed forces said.\n\nThe death toll could not be independently verified. The last big strike on or near Odesa was in early April.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin to Visit Kyiv and Hold Talks with Zelenskyy\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said Saturday.\n\nThe U.S. top diplomat and Pentagon chief will hold talks with Zelenskyy and discuss what kinds of weapons are to be provided to Ukraine to confront the Russian offensive, the Ukrainian leader said during a press conference.\n\nThe visit was announced after President Joe Biden add an extra $800 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nRussia Investigates Media Report on Presence of British SAS Special Forces in Ukraine\n\nRussia\u2019s top state investigative body said on Saturday it was looking into a Russian media report alleging that sabotage experts from Britain\u2019s Special Air Service (SAS) have been deployed to western Ukraine.\n\nThe SAS is an elite military force trained to conduct special operations, surveillance, and counter-terrorism. Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti news agency on Saturday quoted a Russian security source as saying about 20 SAS members had been sent to the Lviv region.\n\nIn a statement, the Investigative Committee said it would follow up on the report that they had been sent in \u201cto assist the Ukrainian special services in organizing sabotage on the territory of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe British Ministry of Defense had no immediate comment on the Russian investigation in response to a Reuters request.\n\nBritain said it sent military trainers to Ukraine earlier this year to instruct local forces in using anti-tank weapons but the British government said on Feb. 17\u2014a week before Russia\u2019s invasion\u2014that it had pulled out all troops except those needed to protect its ambassador.\n\nIt was not clear what steps the Investigative Committee planned to take in response to any SAS involvement in Ukraine. But the investigation into the possible presence of forces from a NATO country is significant, given that Russia has issued warnings to the West not to get in the way of its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine.\n\n___\n\nRussian Space Chief Warns of Possible Trigger for World War III\n\nAn attack against a spacecraft could usher in the next global war, Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia\u2019s national space agency Roscosmos, said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cOne must keep in mind that the destruction of a foreign spacecraft means World War III. It\u2019s a casus belli, and there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Rogozin said, using a Latin term for a formal legal reason to start a war.\n\nRogozin was commenting on Washington\u2019s decision to stop conducting anti-satellite missile tests. Announcing the move on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris called the destruction of satellites during such tests \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d because it leaves dangerous space debris.\n\nThe Roscosmos chief, however, argued that the United States is now \u201cpretending to be doves\u201d because it had already conducted all the necessary tests. \u201cThis move should, therefore, be strictly viewed as propaganda,\u201d he said.\n\nRogozin argued that the Boeing X-37, an unmanned U.S. shuttle-like spacecraft currently orbiting the Earth, could potentially be used for spying and carrying weapons of mass destruction. He said that a proposal by Russia and China to sign a treaty banning the placement of weapons in outer space was met with \u201cdead silence\u201d in Washington.\n\nThe stationing of weapons of mass destruction in outer space has been internationally banned since 1967.\n\n____\n\nGeneral Accuses Boris Johnson of Disclosing Military Secrets\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is \u201ctempting evil\u201d with his statements about the training of Ukrainian troops abroad amid the conflict with Russia, Polish General Waldemar Skrzypczak, who advises the defense minister, said on Friday.\n\nDuring a visit to India earlier this week, Johnson told journalists that \u201cwe are currently training Ukrainians in Poland in the use of anti-aircraft defense, and actually in the UK in the use of armored vehicles.\u201d\n\nSkrzypczak, who headed one of the multinational divisions in Iraq in the mid-2000s, told Polish newspaper Fakt that \u201cwhen we were on missions abroad it was hard to imagine that one of the politicians would talk about our plans or training on television.\u201d\n\nBy making the comments, Johnson \u201creveals military secrets\u201d to Russia, the general said. \u201cTraining is a military matter and must be kept under wraps. The man should \u2026 think before saying such things.\u201d\n\nThe former commander of Poland\u2019s land forces called the prime minister\u2019s behavior \u201cextremely irresponsible,\u201d warning that it could lead to \u201cdisastrous consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prime minister may not be aware of this, but with such statements he endangers the success of the entire military operation, as well as the safety of soldiers,\u201d Skrzypczak said.\n\n_____\n\nRussia to Deploy Sarmat Missiles by Autumn in \u2018Historic\u2019 Nuclear Upgrade\n\nRussia said on Saturday it plans to deploy its newly tested Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles by autumn.\n\nThe target stated by Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, is an ambitious one as Russia reported its first test-launch only on Wednesday and Western military experts say more will be needed before the missile can be deployed.\n\nThe Sarmat is capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads and decoys, and of striking targets thousands of miles away in the United States or Europe.\n\nThis week\u2019s test, after years of delays due to funding and technical issues, marks a show of strength by Russia at a time when the war in Ukraine has sent tensions with the United States and its allies soaring to their highest levels since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.\n\nRogozin said in an interview with Russian state TV that the missiles would be deployed with a unit in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, about 3,000 km (1,860 miles) east of Moscow.\n\nHe said they would be placed at the same sites and in the same silos as the Soviet-era Voyevoda missiles they are replacing, something that would save \u201ccolossal resources and time.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the \u201csuper-weapon\u201d was a historic event that would guarantee the security of Russia\u2019s children and grandchildren for the next 30 to 40 years, Rogozin added.\n\nWestern concern about the risk of nuclear war has increased since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 with a speech in which he pointedly referred to Moscow\u2019s nuclear forces and warned that any attempt to get in Russia\u2019s way \u201cwill lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJapan, Russia Reach Agreement on Fishing Quotas Amid Ukraine-Related Sanctions\n\nJapan and Russia have reached an agreement on Tokyo\u2019s fishing quotas for salmon and trout spawned in Russian rivers, despite Moscow\u2019s anger over the spate of economic sanctions that Tokyo imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nJapan\u2019s Fisheries Agency said Saturday that the two countries agreed on Tokyo\u2019s fishing quota of 2,050 tons of salmon and trout within its exclusive economic zone, with the agreement expected to be signed next week, Kyodo News reported.\n\nUnder the agreement, Japan will pay an annual cooperation fee of between 200 million yen ($1.56 million) and 300 million yen ($2.34 million) to Russia, depending on the eventual tonnage of the catch. A cooperation fee is paid to the country where the fish were spawned.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\nUkraine President Spoke With UK\u2019s Johnson About \u2018New Phase\u2019 of Military Aid\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson about a \u201cnew phase\u201d of military aid, including the provision of heavy weapons, the president\u2019s deputy chief of staff Andriy Sybiga said on Saturday.\n\nSpeaking on national television, Sybiga said the pair also talked about further financial support for Ukraine on the call.\n\n____\n\nZelenskyy: Allies Finally Delivering Weapons Kyiv Asked For\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday said allies were finally delivering the weapons that Kyiv had asked for, adding the arms would help save the lives of thousands of people.\n\nIn a late-night video address, Zelenskyy also said comments earlier in the day by a Russian commander about the need to link up with Moldova showed Moscow wanted to invade other countries.\n\n_____\n\nUkraine: Missile Attack Kills 5 in Odesa\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president says five people were killed in a missile attack in the Black Sea port city of Odesa.\n\nUkraine presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, provided the information Saturday.\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister earlier said Russian forces fired at least six cruise missiles at the city.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko said in a Telegram post on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were able to shoot down several missiles, but at least one landed and exploded.\n\n____\n\nUS Warns Russia of \u2018Astronomical\u2019 Nuclear Price\n\nRussia would pay an \u201castronomical\u201d price should its President Vladimir Putin order the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, said on Friday amid the ongoing Russian offensive.\n\nIn an interview for the Ukrainian outlet European Pravda, Nuland was asked to assess the possibility of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons. She responded that she could not rule out such a \u201ccatastrophic scenario\u201d as Putin \u201chas already ordered\u201d what, she alleged, were \u201cbrutal war crimes,\u201d and the world must be prepared for the worst. At the same time, Nuland stressed, the consequences of such steps would be catastrophic for Russia and for Putin personally.\n\nShe refused to provide any details about the potential response from the West, saying instead that use of nuclear weapons would take the situation to a \u201cfundamentally new level\u201d where the price will be \u201csimply astronomical.\u201d\n\nAsked by a journalist if Kyiv can rely on its Western partners\u2019 support in a worst-case scenario, Nuland reassured Ukraine that it would not be left alone. Meanwhile, the under secretary of state said, the United States would continue to provide Ukraine with military assistance. She revealed that Washington has begun supplying Kyiv with multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and would do its best to keep up with Ukraine\u2019s needs.\n\nNuland\u2019s strongly-worded warnings came just two days after the Pentagon said that at this point it does not see a need to change the country\u2019s nuclear posture. The U.S. Department of Defense spokesman\u2019s statement followed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s claims that Moscow could use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\n_____\n\nPentagon Seeking Info From US Industry on Ukraine-Ready Systems\n\nThe Pentagon is looking for new avenues for U.S. industry to accelerate production and build more capacity for proven, effective weapons that require minimal training and can be rapidly exported to Ukraine, according to a government website posting on Friday.\n\nThe Department of Defense posted a request for information on SAM.gov that had an initial response deadline of May 6 and sought information on weapons or commercial capabilities related to air defense, anti-armor, anti-personnel, coastal defense, counter battery, unmanned aerial systems, and communications like radios or satellite internet.\n\n______\n\nGermany Should Stop Sending Weapons to Ukraine: Public Figures\n\nFurther military aid to Ukraine would only lead to an uncontrollable escalation of hostilities and prolong the suffering of the people caught up in the fighting, a group of German politicians and public figures have warned Chancellor Olaf Scholz in an open letter. By providing arms to Kyiv, Germany and other NATO nations \u201chave de facto made themselves a war party,\u201d the letter published by the Berliner Zeitung on Friday has said.\n\nThe co-authors of the letter, which include the ex-vice president of the Bundestag, Antje Vollmer, and a former U.N. assistant secretary general, Hans-Christof Graf von Sponeck, have said that Ukraine has \u201cbecome the battlefield for the conflict between NATO and Russia over the security order in Europe,\u201d which is now waged \u201cat the expense of the Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\nIf the conflict is not stopped quickly, it will end up in \u201canother big war\u201d similar to Word War I, the letter warns, adding that this time nuclear weapons might be used, bringing \u201cwidespread devastation and the end of human civilization.\u201d Avoiding further destruction and escalation should be an \u201cabsolute priority,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe co-authors, who also include a former German MP, Norman Paech, as well as an ex-director of the Center for Conflict Research in Marburg, Johannes Becker, maintain that NATO\u2019s military support only delays a diplomatic solution, fueling the resistance of the Ukrainian army that \u201chas little chance of winning.\u201d Instead, steps to end the bloodshed must be taken, they argue.\n\n___\n\nRussia Reveals Crew Losses From Sunken Warship\n\nAt least one person was killed and another 27 are missing after the Moskva, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, sunk earlier this month, according to Russian state media.\n\nAnother 396 crew members were evacuated to nearby ships and sent on to Sevastopol, a city in Crimea, Russia\u2019s TASS news agency reported. The Russian government, as of Tuesday, had not previously acknowledged any casualties.\n\nThe Moskva, a guided-missile cruiser, sunk on April 14, though the cause remains disputed.\n\nUkraine says it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles, which sparked a fire that detonated stored ammunition. The Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns, and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had massive amounts of explosives aboard.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry, however, says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ammunition and the resulting explosions left the Moskva with structural damage. It says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port.\n\nPhotos and a short video clip emerged early Monday on social media showing the Moskva badly damaged and on fire in the hours before it sank. The images show the Moskva listing to one side, with black holes from possible missile puncture marks, and significant scarring just above the waterline on the port (left) side in the middle of the vessel. The Kremlin on Monday said it had seen the photos of the Moskva but that they could not verify them.\n\n_____\n\nUkraine: Russians Trying to Storm Steel Mill\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s presidential office says Russian forces are attacking a steel plant that is the last defense stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the strategic port city of Mariupol.\n\nOleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, said during a briefing on Saturday that the Russian forces have resumed airstrikes on Azovstal and were trying to storm it.\n\nArestovich\u2019s statement came two days after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the whole of Mariupol, with the exception of Azovstal, had been \u201cliberated\u201d by the Russians.\n\nPutin ordered the Russian military not to storm the plant and instead to block it off in an apparent attempt to stifle the remaining pocket of resistance there.\n\n____\n\nLviv Announces Curfew Starting Easter Night\n\nLviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy has announced a curfew starting on Orthodox Easter night.\n\nCiting \u201cnew intelligence,\u201d Kozytskyy said the curfew would run from 11 p.m. Saturday to 5 a.m. Sunday, and then every day between those hours until further notice.\n\nKozytskyy said the church leadership is in support of the decision and that all churches in the region will be postponing their Easter night services until the morning hours.\n\n____\n\nCivilian Evacuation Effort Set for Mariupol\n\nEfforts to evacuate civilians to safer areas will continue in Ukraine on Saturday, the country\u2019s officials said.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app there will be another attempt to evacuate women, children, and the elderly from the strategic port city of Mariupol, which has been besieged by Russian forces for weeks.\n\nThe Kremlin earlier this week declared that Mariupol has been \u201cliberated,\u201d with the exception of the Azovstal steel mill, the last pocket of resistance where Ukrainian troops are holed up.\n\nVereshchuk said that \u201cif everything goes according to plan,\u201d the evacuation in Mariupol will begin at midday on Saturday. Many previous attempts to evacuate civilians from the city have failed.\n\nThe governor of the eastern Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on Telegram that an evacuation train will depart Saturday from the eastern city of Pokrovsk. Residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland known as Donbas, will be able to take the train free of charge.\n\nIt will bring them to the Western city of Chop near Ukraine\u2019s border with Slovakia and Hungary, according to Haidai.\n\n_____\n\nUS Convening Talks on Ukraine\u2019s Defense Needs\n\nThe Pentagon says U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will convene a meeting next week in Germany of defense officials and military leaders from more than 20 countries to discuss Ukraine\u2019s immediate and long-term defense needs.\n\nThe Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said Friday that about 40 nations, including NATO members, were invited and that responses are still arriving for the session to be held Tuesday at Ramstein air base. He did not identify the nations that have agreed to attend but said more details will be provided in coming days.\n\nThe meeting comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a major offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe agenda will include an updated assessment of the Ukraine battlefield as well as discussion of efforts to continue a steady flow of weapons and other military aid, Kirby said. It will include consultations on Ukraine\u2019s post-war defense needs but is not expected to consider changes in the U.S. military posture in Europe, he said.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says Ukrainian Fighters \u2018Securely Blockaded\u2019 at Mariupol Steel Plant\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian fighters and foreign mercenaries had been \u201csecurely blockaded\u201d at the Azovstal steel plant where they have been holding out in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin had ordered his defense minister on Thursday to block off the vast Azovstal complex \u201cso not even a fly can get through\u201d rather than try to storm it.\n\nThe defense ministry also said Russia had hit dozens of targets in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions of Ukraine on Friday.\n\n\u201cAll remnants of the Ukrainian \u2018Azov\u2019 Nazis, together with foreign mercenaries from the United States and European countries, are securely blockaded on the territory of the Azovstal plant,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Nazis are ignoring our demands to release the women and children allegedly with them to travel freely in any direction.\u201d\n\nPutin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 with the stated aim of demilitarizing and \u201cdenazifying\u201d the country.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Says Shelling of Eastern Luhansk\u2019s Cities Intensifying\n\nAll the Ukrainian-controlled cities in the eastern region of Luhansk were being shelled by Russian forces on Saturday and the barrage was intensifying, the region\u2019s governor Serhiy Haidai said on television.\n\nHe claimed Ukrainian forces were leaving some settlements there in order to regroup, but that the move did not amount to a critical setback. Russia denies targeting civilian areas.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russian Forces Made No Major Gains in the Last 24 Hours\n\nRussian forces have made no major gains in the last 24 hours despite increased activity, as Ukrainian counterattacks continue to hinder their efforts, British military intelligence claimed on Saturday.\n\nDespite Russia\u2019s claimed conquest of the port city of Mariupol, heavy fighting continues to frustrate Moscow\u2019s attempts to capture the city, impeding their progress in the Donbas region, the Ministry of Defence claimed on Twitter.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the report.\n\n_____\n\nKyiv Accuses Moscow of \u2018Imperialism\u2019 After Russia Flags Interest in South Ukraine\n\nMoscow wants to take full control over southern Ukraine, a Russian general said on Friday, a statement Ukraine said gave the lie to Russia\u2019s previous assertions that it had no territorial ambitions.\n\nRustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district, was quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to Transnistria, a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Minnekayev\u2019s statement showed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was \u201cintended only as a beginning.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry said Russia\u2019s goal of the \u201csecond phase\u201d of the war is \u201csimply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine. Imperialism as it is.\u201d\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Jalina Porter declined specific comment on Minnekayev\u2019s statement but said Washington firmly supported Moldova\u2019s sovereignty and was \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about events on the ground. \u201cNo one should be fooled by the Kremlin\u2019s announcements,\u201d Porter said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment when asked if Russia had expanded the goals of its operation and how Moscow saw the political future of southern Ukraine.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says It Shot Down Ukrainian Fighter Jet in Kharkiv Region\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said on Saturday that its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet and destroyed three MI-8 helicopters at an airfield in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Ukraine regarding the Russian claims.\n\n_____\n\nG20 Cannot Function With Russia at the Table, Canada Claims\n\nThe Group of 20 major economies cannot effectively function as long as Russia remains a member, Canada\u2019s finance minister claimed on Friday after a week of protests against Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington.\n\nDiscord over Russia\u2019s presence at the meetings has been on display all week, with officials from the United States, Canada, Britain, and other Western countries staging walkouts three days in a row whenever Russian officials spoke.\n\nThe G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, who met in Washington on Wednesday, failed to agree on its traditional communique outlining economic policy goals as Russia blocked language condemning its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe IMF steering committee and the World Bank-IMF Development Committee also failed to issue joint statements.\n\n\u201cThe G20 can\u2019t function effectively with Russia at the table,\u201d Chrystia Freeland, Canadian minister of finance who is of Ukrainian descent, told a news conference with Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko in Washington.\n\nThe tensions have called into question the effectiveness of the G20, which includes Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, as well as China, India, Indonesia, and South Africa, which have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict.\n\nThis year\u2019s G20 host country Indonesia is still optimistic that progress can be made on a number of issues despite the tensions, Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cEven with a walk out, we all agree\u201d on the substance of work that needs to be done, Indrawati said.\n\nIndrawati said she is more focused on \u201cgrassroots\u201d technical work underlying issues such as strengthening a G20 common debt framework for poor countries, and creating a new financing mechanism for future pandemic needs, than issuing a communique at the present stage.\n\nWith other G20 finance meetings scheduled for July and October and a leaders summit in November, Indrawati said there was ample time to continue progress.\n\n\u201cIf there is no forum at all, then the world is going to be in a much worse place,\u201d with each country setting policy without regard for others.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says It Plans Full Control of Donbas and Southern Ukraine; Moldova Summons Russian Ambassador\n\nRussia plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine during the second phase of what it calls its special military operation, the deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district said on Friday, reported Russian news agencies.\n\nThe Interfax and TASS news agencies cited him as saying that full control of southern Ukraine would improve Russian access to Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transdniestria, which borders Ukraine.\n\n\u201cControl over the south of Ukraine is another way to Transdniestria, where there is also evidence that the Russian-speaking population is being oppressed,\u201d TASS quoted Minnekayev as saying at a meeting in Russia\u2019s central Sverdlovsk region.\n\nMoldova\u2019s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian ambassador to express \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the remarks.\n\n\u201cThese statements are unfounded and contradict the position of the Russian Federation supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of Moldova,\u201d it said on its website.\n\n\u201cDuring the meeting, it was reiterated that the republic of Moldova \u2026 is a neutral state and this principle must be respected by all international actors, including the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\n____\n\nUkraine: Russian Offensive Continues in East\n\nThe Ukraine military\u2019s general staff says that Russian forces continue their \u201coffensive operations\u201d in eastern Ukraine with the goal of defeating Ukrainian forces, establishing full control over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and securing \u201ca land route between these territories and the occupied Crimea.\u201d\n\nUkrainian forces in the past 24 hours repelled eight Russian attacks in the two regions, destroying nine tanks, 18 armored units and 13 vehicles, a tanker, and three artillery systems, the general staff said on its Facebook page on Saturday morning.\n\nRussian forces continue to partially block and shell Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, and are active in the area of Izyum, the update said.\n\nIn the strategic port city of Mariupol, Russian troops \u201ccontinue to blockade\u201d Ukrainian units in the area of the Azovstal steelworks, the last remaining stronghold, and \u201claunch air strikes on the city, including with the use of long-range aircraft,\u201d the post said, adding that an engineering unit arrived in Mariupol in order to demine the port infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nUN Chief to Meet Putin and Zelenskyy Next Week\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will visit Moscow next week to meet Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin and then head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nGuterres will head to Moscow on Tuesday and meet Putin as well as having a working meeting and lunch with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Eri Kaneko, Guterres\u2019 associate spokesperson, told a news briefing in New York on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe hopes to talk about what can be done to bring peace to Ukraine urgently,\u201d Kaneko said.\n\nHe will meet with Zelenskyy on Thursday, foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and staff at UN agencies to discuss the scaling up of humanitarian assistance efforts, the U.N. spokesperson\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nAldgra Fredly, Allen Zhong, CNN, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Over the past eight weeks, Ukrainians have shown incredible resilience against the Russian invasion. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, over 21,000 Russian soldiers have died since the start of the invasion (Western officials estimate the figure is closer to 15,000). Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have died, and the United States believes that 2,000 to 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers have perished in the war. This is in addition to the 14,000 ethnic Ukrainians and Russians who perished after the first Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Simply put, the war has been catastrophic.\n\nDespite these tremendous losses, the Ukrainians have stood their ground. Ukrainian forces have destroyed thousands of Russian tanks, aircraft, helicopters, and armored vehicles. They also sank the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Simply put, the Ukrainians have stalled Russian advances in the country. Except for Kherson, a city located just north of the Crimean peninsula, the Ukrainians have yet to lose a metropolitan center to the Russians.\n\nBut how long can the Ukrainians hold out?\n\nWhile the international community continues to aid Ukraine, the Ukrainians desperately need military assistance. The Ukrainian army and its volunteer battalions need bulletproof vests, helmets, boots, and ammunition. The country has also called for medical assistance so that hospitals can tend to injured combatants and civilians. Finally, Ukraine is in urgent need of funding; the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine have already surpassed $100 billion. A food crisis is also possible.\n\nGiven the devastation caused by the war, Ukraine\u2019s borders must remain open. Numerous forms of humanitarian, medical, and military aid have arrived in Ukraine by way of Poland. Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, has become a major hub for this effort.\n\nIf the international community continues to provide aid to Ukraine, then the Ukrainians can win the war. According to reports, Russia executed its invasion incredibly poorly, with casualties now mounting and much of its equipment destroyed. The losses are leading to a major decline in Russian morale.\n\nMeanwhile, half a million Ukrainians have returned to Ukraine to protect their homeland, and countless foreign fighters have traveled to Ukraine to help defend the country. Overall, Ukrainian morale is high. The Ukrainian military\u2019s persistence could force the Russians from the country, reminiscent of the Finns defeating the Soviets in the 1939-1940 war. Ukraine\u2019s resilience, economic sanctions, and the continued loss of Russian life could be enough to stop the Russian invasion.\n\nThe Russian incursion is also behind schedule. According to reports provided by the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, the Russian General Staff is dissatisfied with the progress of the invasion. Russian officials assumed they would capture Kyiv within four days, and the country within fifteen. Neither occurred.\n\nGiven the failed conquest in northern Ukraine and Russia\u2019s inability to penetrate Ukrainian forces near Kyiv, the Russians have now resorted to a two-front war. In the south, Russian forces are moving through the Crimean peninsula. They established naval superiority, captured the city of Kherson, and launched an offensive in Mariupol. In the east, the Russians entered the country through the controlled territories in Luhansk and Donetsk. The Russians have attempted to capture the major cities in the east, such as Kharkiv and Kramatorsk, but Ukrainian forces have kept them at bay. As a result, the Russians have resorted to shelling these cities, leading to the deaths of thousands of civilians.\n\nWhile Ukraine has stood its ground, new problems could emerge. The Russians have now recruited volunteers from Chechnya and Syria, and Russian president Vladimir Putin is also trying to coerce Belarusian president Alyaksandr Lukashenko to join the fight. Belarusian involvement could be catastrophic for Ukraine, as the distance from the Belarusian-Ukrainian border to Kyiv is only 140 miles. If the Belarusians were to invade northern Ukraine, this could turn the tide in Russia\u2019s favor. The Ukrainians have done well in holding the Russians at bay, but fighting against two armies would be an incredible challenge.\n\nIf Belarusian forces were to enter the war, they could try to disrupt the humanitarian corridor in western Ukraine. Belarusian forces would look to position themselves near the Polish-Ukrainian border. This would stretch the Ukrainian military and its volunteer battalions by forcing them to fight on another front. A new front for Ukraine would allow the Russians to make further advances in southern and eastern Ukraine. Understanding that the corridor with Poland is essential to Ukraine\u2019s survival, Ukrainian forces would need to combat the Belarusians so that the Ukrainians could receive humanitarian, medical, and defense aid from the international community. In other words, if the Belarusians establish a presence near the Polish-Ukrainian border, this would cut off aid to Ukraine.\n\nTherefore, the corridor to Ukraine must remain open, and the international community should continue to arm Ukraine. If Syrian and Chechen mercenaries join the fight, and if the Belarusians cut off the international community\u2019s supply chain to western Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s chances of winning the war will be significantly diminished. However, swiftly providing Ukraine with the lethal and nonlethal aid it needs will help it win the war. Time is of the essence.\n\nMark Temnycky is an accredited freelance journalist covering Eastern Europe and a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nImage: Reuters",

It said Russia had \"acknowledged that the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, Russia's Central Military District said it planned to seize Ukraine's south as part of the \"second phase\" of its military operation.\n\nOver 369,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Germany\n\nAt least 369,000 people fleeing the war have registered in Germany since Russia invaded on February 24, Germany's Interior Ministry said on Friday.\n\nThe precise number to register is 369,381, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed, adding that the actual number is probably much higher.\n\nUN says humanitarian law 'tossed aside,' documents 50 civilians killed in Bucha\n\nThe United Nations said Friday that 50 civilians had been killed in Bucha, some of whom by summary execution.\n\nA UN mission to the Kyiv suburb documented the killings.\n\n\"During a mission to Bucha on the ninth of April, UN human rights officers documented the unlawful killing including by summary execution of some 50 civilians there,\" said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for Michelle Bachelet, UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nBachelet, meanwhile, said on Friday that since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 \"international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored but seemingly tossed aside.\"\n\nThe UN says, in total, it has received more than 300 allegations of civilians being killed in the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, all under the control of Russian armed forces in late February and early March.\n\nAccording to the Geneva Convention, the killing of persons \"taking no active part in hostilities\" constitutes a war crime.\n\nWatch video 00:36 UN official in Ukraine: 'Mariupol is an unfolding tragedy.'\n\nAustralia adds Putin daughters to sanctions lists\n\nAustralia has imposed sanctions and travel bans on two daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has also been targeted, the Australian government said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe statement did not name the two relations of Putin but the president is known to have two adult daughters, Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova.\n\nThe fresh round of sanctions also targets 144 Russian senators.\n\nForeign Minister Marisa Payne added that Canberra will continue to increase the pressure on Moscow by targeting those who bear responsibility for the \"unjustified and unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.\"\n\nWatch video 02:19 Ukrainians' day-to-day lives of suffering\n\nRussian military aims for 'full control' of southern Ukraine, route to Trans-Dniester\n\nMoscow is planning to seize Ukraine's south and open a route to Moldova's Trans-Dniester region, as part of the \"second phase\" of its military operation, Russia's Central Military District (CFD) command said.\n\nIn a statement carried by TASS and Interfax, Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of the CFD, said Russia plans to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine, allowing it access to Trans-Dniester.\n\n\"Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Trans-Dniester,\" Minnekayev said. He then claimed there was evidence of \"oppression\" of the Russian-speaking population there.\n\nRussia had previously used claims of oppression of Russian minorities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine as grounds for military action.\n\nA pro-Russian regime has de facto ruled the breakaway republic of Trans-Dniester since the 1990s, with support from Russian troops.\n\nKyiv has previously warned that Russia may use the region to launch attacks into western Ukraine, potentially surrounding Ukrainian forces in the south of the country, especially around the Odesa region.\n\nMariupol mayor pleads for evacuations but top official says routes too dangerous\n\nThe mayor of Mariupol has pleaded for the \"full evacuation\" of the southern city, but Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said there \"will be no humanitarian corridors\" in the country on Friday.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said \"about 100,000 people remain\" in the city, which President Vladimir Putin says is now controlled by Russian forces, a claim Ukraine denies.\n\nHowever, Deputy PM Vereshchuk said it would be too dangerous for civilians to leave on Friday.\n\n\"Because of the insecurity along the routes, there will be no humanitarian corridors today, April 22,\" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nWatch video 03:40 Russia claims victory in Mariupol\n\nUK: Russia wants to free up troops by not storming Mariupol steel plant\n\nIn an intelligence update on the Ukraine conflict, the UK suggested \"Putin's decision to blockade the Azovstal steel plant likely indicates a desire to contain Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol and free up Russian forces to be deployed elsewhere in eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin previously said it was unnecessary to storm the industrial zone containing the plant.\n\n\"A full ground assault by Russia on the plant would likely incur significant Russian casualties, further decreasing their overall combat effectiveness,\" the UK Ministry of Defense posted on Twitter.\n\nThe statement also said that despite Russia's \"renewed focus they are still suffering from losses sustained earlier in the conflict. In order to try and reconstitute their depleted forces, they have resorted to transiting inoperable equipment back to Russia for repair.\"\n\nHeavy shelling is continuing in the Donbas region as Russia seeks to advance towards settlements, including Krasnyy Lyman, Buhayikva, Barvinkove, Lyman and Popasna, the ministry said in its regular bulletin.\n\nZelenskyy: Russia planning independence 'referendum' in Ukraine's south\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of planning to \"falsify\" a \"referendum\" in parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions that are under Russian control. The regions are located to the north of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nZelenskyy urged residents in these areas not to provide their passport numbers or other personal information to Russian forces.\n\n\"This is not to help you ... This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nMoscow has either orchestrated or supported several similar votes in contested areas of Ukraine in recent years, holding a referendum in Crimea after occupying the territory in 2014 and later supporting independence votes held by pro-Russian separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nLuhansk and Donetsk later declared themselves independent \"people's republics,\" a status soon supported by Russia. The two regions are officially recognized as Ukrainian territory by almost every country in the world, despite being under control of the separatists since 2014.\n\n\"Any 'Kherson People's Republics' are not going to fly,\" Zelenskyy said, alluding to the entities established by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\n\"If someone wants a new annexation, it can only lead to new powerful sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nWatch video 26:00 Can the West ever deal again with Putin?\n\nUkraine's Zelenskyy: Mariupol 'continues to resist'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Mariupol \"continues to resist\" despite Moscow's claim to have captured it.\n\n\"In the south and east of our country, the occupiers continue to do everything to have a reason to talk about at least some victories,\" he said in a video address.\n\n\"They can only delay the inevitable \u2014 the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory, in particular Mariupol, a city that continues to resist Russia, despite everything the occupiers say.\"\n\nUN refugee agency: Situation around the world worsening amid Ukraine war\n\nThe UN High Commission for Refugees (UNCHR) said on Friday that the situation of refugees has further worsened due to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"The conflict has further worsened the situation of many of the approximately 84 million displaced people on earth, as food has already become scarcer and significantly more expensive worldwide,\" the acting UNHCR office manager in Germany, Roland Bank, said in remarks published by Germany's Funke Media Group.\n\nBank added that millions of people had already lost their incomes due to the pandemic. Soaring food and fuel prices pose new challenges for humanitarian groups, Bank said.\n\nWatch video 03:35 An estimated 20.000 have died in Mariupol over the last few weeks: DW's Mathias B\u00f6linger\n\nGermany to provide \u20ac37 million to Ukraine\n\nGerman Development Minister Svenja Shulze on Friday told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper that Berlin would allocate funds for reconstruction in Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine urgently needs housing for millions of internally displaced people and it needs an intact power grid. This is where German development cooperation can help in the short term,\" Shulze told Augsburger Allgemeine. \"My ministry has reallocated funds for this via an emergency program.\"\n\nGermany will provide \u20ac37 million (\u20ac40.1 million) for reconstruction in Ukraine, the paper went on to say citing ministry sources.\n\nAround \u20ac22.5 million would go to the reconstruction of Ukraine's power grid, while the remainder would go to the rebuilding of apartments as well as for the acquisition of medical equipment.\n\nWatch video 03:50 US public broadly supports military help for Ukraine: DW's Sumi Somaskanda\n\nZelenskyy: Russia turned down Easter truce offer\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia rejected a proposal for a cease-fire over the Orthodox Christian Easter period.\n\n\"This very well demonstrates how the leaders of this state actually treat the Christian faith, one of the most joyful and important holidays,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"But we keep the hope. Hope for peace, hope that life beats death,\" he added.\n\nZelenskyy's remarks came after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had appealed for a cease-fire during Easter.\n\nUkraine's Orthodox majority celebrate the holiday this weekend, with the Easter service starting late on Saturday into Sunday morning. Eastern Orthodoxy is also Russia's largest religious denomination.\n\nRussia takes 42 villages in Donetsk region \u2014 Ukrainian presidential aid\n\nUkrainian presidential aid Olena Symonenko said that Russian forces had captured 42 villages in the eastern Donetsk region on Thursday, as Moscow continues to gain ground in Ukraine's east.\n\nSymonenko said that Ukrainian forces could retake the villages on Friday.\n\nThe statements follows Russia's announcement that it had defeated the Ukrainian forces in Mariupol, also located in the Donetsk region, albeit without clearing out the last holdouts at a steelworks in the city.\n\nSummary of Thursday's events in Russia-Ukraine crisis\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin claimed that the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which holds a significant strategic value to Russia, had been \"liberated\" after nearly two months of siege.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials disputed Moscow's claim that Russia was in control of the city.\n\nHundreds of fighters and civilians were believed to still be inside a huge steel plant in Mariupol, which Putin ordered his forces to blockade \"so that not even a fly\" could escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington said it saw \"no evidence\" that Russia was in control of Mariupol, and announced another $800 million (around \u20ac738 million) in military aid for Ukraine, including heavy artillery.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated calls for Western governments to send more heavy weapons to Ukraine in a plea to Portuguese lawmakers.\n\nIn a separate address, Zelenskyy told a World Bank forum that Ukraine needs $7 billion a month to function amid the devastating \"economic losses\" caused by the Russian invasion.\n\nWorld Bank chief David Malpass estimated physical damage to Ukraine's buildings and infrastructure had reached roughly $60 billion, saying the figure would rise further as the war continues.\n\nYou can revisit our April 21 live updates here.\n\nWatch video 00:18 US President Biden steps up military support for Ukraine\n\njsi,sdi,fb/wmr (AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters)",

It is sad that in these days that are the holiest and most solemn for all Christians, the deadly clamor of arms is louder than the sound of bells announcing the Resurrection.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Switzerland has rejected two requests by Germany to export Swiss ammunition to Ukraine, citing the Alpine nation\u2019s strict neutrality.\n\nThe decision was first reported Sunday by Swiss weekly Sonntagszeitung.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs confirmed that \u201cboth requests from Germany, whether the ammunition received from Switzerland can be passed on to Ukraine, were answered negatively with a reference to Swiss neutrality.\u201d\n\nGermany needs Switzerland\u2019s consent for the arms delivery as part of the original sale contract.

He also challenged Russia to conduct a round of talks to negotiate an exit for the Ukrainian defenders of the plant.\n\nPodolyak tweeted that the Russian military is attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery barrage and is accumulating forces and equipment for an assault.\n\nSviatoslav Palamar, an officer with the Azov Regiment defending the plant, said in a video that on Eastern Sunday the Russians are continuing to shower the plant with bombs and shell it with heavy artillery.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military says Russian forces have continued to press their attacks in the east.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Sunday that the Russians fired on Ukrainian positions along the entire line of contact on the war\u2019s 60th day. It also said the Russian military intensified its offensive and assault operations in the Siverodonetsk, Kurakhiv and Popasna directions.\n\nA regional official in eastern Ukraine says at least eight people have been killed by the Russian shelling.\n\nLuhansk regional Governor Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that two others were wounded by the Russian barrage in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe General Staff added that Russian forces have also continued to pummel the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, hitting it with air strikes, including by long-range aircraft.\n\nThe shelling comes as the Russians are pressing their offensive in a bid to gain full control over Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland called Donbas.\n\nThe Russians have also shelled the Dnipro region west of Donbas, where at least one person was killed by a Russian missile, according to Dnipro regional Governor Valentyn Reznichenko.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian military intelligence agency posted a statement saying the command post was hit on Friday and two generals were killed and one was critically wounded.\n\nOleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in an online interview that 50 senior Russian officers were in the command center when it came under attack.

He said Ukraine has intercepted Russian conversations about \u201chow they are concealing the traces of their crimes.\u201d Satellite images have shown what appear to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nZelenskyy said the Russians set up \u201cfiltration camps\u201d near Mariupol for those trying to leave the city, which has largely been reduced to rubble. He said those who survive these camps are sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East. Many of them, he said, are children.\n\nHe said he spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday about the situation in Mariupol and the general course of the war.\n\nZelenskyy promised to find and punish those responsible for the missile attack on Odesa, which he said killed eight people and wounded 18.\n\nZelenskyy urged Ukrainians to observe a curfew and not attend Orthodox Easter services overnight. The lengthy services traditionally begin late Saturday and run through Sunday morning. \u201cBut starting from 5 a.m. you may go to the church in your city, town or community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSLOVIANSK, Ukraine \u2014 The sound of outgoing artillery and air raid sirens were heard Saturday in Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas that had come under Russian attack the day before.\n\nTwo servicemen were brought to a hospital from a nearby town, but one of them was mortally wounded and could not be saved.\n\nThe Russian strike early Friday had damaged several buildings, including a school.\n\nThe war has brought back painful memories for residents of Sloviansk, where in 2014 Ukrainian government forces repulsed Russia-backed separatists after a fierce battle. In the years since, the separatists maintained control over part of the Donbas, and Moscow has now set out to capture the entire region.\n\nAnna Direnskaya, 70, said she and her son and daughter-in-law decided to remain in Sloviansk.\n\n\u201cI lived through 2014. I was also here. I didn\u2019t go anywhere and I don\u2019t want to go anywhere. I am not hiding from myself,\u201d she said while sitting in a wheelchair outside her damaged apartment building. \u201cI want peace.\u201d\n\nDirenskaya, who like many in eastern Ukraine is a native Russian speaker, said she wishes the Russians would understand that Ukrainians are not bad people and there is no enmity between them.\n\n\u201cWhy did this happen? Why is this happening? I don\u2019t know. Tell everyone I want peace and quiet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s president says he will meet Sunday in Kyiv with the U.S. secretary of state and secretary of defense.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke of the plans Saturday during a press conference. He did not immediately share more detail about the visit from Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Saturday. The U.S. State Department also declined comment.\n\nZelenskyy has for weeks urged Western allies to send Ukraine more weapons to counter the Russian invasion.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland and Ukraine have signed an agreement increasing cooperation in the railway transport sector, aiming to help Ukraine maintain its trade exchange with foreign countries as the Russian invasion affects its ports.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Poland\u2019s premier, Mateusz Morawiecki, met on Saturday in Krakow, Poland.\n\nMorawiecki said on Facebook that they both agreed that current sanctions on Russia are insufficient, which can be seen by the condition of the \u201cRussian currency, bonds or inflation.\u201d They appealed to the international community for tougher steps that would stop Russia\u2019s aggression on Ukraine and for more military aid to help Ukraine.\n\nMorawiecki drew special attention to the plight of civilians seeking protection in a steel plant in Mariupol, as he called for the assistance.\n\n\u201cIn Mariupol soldiers \u2013 or rather Russian criminals want to make women and children starve to death. They are waiting until they run out of water. What kind of strategy is that? This is not war. This is genocide.\u201d\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9",

            "text": "Sergey Karaganov has served as a presidential advisor in the Kremlin both under Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin. He is still considered close to Russia\u2019s president and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. His recent proposals on Russian-speaking minorities in the \u201cnear abroad\u201d are known as \u201cPutin doctrine\u201d and Professor Karaganov, who is honorary chair of the Moscow think tank the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy, was first to come out publicly about an all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2019. President Putin has mentioned on Feb. 24 that Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO warrants Russia\u2019s military intervention to prevent it. However, Ukraine didn\u2019t even have a Membership Action Plan for NATO and Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz clearly stated accession was many, many years off.\n\n\n\nHow can an attack be justified on such grounds?\n\n\u00abFor 25 years people like myself have said that NATO expansion would lead to war. Putin said several times that if it came to Ukraine becoming a member of NATO, there would be no Ukraine anymore. In Bucharest in 2008 there was a plan of quick accession of Ukraine and Georgia to NATO. It was blocked by the efforts of Germany and France, but since that time Ukraine has been integrated into NATO. It was pumped up by weaponry and its troops were trained by NATO, their army getting stronger and stronger day by day. In addition we saw a very rapid increase of neo-Nazi sentiment especially among the military, the society and the ruling elite. It was clear that Ukraine had become something like Germany around 1936-1937. The war was inevitable, they were a spearhead of NATO. We made the very hard decision to strike first, before the threat becomes deadlier\u00bb.\n\nBut Ukraine was not about to become a member of NATO, not for at least many, many years. There was time to negotiate.\n\n\u00abWe have heard all kinds of promises by Western leaders throughout these 30 years. But they lied to us or they forgot about their promises. We were told at the beginning that NATO would not expand\u00bb.\n\nHow can you think a non-nuclear medium-sized country like Ukraine would ever attack a nuclear giant like Russia? And how can you think this is a Nazi country with a Jewish president elected with over 70% of the votes?\n\n\u00abUkraine was being built by the US and other NATO countries as a spearhead, maybe of aggression or at least of military pressure, to bring NATO\u2019s military machine closer to the heart of Russia. We can see now how well their forces had been preparing for a war. And Nazis were not only about killing jews. Nazism is about supremacy of one nation over another. Nazism is humiliation of other nations. The regime and the society in Ukraine were going very much like Germany in the 1930s\u00bb.\n\nYou say that NATO promised never to enlarge to the East and Russia was cheated on that. But former Warsaw Pact countries requested to be included in NATO themselves. And Russia signed up to the Founding Act on Russia-NATO relations in 1997, accepting NATO enlargement. No cheating there.\n\n\u00abIt was the biggest mistake of Russia\u2019s foreign policy in the last 30 years. I fought against it, because the Founding Act of 1997 legitimized further NATO expansion. But we signed it because we were desperately poor and we still were trusting in the wisdom of our partners. President Yeltsin probably thought that we would sneak between drops of rain, to no avail. As for NATO, it was formed as a defensive alliance. But when the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia was weak, I was shocked when I saw the rape of Serbia in 1999. Then we had an absolutely atrocious war in Iraq waged by most of the NATO members and then we had another clear-cut aggression in Libya, always by NATO. So we do not trust words. But we know that article 5 of NATO, stating that an attack on a NATO member is an attack to all, doesn\u2019t work. There is no automatic guarantee that NATO would come to the defense of a member under attack. Please read article 5 of the Treaty. But this enlargement is an enlargement of the aggressive alliance. It\u2019s cancer and we wanted to stop this metastasis. We have to do it by a surgical operation. I regret we were unable to prevent such an outcome\u00bb.\n\nWe all agree the Iraq war was illegitimate and was a very serious mistake. Corriere della Sera came out against that war at the time. But one grave mistake doesn\u2019t justify a second grave mistake. And the US people could elect a new leader, Obama, that was against the Iraq war and changed American policy. Can Russians have an opportunity to do the same?\n\n\u00abI don\u2019t think that in the foreseeable future we will have any change of power in Russia, because we are fighting a war of survival. This is a war with the West and people are regrouping around their leader. This is an authoritarian country and the leadership is always very attentive to the moods of the people. But I don\u2019t see real signs of opposition. Also, in the US or else nobody was really punished for the war in Iraq, so we have our doubts about the effectiveness of democracy\u00bb.\n\nYour parallels don\u2019t seem to match. In Libya, Ghaddafi was bombing protest demonstrations from the sky. NATO enforced a no-fly zone that had been called for by a UN Security Council resolution and Russia did not veto it.\n\n\u00abYes. At that time we believed the reassurances of our Western partners. But then we saw a clear-cut aggression devastating the country. That led us toward total distrust of Western countries, and especially of NATO\u00bb.\n\nAs for the intervention in Yugoslavia in 1999, it was made to stop a war that led to over 10,000 deaths and a UN tribunal charged Milosevic for war crimes, deportation and crimes against humanity.\n\n\u00abThe massive killings in former Yugoslavia happened after the NATO\u2019s rape of Serbia. People were killed on all sides. It was a civil war. It was an unspeakable aggression. And the Milosevic trial was a sad and humiliating show by petty people trying to rationalize their previous mistakes if not crimes\u00bb.\n\n\n\nIt was a UN tribunal, not a EU tribunal.\u00abWe don\u2019t acknowledge the right of that tribunal\u00bb.\n\nYou said that the real war now is against Western expansion. What do you mean?\n\n\u00abWe saw Western expansion happening, we see Russophobia in the West reaching levels like antisemitism between the world wars. So war was already becoming likely. And we saw deep pisions and structural problems within Western societies, so we believed that anyway a war was more and more likely. So the Kremlin decided to strike first. Also, this military operation will be used to restructure Russian elite and Russian society. It will become a more militant-based and national-based society, pushing out non-patriotic elements from the elite\u00bb.\n\nThe bottom line question is: Mussolini did not recognize the international order that emerged from the Versailles Treaty in 1919. Does the Kremlin recognize the legitimacy of the European order that emerged from the fall of the Berlin Wall? Do you think this order is legitimate?\u00abWe should not recognize the order that was built against Russia. We tried to integrate in it but we saw it was a Versailles system number 2. I wrote that we had to destroy it. Not by force, but through constructive destruction, through refusal to participate in it. But after the last demand to stop NATO was again rejected, it was decided to use force\u00bb.\n\nSo the overall goal of this war is to overturn the presence of NATO in central and eastern European countries?\n\n\u00abWe see that most of the institutions are, in our view, one-sided and illegitimate. They are threatening Russia and Eastern Europe. We wanted fair peace, but the greed and stupidity of the Americans and the short-sightedness of the Europeans revealed they didn\u2019t want that. We have to correct their mistakes\u00bb.\n\nIs the EU part of the institutions that Russia feels are illegitimate?\n\n\u00abNo, it\u2019s legitimate. But sometimes we dislike EU policies, especially if they become more and more belligerent\u00bb.\n\n\n\nYou seem to believe that an escalation of this war to other countries is inevitable. Is that what you are saying?\n\n\u00abUnfortunately it is becoming more and more likely. Americans and their NATO partners continue support of Ukraine by sending arms. If that continues, it is obvious that targets in Europe could or will be hit in order to stop lines of communications. Then the war could escalate. At this juncture it is becoming more and more plausible. I think the Joint chiefs of staff of US armed forces are of the same opinion as I am\u00bb.\n\nDenazification is what Ukraine seems to have proven by electing a Jewish president. Demilitarization is the opposite of what Mr. Putin has achieved, as this attack led Ukraine to get heavy weaponry from the West. Plus, Germany and the EU are rearming too, NATO has moved troops closer to Russia\u2019s borders, Western sanctions are now much tighter, while Europe and the US got closer together and Russia is becoming financially isolated. Would you say Putin\u2019s military operation is proving a success, so far?\n\n\u00abNazism is not only about antisemitism. It is about hating and suppressing all other nationalities. And it was taking over Ukraine. We never know how the military operations end. Demilitarization means destruction of Ukrainian military forces \u2013 that is happening and will accelerate. Of course, if Ukraine is supported with new weapons, that could prolong the agony. We can only talk about \u201cvictory\u201d in quotes, because there are many casualties on both the Russian and the Ukrainian side. The war will be victorious, in one way or another. I assume demilitarization will be achieved and there will be denazification, too. Like we did in Germany and in Chechnya. Ukrainians will become much more peaceful and friendly to us\u00bb.\n\nBut so far the Russian military had to withdraw after keeping Kiev under siege for one month. It doesn\u2019t look like the military operation is going so well, does it?\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s a large military operation, so it has secrets in the way it\u2019s waged. What if the Kiev operation was meant to distract Ukrainian forces and keep them away from the main theater in the South and South-East? Maybe that was the plan. Moreover Russian troops have been very careful not to hit civilian targets, we used only 30-35% of the lethal weapons that we could use. If we had used everything, that would have meant the destruction of Ukrainian cities and a much quicker victory. We did not do carpet bombing like Americans in Iraq. The endgame probably will be a new treaty, maybe with Zelensky still there. Probably it would mean the creation of a country in South and South-East Ukraine that is friendly to Russia. Maybe there will be several Ukraines. But at this juncture it is impossible to predict because, of course, it\u2019s an open-ended story. We are in the fog of war\u00bb.\n\n\n\nThere is clear evidence that civilians have been targeted and killed by the Russian in Mariupol, in Bucha and elsewhere. These look very much like war crimes and crimes against humanity and they were deliberate. Should they be persecuted?\n\n\u00abThe Bucha story is completely fake-staged, it\u2019s a provocation\u00bb.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look staged at all.\n\n\u00abI watched the pictures and I am 99% sure. But more in general there is a war and civilians suffer. We know that Ukrainian neoNazi forces have been using civilians as living shields, especially in Mariupol. We have different pictures with you\u00bb.\n\nIt\u2019s rather the opposite: the Russian army did not allow humanitarian corridors.\n\n\u00abWe opened them. They were blocked by nationalist forces. I know how our military operates but, of course, this is a war. We face a tragedy\u00bb.\n\nDid you expect this level of cohesion between Europe and the US?\n\n\u00abWell, the cohesion will collapse because of the problems of the West. But for the time being they were organizing even before this conflict. The West is failing and losing its position in the world, so it needs an enemy \u2013 for the moment we are the enemy. I don\u2019t think the unity will last, Europe will not commit the suicide by choosing to lose its independence. I hope our European neighbors will recuperate from this dizziness of hatred\u00bb.\n\nYou speak like some other country started this war, in fact Russia started it.\n\n\u00abI was not for this particular scenario, but it happened. And I support my country. The West committed several aggressions. We are now on the same moral level, we are equal, we are doing more or less like you. I regret that we lost our moral superiority. But we are fighting an existential war\u00bb.\n\nSanctions are getting tighter. Will Russia become more dependent on China?\n\n\u00abThere is no question about that: we will be more integrated and more dependent on China. It has positive elements but overall we will be much more dependent. I am not very much afraid of becoming a pawn of China like some EU states became pawns of the US. First, Russians have a core gene of sovereignty. Second, we are culturally different from the Chinese, I don\u2019t think that China could or would like to overtake us. However we are not happy with the situation, because I would have preferred to have better relations with Europe. But Chinese are our close allies and friends and the biggest source of Russian strength after Russian people themselves. We are a source of their strength. I would prefer to end this confrontation with Europe. My calculation was to create a safe Western flank to compete more effectively In the Asian world of tomorrow\u00bb.\n\nYou declared that China, not Russia, will emerge as the victor in this war. What did you mean?\n\n\u00abWe will be victorious because Russians always are in the end. But in the meantime we will lose a lot. We will lose people. We will lose financial resources and we will become poorer for the time being. But we are ready to sacrifice in order to build a more viable and fair international system. We are talking about Ukraine, but we really want to build a different international system than the one that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union and, in turn, is now collapsing. We all are sinking into chaos now. We would like to build Fortress Russia to defend ourselves from this chaos, even if we are getting poorer for this. Unfortunately the chaos could take over Europe, if Europe doesn\u2019t act according to its interests. What Europe is doing right now is absolutely suicidal\u00bb.\n\nIs that a threat? Don\u2019t you think nuclear deterrence still applies?\n\n\u00abI know that officially under certain circumstances the US could use nuclear weapons for the defense of Europe and they allegedly could fight for the defense of Europe against a nuclear superpower. There is a 1% chance this might happen, so we have to be careful. But if a n American president takes such a decision inviting devastating response it would mean he is insane\u00bb.\n\nThis war doesn\u2019t look sustainable, including for Russia. It can\u2019t go on for long. What are the elements to agree at least on a real ceasefire?\n\n\u00abFirst, Ukraine must be a completely demilitarized neutral country \u2013 no heavy arms, for whatever of Ukraine remains. This should be guaranteed by outside powers, including Russia, and no military exercises should take place in the country if one of the guarantors is against it. Ukraine should be a peaceful buffer, hopefully sending back some of the arms systems deployed in recent years\u00bb.\n\nUkraine needs security guarantees, it needs to be able to defend itself or it will not be a sovereign country anymore.\n\n\u00abI am sorry but Italy and most European countries cannot defend themselves either\u00bb.\n\nThey belong to NATO\u2026\n\n\u00abThey have been saving on security. That is how they got themselves into this awkward position that Europe is not considered to be a serious actor in the world. Switzerland and Austria are neutral, but are safe. So can Ukraine\u00bb.\n\nDo you realize that after what you just said, the debate in Italy will move towards investing more on defense?\n\n\u00abYou are welcome. One of the grave mistakes of the Europeans in the last decades is that they didn\u2019t invest in their security, under their ideal of eternal peace. But I think European nations should be able to defend themselves, because they have real threats coming from the South and the world is becoming a very dangerous place as international relations are collapsing. The question is more against whom Italy would like to arm. Against Russia? Well, that would be insane. But you need a more robust military force. You are living in a very dangerous place in the world. If you depend on America, you are selling out your own security and sovereignty because the Americans have their own interests\u00bb.\n\nThe EU seems to be moving towards cutting dependence from Russian energy \u2013 first coal, then oil and finally natural gas. Did you expect that?\n\n\u00abI hope you are not suicidal. Of course that would damage Russia, too, but Europe would undermine its economy and its social situation. I hope it will not happen, because you can calculate your own interests. If you don\u2019t want our coal, we will sell it somewhere else. If you don\u2019t want our oil, after a time and some losses, we will sell it elsewhere. And if you don\u2019t want gas, well, well, we can also eventually redirect it after some suffering. Russians support Putin at 81% now, people are ready for a rough period\u00bb.\n\nDo you think Italy and Europe could do something to broker a deal?\n\n\u00abNot easy, given the situation. But what they could do is try to stop this Russophobia, akin anti-semitism of the previous centuries, this satanization of Russia that would lead us eventually to a worse confrontation than we have now. Even Russian culture is being erased in Europe by a new cancel culture\u00bb.\n\nFrom our partner RIAC",

But Ukrianian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also pointing the finger at former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He invited her to Bucha, to see for herself \"what the policy of 14 years of concessions to Russia has led to.\"\n\nIt was 14 years ago, in 2008, that Merkel, together with France's then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, helped block NATO's membership invitation to Ukraine during an alliance summit in Bucharest. They saw it as a provocation to Russia.\n\nZelenskyy has called that decision a \"miscalculation\" that has led to Ukraine now \"fighting for our lives in the most horrific war in Europe since World War II.\"\n\nDespite the rejection, NATO allies did agree at the summit to an unspecified timeline for Ukraine, along with Georgia, to become members.\n\nWatch video 03:04 'Mood in Germany has shifted significantly' after Bucha atrocities\n\nNord Stream 2 despite Crimea\n\nMerkel's government continued to deny Ukraine weapons deliveries after Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. At the same time, Germany approved the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under the Baltic \u2014 which meant less gas potentially flowing through Ukraine, from which the country earns transit fees.\n\n\"How else should Moscow understand that than as a tacit acceptance of a violent border shift?\" said Henning Hoff, the executive editor of Internationale Politik Quarterly, a magazine from the German Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nGermany's EU partners, such as Poland, have also noted Merkel's silence on the issue.\n\n\"Ms. Chancellor, you have said nothing since the beginning of the war,\" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said. \"German policy in the last 10 to 15 years has led to today's Russia enjoying a strength based on its monopoly over the sale of raw materials.\"\n\nMerkel's successor, Olaf Scholz, has blocked important sanctions from the European Union, he added.\n\nWatch video 03:52 Should trade with Russia continue?\n\nForeign policy as self-deception\n\nThe criticism goes beyond the previous and current German chancellors. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's president and former foreign minister, has also been accused of cozy relations with Russia.\n\n\"The relationship was fundamental, even holy, regardless what happened,\" Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, wrote in the Tagesspiegel, a German daily. \"Even an unprovoked war makes no difference.\"\n\nIt is among the harshest criticism an ambassador has ever publicly leveled at a German official.\n\nThe last 30 years of German foreign, security and trade policies are being called into question. \"Much too much dialogue and much too little hardball with the Kremlin,\" Melnyk wrote.\n\nFormer Chancellor Schr\u00f6der has entertained the closest ties with Putin, but other former leaders are now in hot water over their policies of appeasing the Kremlin\n\n\"Every German government since Putin became president has signaled that a smooth relationship with Moscow is more important than the fate of Ukraine. This encouraged the Kremlin's attack,\" Stephan Bierling, a political scientist at the University of Regensburg, told DW.\n\nCritics, including the United States and EU countries, have noted that Germany's adherence to a policy of Wandel durch Handel (\"change through trade\") is not limited to dealings with Russia, but with China, too. They have warned that engagement without strings attached will not lead to the desired liberalization of these autocratic regimes.\n\nAdmitting mistakes\n\nSteinmeier has since admitted that many aspects of Germany's Russia policy were \"poor assessments.\" Sticking to Nord Stream 2 has cost the country credibility, he said, but it was impossible to know how Putin would act.\n\nThe second Chechen War, which was raging as Putin first assumed the presidency, was already evidence of his \"criminal, hypernationalist\" character, Hoff said.\n\nMerkel, in a statement through a spokesperson, has stuck to her decision to block Ukraine's NATO accession, which remains the general position of the alliance itself, even as many of its members send Ukraine weapons with which to fight Russian troops. That includes Germany, in a major reversal of policy not to supply weapons to parties actively involved in conflict.\n\nZelenskyy, Merkel, Macron, and Putin met in 2019 under the Normandy format to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine\n\nRoom for negotiation\n\nDespite the strong criticism, and calls to beef up the Bundeswehr, there remains interest in Germany's playing a diplomatic role. In negotiations with Putin, \"we need Chancellor Olaf Scholz's personal leadership,\" Melnyk told the news agency Reuters. \"This would be a litmus test for the new German foreign policy.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian ambassador has also expressed support for the Normandy Format, a peace initiative between France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, which began under Merkel and Melnyk said he wants to see Scholz continue.\n\nThat comes with one condition: The Ukrainians want to bring the United States into those talks, which so far the EU powers have been reluctant to do.\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Every billboard also has a slogan reading \u201cStop Russia now!\u201d A separate billboard says that \u201cblood oil fuels Russia\u2019s genocide of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRusza kampania #StopRussiaNow.

Nothing special is happening there,\u201d he said, adding that restrictions might have some effect, but only in the long run.\n\nMorawiecki then called for \u201ccrushing sanctions \u2026 much stronger than those that have been imposed.\u201d The move comes as Washington and Brussels are reportedly discussing sanctions designed to hit Russia\u2019s energy sector. So far, Western nations have mostly targeted Russian finances and banking, while the EU has also banned Russia\u2019s coal imports.\n\nWhile the US introduced a total ban on energy from Russia, which was echoed by Canada, Australia, and Japan, EU member states have been split on the matter. Many European nations largely dependent on Russia\u2019s energy imports opposed an outright immediate ban on Russian oil and gas.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned in March that cutting off such imports immediately could cause \u201cmass unemployment, poverty, people who can\u2019t heat their homes.\u201d Austria admitted on Saturday that it simply cannot afford to ban imports of Russian gas.\n\nEven the US has been cautious about the possibility of an EU-wide oil and gas embargo against Russia, arguing it could drastically increase global oil prices and harm economies in Europe and beyond.\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.",

Around 700 million denial-of-service attacks mainly from outside of Europe were launched against the websites of the Estonian president, foreign ministry, police and public services agencies on Thursday and Friday, the Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team said.\n\nThe impact has so far been minimal, the authority said. The website of a NATO cybersecurity center in Estonia, which this week hosted a global exercise with 2,000 participants from 32 countries, was among the websites that were temporarily down. The pro-Kremlin hacker group Killnet has claimed to be behind the attacks, a military spokeswoman said on Friday.\n\nHalliburton Says It Must End Some Deals in Russia by May 15 (5:13 p.m.)\n\nHalliburton Co. said that sanctions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other nations require the company to wind down certain contracts in Russia by May 15.\n\nThe company also said that the total net book value of its assets in Russia is about $340 million, and warned the invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions could cause the company to take a charge related to those assets.\n\nEU Suggests Companies Should Keep Paying for Russia Gas in Euros (5:03 p.m.)\n\nThe European Union has suggested that companies could keep paying for gas in euros, as it published guidance that Moscow\u2019s decree calling for payment in rubles would violate sanctions.\n\nThe commission confirmed a preliminary assessment that the decree would run against European sanctions imposed on Russia. It also said the decree doesn\u2019t automatically preclude allowing companies to continue paying in euros, and the scope for exemptions is not yet clear. The commission advised companies to seek confirmation from Moscow that this was possible.\n\nU.S. Leaves World Bank-IMF Meeting in Protest as Russia Speaks (4:46 p.m.)\n\nOfficials representing the U.S., Germany, Japan, and other nations walked out of a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund gathering on Friday when Russia\u2019s envoy started speaking, the second such action at a high-profile gathering in Washington this week, people familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe representatives were attending a meeting of the institution\u2019s development committee, according to the people, who declined to be identified because the gathering is private. The committee is a ministerial-level forum of the World Bank and the IMF for intergovernmental consensus-building on development issues and has 25 members, usually ministers of finance or development, according to its website.\n\nRussia Faces \u2018Reverse Industrialization\u2019 Amid Sanctions (2:11 p.m.)\n\nRussia faces a deep and prolonged economic contraction along with higher inflation and reduced living standards, as sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies sap it of vital products and technology, according to economists at the central bank.\n\nIn its most detailed public statement on the outlook since the war started, the Bank of Russia warned that \u201cthe depth of the contraction may be quite significant and exit trajectory drawn out in time\u201d because the supply shocks triggered by sanctions are unlikely to fade quickly. It said Russia would experience \u201creverse industrialization\u201d as sanctions forced it to seek lower-tech replacements for western goods that were cut off.\n\nGeneral Says Kremlin Seeks Full Control of Southern Ukraine (11:04 a.m.)\n\nA top general said the Kremlin aims to secure control of the entire south of Ukraine as well as the eastern Donbas region, Russia\u2019s state-run Tass and RIA Novosti reported.\n\nMajor General Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Central Military District, spoke in Ekaterinburg. It\u2019s unclear whether his statements reflect official Kremlin objectives.\n\nRussia wants to create a land bridge to Crimea as well to influence key aspects of Ukraine\u2019s economy, including major Black Sea ports, he said. Ultimately the Kremlin wants access to Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria, which lies to the northwest of Odesa.\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "text": "\u00a9 Getty Images / simon2579 via RT\n\nMandelaw Bageru\n\nmandelawb@gmail.com\n\nFormed in the aftermath of World War II, NATO is a military alliance built on the principle of collective defense \u2014 meaning that all NATO countries agree to come to the defense of any individual member that comes under attack. Russia considers NATO to be a direct threat, and Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the possibility that Ukraine might join motivated his decision to launch the Russian invasion. Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry has also warned of serious military and political consequences if Sweden and Finland join the alliance. All these three countries are lately seeking to do that.\n\nSo is it worth provoking Putin and Russia to add Ukraine, Sweden, and Finland into the NATO alliance club? This issue requires serious look beyond the current hasty phobia-led and unequal political standing among nations.\n\nRussia\u2019s NATO-coerced invasion of parts of Eastern Ukraine has brought the dangerous likelihood of nuclear war into a new contemporary global political focus. Sadly, in response to the Russo-Ukraine protracted war crisis, many countries are opting to boost their respective military spending, much to the delight of weapons contractors and the arms industry. Even more alarming are the calls for increased investments in nuclear capabilities by nuclear-armed states, and the calls for deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons into countries that currently do not host them.\n\nIt is clearly known for generations how the four-pronged phobias have been causing inequality among global nations, simply rooted in erroneously perceived generalities of: (a) Russo-phobia, (b) Sino-phobia (c) Islam-phobia and (d) Afro-phobia. These phobic and irrational attitudes can easily trigger the jeopardy for nuclear bomb possibilities and the 3rd world war to occur suddenly.\n\nNuclear Bomb Proliferation and Flexing for Fight\n\nIt has been proven time and time again that on its own nuclear weapon can upset and/or destroy a city, by killing hundreds of thousands or even millions of people.\n\nFor instance, according to NukeMap:\n\nIf the largest Russian nuclear bomb were to be dropped on New York City, then over eight million people would be killed, and another nearly seven million injured. The U.S. already has an estimated one hundred nuclear weapons in Europe. Five NATO countries \u2014 Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Germany \u2014 take part in a nuclear sharing arrangement, each hosting twenty U.S. nuclear weapons. Germany, in addition to hosting U.S. nukes, is also ramping up its military spending to the tune of 100 billion Euros. In a major shift in German policy, the country has committed to spending more than 2% of its GDP on the military. Germany has also committed to buying US-made F-35 aircraft \u2014 jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons \u2014 to replace its own Tornado fighter jets. In Poland, a country that borders Ukraine and Russian ally \u2013 Belarus, does not have any nuclear weapons, yet, the leader of the ruling right-wing national-conservative Law and Justice Party says they are now \u201copen\u201d to the US putting nuclear weapons there.\n\nThe nuclear fever isn\u2019t just in Europe. China is accelerating its nuclear buildup amidst the rising fears of conflicts with the U.S.A \u2014 with Taiwan as a forthcoming flashpoint. On its part, China plans to build one hundred land-based nuclear missile silos, and a Pentagon report claims they\u2019ll have one thousand nuclear warheads by the end of the decade. This will add to the nearly thirteen thousand nuclear weapons that already exist globally. China is also nearing completion of its own nuclear triad \u2014 the ability to launch nuclear weapons by land, sea, and air \u2014 which, according to conventional wisdom, would secure its nuclear deterrence strategy.\n\nAdditionally, North Korea has restarted its ICBM program and recently launched a test missile for the first time since 2017. North Korea claims the missile to be a \u201cpowerful nuclear war deterrent,\u201d the same rationale every other nuclear-armed country uses for building and maintaining nuclear weapons.\n\nU.S. allies in the region aren\u2019t immune to the calls for nuclear weapons. Influential former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, who has long pushed for a more militarized Japan, recently called for the country to consider hosting U.S. nuclear weapons \u2014 despite Japan being the only place on Earth to know firsthand the horror wrought directly onto people by a nuclear-weapons attack. Luckily, the comments received pushback from current leader Fumio Kishida, who called the idea \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nBut too many leaders are not responsibly resisting the call for more nuclear weapons. Rather, neighboring countries to Russia like Finland, Sweden and others in the region are in hurry to be admitted into the NATO-Forces-Club in an attempt to squeeze Russia out of shape.\n\nOn his part, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, besides his calls for a No-Fly Zone, he recently told 60 Minutes: \u201cThe world is saying today that some people are politically hiding behind claims that \u2018we cannot stand up for Ukraine because there could be a nuclear war\u2026believing that by not helping Ukraine, you will hide from Russian nukes. I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019\u201d Zelensky appears to suggest that no matter if the West engages in a direct conventional military confrontation with Russia or not, a nuclear confrontation is a foregone conclusion. Zelensky\u2019s language that implies unavoidable nuclear attacks and a necessity for increased military intervention only pushes Russia closer to launching a nuclear attack \u2014 and the world toward a global nuclear war. This is not a path that Ukraine or the world should want to take. What is needed is more diplomacy.\n\nThe U.S. hasn\u2019t made things better. Instead, it is blatantly refusing to adopt \u201cno first use\u201d as official policy, the same nuclear policy shared by Russia \u2014 a policy that is striking fear across the globe right now, including majority of people in the U.S. who are now worried about a nuclear attack. This is doubly alarming considering the U.S.\u2019s history of fabricating evidence to go to war, as happened with George W. Bush\u2019s lies about WMDs in Iraq and the falsified Gulf of Tonkin incident that was used as a pretext to escalate the Vietnam War.\n\nCredibility of the Human Rights Council\n\nOn 7 April the UN General Assembly (GA) decided to suspend Russia\u2019s membership in the Human Rights Council. This hasty action establishes a destructive precedent not only for the future of the Human Rights Council, but also for the future of other United Nations institutions\u2019 existence and exercises around the globe. This biased action doesn\u2019t promote transparency. Rather, it challenges the idea that a few powerful countries can tank not only the Security Council initiatives but also the GA, without much is justified as a consensus or an explanation.\n\nObviously, this undigested hurried move was a big blow to Russia\u2019s prestige at the UN-forums, and adds bad precedence to the latent yet general atmosphere of Russo-phobia provoked by NATO pact hooligans. In the past we have seen similar collective actions imposed on a number of nations as well. This sets supremacy attitudes in the future in which unbalanced efforts will be made to exclude other countries from membership in the Human Rights Council too.\n\nIf the political trail is managed fairly, then, one could think of excluding several NATO countries or even NATO itself as an entity, for the war crimes and crimes committed against humanity by NATO forces during the wars of aggression against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and former Yugoslavia. Incidentally, one could think of excluding the UK for having extended its colonial arms invisibly through Saudi Arabia because of the protracted civil war committed in intensifying civil strife among ethnic groups in Yemen; or between Pakistan and India for its systematic war crimes and gross violations of human rights against the people of Kashmir, including widespread extra-judicial executions.\n\nAnother credible candidate for suspension would have been Azerbaijan because of its aggression against the unfortunate Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh during the Blitzkrieg of September-November 2020, where war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed, including torture and execution of Armenian prisoners of war. We could think of excluding for using its puppet regimes forcibly appointed in Colombia to carryout lethal para-military activities and consistent pattern of killing human rights defenders, social activist leaders, syndicalist and indigenous peoples.\n\nThus, it is not worth shedding popular tears over the UN Human Rights Council, whose authority and credibility are seriously jeopardized and still remain questionable; and whose resolutions are routinely ignored by many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel. Since its formation in 2006 the Human Rights Council has not served human rights well \u2013 but it has certainly served the geopolitical and informational interests of the global expansionist club members including, but not limited to, United States, the European Union, and the NATO alliance member countries.\n\nThe GA decision also puts a further nail on the coffin of the UN-General Assembly itself. It manifests how this Assembly can and is manipulated by the United States and by the bullying, arm-twisting and blackmailing practices of the Department of State. Countries have been overtly told to: \u201cTake the US-NATO way, or else, take the highway.\u201d\n\nFar more serious for the world are the economic sanctions and financial blockade imposed by the US and EU countries on Russia, which will have a long-lasting impact on the world economy, hurting the most vulnerable not only in Russia, but also in Europe, Africa, North and South America, and Asia.\n\nThe decision of the UN-General Assembly (GA) sets a dangerous precedent and further politicizes the Human Rights Council. One would think that precisely because some countries do not like what Russia is doing that they would like to \u201ctame\u201d it by involving it in the human rights work of the Council. Isolating a country is always counter-productive. What is needed is greater inclusion and greater debate \u2013 not exclusion and hate-mongering. In this respect, the GA vote illustrates the success of the \u201cinformation war\u201d that has been waged against Russia for decades \u2013 not just since 2022, not even since 2014 and the Maidan coup \u2013 long before there was systematic dis-information about Russia and a consistent negative narrative. This has a simple explanation: NATO has had no raison d\u2019\u00eatre since the Warsaw Pact was dismantled in 1991. In order to continue existing, NATO must have an \u201cenemy\u201d \u2013 and that is the only role that the US and NATO assigned to Russia. The Russian bogeyman is necessary and guarantees that the US military-industrial-financial complex can continue its war on the world and on the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n\nSignals Put Before the General Assembly\n\nThe allegations of war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces in Bucha in the vicinity of Kiev precipitated this move by the US to have Russia removed from the Human Rights Council. How much do we know about the events? While Ukraine accused Russia of murdering 400 civilians in Bucha before retreating from the town, the Russian government has refuted these allegations, pointing out that Russian forces withdrew in an orderly fashion on 30 March and that no allegations of extra judicial executions were made until 2 April 2022, four days later, when Ukrainian security forces and TV cameras arrived in Bucha. The US and NATO accepted Kiev\u2019s claims uncritically and used them to justify imposing further sanctions against Russia. However, serious doubts have arisen about a possible staged events and tampering with the photos and videos. After all, fake news has been in the global arena sawing intentionally spread misinformation propaganda news in recent decades since the war in Iraq.\n\nSo the serious question is: Do we have here another false flag operation as we have seen multiple times in Iraq Syria and Libya, staged chemical attacks that could not be confirmed by expert inspectors? Are the dead persons\u2019 civilians or military? Were the bodies of those of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian-civilian-victims of artillery bombardment? Were the bodies Russian soldiers wearing white armbands or Ukrainian civilians with white armbands to signal their peaceful intentions and subsequently lynched by Ukrainian extremists for collaboration with the Russians? One day we may find out whether the US had advance knowledge of the alleged crimes in Bucha or whether it was involved in manufacturing fake evidence for the information and psychological warfare. Of course, nobody knows. What we need is whistleblowers, more like Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. The classical mass media is no longer trustworthy; it has been long time since it proved to stage fake news even utilizing its social media wing.\n\nAn international commission of inquiry should investigate, but that will take time, because the evidence on the ground (to the extent it has not been destroyed) must be evaluated and witnesses on all sides must be heard. Gradually some information is coming out that does not confirm Ukrainian claims, and in a series of recorded satellite phone calls, a reporter identified as \u201cSimon\u201d tells his colleagues that at Borodyanka \u201cthere\u2019s no bodies in the streets at all\u201d, contrary to what he had been led to believe.\n\nApparently the town had been \u201cshelled to pieces\u201d, but it is not clear whether this was committed by Russian or Ukrainian artillery. In any event, Simon concluded \u201cthere is no evidence of any rights abuses here\u201d. Simon and his crew interviewed residents who reported that the Russian soldiers had been correct and given them food, water and other supplies. Simon concluded: \u201cI do not know what the prosecutor was talking about, but we have seen nothing like that. It is a completely different picture.\u201d An international investigation is justified and necessary, but any ad hoc commission must investigate allegations of crimes committed not only by Russian soldiers but also by Ukrainian soldiers and para-militaries, in particular against the Russian-Ukrainians of Lugansk and Donetsk since 2014, and the pogrom against 50 Russian-Ukrainians in Odessa in May 2014.\n\nTherefore, it could be said without fear of contradiction, that the GA vote was prematurely orchestrated hasty and coercive and cursive drama that left an added failure by this global entity. Sad enough, the GA violated the general principles of law concerning due process to be followed and the presumption of innocence. Above all, with due respect, the GA must have given the floor and the opportunity to entertain Russia\u2019s evidence and arguments and given due weight for conflict triggering matters with all fairness. The absence of due process is yet another disgrace for the General Assembly to gang up and take irrational, persuasive, hooligan type of nosy decision making forum without having any evidence put forward from either side to backstop its hasty resolution.\n\nThe UN-General Assembly\u2019s Double Standards\n\nThis is not the first and will not be the last time that the UN-General Assembly (GA) applies double standards and adopts flawed resolutions or decisions simply to please The USA, EU and the NATO alliance. It seems like the entire United Nations system has been hijacked by the West and has the full support of a homologated corporate media that acts as the echo chamber of the State Department.\n\nAnother example of shaky-double-standards and selective indignation: The International Criminal Court. We hear politicians demand a \u201cNuremberg\u201d Trial against Putin. Well, why not a Tribunal to investigate and condemn the crimes of aggression committed by Bill Clinton in Yugoslavia, by George W. Bush and Tony Blair in Iraq, by Barack Obama in Libya, Syria and Ukraine (after all, Obama was president when the \u201cno fly\u201d zone over Libya was manipulated for \u201cregime change\u201d. Worldwide, it has been recalled Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous words: \u201cWe came, we saw, he died\u201d.\n\nAny tribunal show should clearly investigate the crimes committed by Ukrainian sharp-shooters at Maidan in connection with the 2014 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the democratically elected President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovich. Was it not the legitimate legal duty or responsibility of the International Criminal Court also to investigate and prosecute the NATO forces from the US, UK, Germany, and Australia, who committed atrocities in Afghanistan and Iraq? How about the torture centers used in clandestine in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay? How about the use of indiscriminate weapons including depleted uranium weapons, white phosphorus and cluster bombs, causing tens of thousands of deaths? How about all the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d visited upon civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya?\n\nWhere is the accountability for all of these crimes? The International Criminal Court will not have any credibility until it decides to apply the Statute of Rome seriously and go after the likes of George W. Bush and Joe Biden. Hitherto the West has \u201cgotten away with it\u201d \u2013 but for how long? Will the ICC remain in the service of the West, as a strong arm of the Pentagon? Hitherto we have observed the culture of impunity that protects Western leaders. Will the rule of law ever evolve into the rule of justice? This is the real unanswered question that remains in limbo.\n\nInternational Court of Justice (ICC)\n\nEstablished in 2002 by the Rome Statute, the ICC has 123 member states where it can investigate and prosecute crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and state acts of aggression. (Ukraine has also not formally joined the court, but has submitted to its jurisdiction in the past.\n\nInternational court of Justice (ICC) affairs, after World War II, the prominent Nuremberg trials, led by the U.S. and allied powers, prosecuted Nazi war criminals. The U.S. has also backed international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone, which have held high-ranking individuals accountable for terrible crimes.\n\nBut the trouble to put the ICC into effective appliance of justice is when a state is too powerful to be bound by ICC\u2019s demands and decisions. The problem isn\u2019t about the absence of globally assured law but rather its breakdown, when states refuse to comply and aren\u2019t held accountable. This can further inflame conflicts unequal treatment of weaker nations in front of the ICC. The resulting pattern of war, displacement, and rampant human rights violations we\u2019re seeing in Ukraine has tragically become all too familiar due to the provocation of the 30 NATO pact members due to the Russophobes and their hooligan actions to squeeze and suffocate the Russian Republics and its citizens. So Russia had to protect itself before NATO takes over Ukraine against the treatment it signed in previous years.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not just Russia that seems not to pay attention to what the ICC rules and regulations are all about. Since the recent past, side-lining the ICC is true of the USA as well.\n\nFirstly, when President Bill Clinton signed the Rome Statute, he advised against U.S. ratification out of concern that the court could assert jurisdiction over U.S. officials and service members. Secondly, President George W. Bush then famously \u201cunsigned\u201d the Rome Statute less than one year before his illegal invasion of Iraq. Thirdly, when the Trump administration went so far as to sanction ICC prosecutors who were investigating possible U.S. crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nThe most powerful nations like U.S., China, Russia, India, etc., should have set exemplary relationships with the ICC \u2014 and the global rule of law more broadly. Yet on its part, the ICC is more tilted to the Western powers and active in helping the USA and NATO pact members in their intervention to upset weaker nations in their own rights than to sand firm equally to all its members with due respect and fairness.\n\nLooking at a resolution now in the USA Congress introduced by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) that calls for the U.S. to join the ICC, it is certain this will also be side lined as business as usual. That means, another resolution is required to repeal the 2002 law that prohibits the U.S. A\u2019s support for ICC investigations.\n\nIn principle, no country should stand in the way of accountability and remedy for global victims of conflict, whether in Ukraine, Palestine, Yemen, or elsewhere. This includes the United States, which must also reckon with its own crimes committed during the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine.\n\nUsually, Washington has been seeking supremacy by imposing ad hoc rules by masking itself under the mantle of human rights violation, humanitarian aids, and violation of international law. These are systematically devised excuses meant to advance both the US and NATO\u2019s joint militaristic interests at the cost of upsetting lives and livelihoods in Ukraine and elsewhere around the globe.\n\n\u201cWe cannot successfully cooperate with the rest of the world in establishing a reign of law,\u201d warned Robert H. Jackson, the chief U.S. prosecutor at Nuremberg, \u201cunless we are prepared to have that law sometimes operate against what would be our national advantage.\u201d\n\nFrom the outset, it was clear, Russia is among the nations who would not submit itself to Washington\u2019s will of global dominance. Instead, Russia, China and India are working hard to strengthen efforts aimed at the Non-allied nations\u2019 forum for power balance. In this regard, just like China, Russia is fighting to be part of an international community of equals and will not allow Western nations to ignore its legitimate security concerns which it attempted to clarify far ahead of the NATO proxy attempt to expand itself into Ukraine and further squeeze Russia outside of the global political and economic arena. In self-defense, Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine is meant to put an end to NATO\u2019s regional domination as well as the US-dominated world order.\n\nThe answer to the threat of nuclear weapons is not more nuclear weapons. The answer is a planet that engages in genuine disarmament with a goal of no nuclear weapons. The answer is to strengthen an international community of equals that will not easily consent Western nations to ignore their respective legitimate security concerns nationally and regionally.\n\nYet, Law alone won\u2019t deliver global justice. But if we want fewer wars, more diplomacy, and more international cooperation, then no country can remain above it.\n\n__\n\n\n\n\n\nTo publish article on borkena, please send a submission to info@borkena.com for consideration.\n\nJoin the conversation.

            "text": "Former President Dmitry Medvedev's opinion article in the daily Kommersant in October 2021, ahead of Russia's massive military buildup along the Ukrainian border, was as surreal as it was acerbic.\n\nMedvedev, who owes his political career and his seemingly enormous wealth to Russian President Vladimir Putin, lashed out at Ukraine's leaders, calling them \"weak,\" \"nonindependent,\" and corrupt and adding there was no sense in negotiating with them.\n\nIn the article, which Western analysts described as \"chauvinistic,\" Medvedev described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, as beholden to \"the most rabid nationalist forces\" and accused him of \"completely chang[ing]\" his political and moral compass.\n\n\"One can only imagine how revolting it was for [Zelenskiy] to commit such a moral somersault,\" he said in the October 11 commentary.\n\nTo many Kremlin observers, Medvedev could have been talking about himself.\n\nThe 56-year-old former lawyer once represented the hopes of Russian liberals seeking democratic change. When Putin picked him to become president in 2008, many put doubts about the motives of the senior partner in the ruling \"tandem\" aside and latched onto the idea that reforms were in the offing.\n\nNearly 15 years later, a different Medvedev jumps out from the page. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 and has remained in the Kremlin ever since, steadily shutting the door on dissent and bringing the country into increasing confrontation with Kyiv and the West.\n\nAnd in recent months, as Putin narrowed his inner circle to a handful of hard-liners, launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, and taken the clampdown in Russia to new levels, Medvedev has done a flip -- at least verbally -- to stay in his patron's good graces.\n\nThe October commentary was one of several caustic articles, social-media posts, or remarks that Medvedev has issued in recent months, some of them echoing the outlandish kind of historical revisionism that Putin has used to vilify the West and underpin the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBellicose Name-Calling\n\nIn Russia's current bilious climate, with officials, lawmakers, and state TV guests seemingly vying to top one another in terms of belligerence, they may not seem outlandish. But they sharply contrast with Medvedev's established image as a mild-mannered, iPhone-toting technocrat.\n\n\"It's not so much the content. It's the tone -- the name calling. I don't remember Medvedev being like that earlier in his career,\" Brian Taylor, a professor of political science at Syracuse University who focuses on Russian politics, told RFE/RL. He said that Medvedev -- who lost a lot of power and influence when he was ousted as prime minister two years ago -- is trying to \"stay relevant\" politically.\n\nIn a March social-media post, Medvedev compared Polish, Slovak, and Czech leaders traveling by train to Kyiv to show support to Zelenskiy -- a transportation choice dictated by Russia's war in Ukraine -- to Vladimir Lenin's return trip to Russia from self-imposed exile in 1917, ahead of the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nMedvedev claimed that the Polish elite suffers from Russophobia due to anger over having lost control of the throne in Moscow 400 years ago -- an assertion that ignores far greater and more recent factors, such as the decades of repressive Soviet dominance over Poland and its neighbors.\n\nTimothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University who is an author and an expert on the region, called the post \"grotesque\" and said that Medvedev was trying to position himself as a populist speaking for ordinary citizens in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"But he is himself a caricature of the global elite, wealthy for no reason, trying to dictate to people in a foreign country what they should do and how they should think, endorsing a war of destruction in the name of nothing more, in the end, than his own personal comfort,\" Snyder wrote in a blog post.\n\nStanding By His Man, And His Money\n\nA 2017 investigation by now-imprisoned opposition leader Aleksei Navalny and his associates alleged that Medvedev used an array of charity and nonprofit organizations to collect $1.2 billion in donations from tycoons and state banks and then redirected the funds to purchase pricey assets, including luxury homes.\n\nMaria Snegovaya, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank, says the upsurge in Medvedev's belligerent public rhetoric is an attempt to demonstrate loyalty to Putin at a time of growing political infighting. \"Medvedev may want to signal to everyone that he is part of the system, that he is essentially by Putin's side,\" she told RFE/RL.\n\n\"I think he is desperate to at least secure some safety. His goal right now is to survive [within the system], not to climb his way back on the top of the vertical,\" she said, a reference to Medvedev's loss of influence since the end of presidency in 2012 and his loss of the prime minister's post in 2020.\n\nMedvedev once represented an influential faction in the constellation of competing groups that Putin uses to maintain power. But he has lost significant political weight over the years and some of his allies -- such as former Open Government Minister Mikhail Abyzov and the businessmen brothers Ziyavudin and Magomed Magomedov -- have ended up behind bars.\n\nMedvedev himself has fallen out of Putin's narrowing inner circle, now dominated by hawks with security-service backgrounds, in part due to the embarrassing allegations of corruption, analysts have said.\n\n'Fifth Column Of Traitors'\n\nAnd with the war in Ukraine clouding Russia's future, the atmosphere in the circles of power surrounding Putin may be tenser than ever.\n\nDenunciations and attacks on \"weak elements\" within the elite are on the rise \"and will become a big part of the dynamic,\" Snegovaya said, especially as the economy shrinks following the imposition of strict Western sanctions over the invasion.\n\nPutin has come out hard against any opposition to the war in Ukraine. In a chilling speech in mid-March, he asserted that there was a \"fifth column of national traitors\" inside the country and that Russians \"will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors.\"\n\nReports of senior Russian officials being put under house arrest have emerged in recent weeks following the initial failures in the war against Ukraine. Hard-line hawks within the elite may suspect Medvedev and his associates of not fully supporting the war, potentially making him an \"attractive\" target for attacks, Snegovaya said.\n\nArkady Dvorkovich, a former close adviser to Medvedev, was accused by a senior lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party of \"national betrayal\" last month after expressing concerns about the war and sympathy for civilians in Ukraine.\n\nDvorkovich soon stepped down as chairman of the Skolkovo Foundation, a technology hub located in Moscow region that emulates Silicon Valley and which Medvedev promoted on a trip to the United States during his presidency.\n\nRemember The 'Reset'?\n\nMedvedev, 56, has been one of Putin's most loyal allies over the past two decades. Putin tapped the former lawyer to succeed him as president in 2008 in order to avoid violating what was then a constitutional limit of two consecutive four-year terms.\n\nPutin's choice of Medvedev over fellow former KGB officer Sergei Ivanov \"signaled the possibility of a new, more liberal period in Russian politics, or so some hoped,\" Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow in 2012-14, wrote in his memoir, From Cold War To Hot Peace. Medvedev \"spoke a more sophisticated style of Russian than Putin, and seemed more orientated to, or at least familiar with, Western ideas,\" he wrote.\n\nMedvedev is not from the KGB and is a member of a generation of Russians who as a rule viewed the West and the collapse of the Soviet Union -- which came when he was in his 20s and Putin was almost 40 -- in a more positive light than their elders.\n\nIn a September 2009 article laying out his political vision, Medvedev described Russia's democracy as \"fragile\" and something that \"needs to be protected.\" He called for dialogue with civil society and touted changes he made to improve electoral competition. \"Putin had never said that,\" McFaul wrote.\n\nAs he was grooming his former campaign manager and fellow St. Petersburg native for the top job, Putin said that Medvedev could sometimes be tougher than him -- a remark that later seemed to presage Russia's invasion in Georgia in August 2008, three months after he took office.\n\nBut despite that move, Medvedev's presidency did seem to promise change, both at home and in ties with the West.\n\nHe pursued reforms at home and embraced President Barack Obama's \"reset\" of U.S.-Russia ties, signing the New START nuclear arms-reduction treaty with Obama in April 2010 and then smiling over cheeseburgers with him and enthusiastically taking in Silicon Valley during his U.S. visit that June.\n\nOn The Outside Looking In\n\nMedvedev's metamorphosis, if that is what it is, did not occur overnight. It slowly followed the sharp and steady souring of Russian-U.S. relations that can be traced to the end of 2011, when Putin accused the United States of fomenting protests over fraud-marred parliamentary elections and his decision -- announced by himself and Medvedev that September -- to return to the presidency in 2012.\n\nPutin swapped jobs with Medvedev, who remained in the No. 2 spot as prime minister until January 2020. Analysts said Putin replaced Medvedev as head of the government after he failed to deliver on the president's domestic priorities, including improving living standards.\n\nBut the shakeup also came as Putin was preparing constitutional amendments, adopted that July, that allow him to run for president again in 2024 and 2030, a move that seemed aimed to quash talk of a post-Putin Russia and ensure he could stay in power for years.\n\nPutin created a new role for Medvedev as deputy chairman of the Security Council, which is one of his main venues for decision-making on strategic issues but is a purely advisory body. Some analysts see the position as a sort of political retirement home for Medvedev. Putin is unlikely to \"put him in a position of trust anymore,\" Taylor said.\n\nMedvedev is among the top politicians least trusted by Russians, according to opinion polls, and Putin barred him from heading the United Russia party ticket for the September 2021 parliamentary elections.\n\nStarting around that time, Medvedev seems to have been seeking to step back into the spotlight with his acerbic, hawkish statements that are aligned with the rhetoric on state TV.\n\nThe new image as a brash Russian nationalist \"doesn't really fit him very well\" but may be part of a strategy to get back into a position of power at a later date, Taylor said.\n\n\"I think he -- maybe unrealistically -- still has political ambitions and doesn't know how the regime will shake out over the next few years, and he would rather be in power than out of power,\" he said. \"He may even still think that he could get the top job again.\"",

            "text": "Looking back at the past decade-and-a-half, we can see, with the benefit of hindsight, how the current aggression of Russia against Ukraine came to pass. It was enabled by the policies of the European neo-liberal elites.\n\nOn the day when Vladimir Putin decided to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he had no reason to fear any significant consequences from the West. For years, on many occasions and despite increasingly aggressive Russian behaviour he enjoyed gestures of support and friendship from the political leaders of countries such as Germany and France. It did not matter that he attacked Georgia, it did not matter when he annexed Crimea. It was still business as usual. So, why would he think that this time it would be any other way\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nGerhard Schr\u00f6der\n\nIn between the two long stretches of CDU rule (occasionally in coalition governments with the social democrats or the FDP liberals), there were several years during which Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (SPD \u2013 Social Democratic Party) was the chancellor. AndJust weeks before the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine he echoed Russia\u2019s rhetoric by saying on his podcast that Moscow had no interest in attacking Ukraine and felt alarmed by the accumulation of Nato troops in Eastern Europe.\u201cNato has not exactly been very restrained with exercises in the Baltic or Poland,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally, that has effects on Russia\u2019s thinking and threat assessment.\u201cI hope the sabre-rattling in Ukraine will be called off, because the things I\u2019m hearing from there, including finger-pointing at Germany because of its sensible refusal to export weapons \u2014 that really takes the biscuit.\u201dAlso in February 2022, he was nominated to join the board of directors at Gazprom.Talk about bad timing\u2026\n\nAngela Merkel\n\nAngela Merkel (CDU \u2013 Christian Democratic Union) has undoubtedly had a huge impact on the German and European political landscape, having served as the Chancellor of Germany for 16 years. The only person to serve longer than her was her fellow party member and mentor, Helmut Kohl, and he only served two weeks longer than her.Even though, a number of times, leaders of such countries as Poland and Ukraine warned her, that the project is intended to apply pressure on them by circumventing them as transit countries and denying them access to energy resources.And Merkel\u2019s cabinet would attempt to peddle a narrative according to which the pipelines would INCREASE the energy security of the region, since Germany would be able to resell Russian gas to them.But all this should not come as a surprise to anyone.At a 2007 meeting with Putin in Sochi, during her first term as Chancellor, she said \u201cthat Russia, when it was still the Soviet Union, was a very reliable supplier of energy resources for decades, and we would like this to continue.\u201dPerhaps Ms Merkel thought that by making Russia reliant on German money paid for natural gas, it is somehow possible to control Russia or at least prevent it from leading an imperialist policy. But this conviction soon fired back. Russia invaded Georgia the next year, and now, 15 years later,The Kremlin realises this very well, and possibly realised it back in 2007.To be fair to her, Angela Merkel did say in March 2014 that \u201cGermany will never accept the annexation of Crimea\u201d. But the lack of acceptance for the illegal annexation of the southern Ukrainian peninsula did not translate from words to deeds. Germany continued to make business deals with Russia. The decision to construct Nord Stream 2 was made just one year after the \u201cunacceptable\u201d annexation of Crimea.It seems that nothing Russia would do could serve as a wake-up call for Ms Merkel. Speaking in 2015, while she did concede that \u201cRussia has not made further progress in the past few years toward adopting many of the ideas that we share in the G7,\u201d she still hoped that Russia can be worked with to help provide for global security in what she termed \u201cNATO-Russia partnership\u201d.\u201cWe have the Normandy format for resolving the Ukraine crisis,\u201d she said. The Normandy format has clearly failed. She also said that \u201cRussia will and must also be included in efforts to resolve the Syrian civil war.\u201d Russia was backing the authoritarian regime of Bashar al-Assad in the conflict, yet Merkel stressed that \u201cit was only with the help of Russia that chemical weapons were removed from Syria,\u201d and so \u201cwe will also be discussing how Russia can be included.\u201d\n\nOlaf Scholz\n\nRestart, reset, engagement, dialogue, negotiations\u2026 They all come down to appeasement of a Putin dictatorship that has only become more hostile. Concessions to thugs and terrorists just encourage more aggression, as always. https://t.co/jFmtlZ0ozR \u2014 Garry Kasparov (@Kasparov63) January 3, 2022\n\nFor thirty years, Germans lectured Ukrainians about fascism. When fascism actually arrived, Germans funded it, and Ukrainians died fighting it. \u2014 Timothy Snyder (@TimothyDSnyder) April 20, 2022\n\nThe current Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz (SPD) has found himself in quite a conundrum. The Russian invasion of Ukraine began less than three months into his chancellorship. But he can hardly criticise Merkel\u2019s cabinet on its policy towards Russia.The current government is formed by a \u201cTraffic Lights Coalition\u201d (red for SPD, yellow for the liberal FDP, and green for\u2026 The Greens). And Olaf Scholz\u2019s Foreign Minister in the cabinet became the then co-leader of The Greens (in Germany, The Greens always make a point of electing two leaders, a woman and a man) Annalena Baerbock.Truly, keeping his own ministers in check must have been quite a toil for Mr Scholz, especially in a situation when interests of parties which may see eye-to-eye on some issues, but have radically different agenda\u2019s on others.In January, FM Baerbock also travelled to meet with her US counterpart, Antony Blinken, and the discussion about the threat posed by Russia was one of the topics of the talks., who Tweeted:Merely a week and a half before the war broke out, Chancellor Scholz still had hopes that the conflict could be avoided. \u201cThe diplomatic possibilities are far from being exhausted,\u201d Scholz said back then. He also praised the apparent withdrawal of the Russian troops from the border with Ukraine, following yet another unannounced \u201cmilitary manoeuvres.\u201dNow that the war has started, the Chancellor and his top diplomat are of one mind at least on one thing, and that is that Germany should not supply Ukraine with weapons, ostensibly because of Germany\u2019s troubled history with war.But when it comes to that, the outcome of such attitude has probably been best summarised by Timothy Snyder, an American historian specialising in the history of Central and Eastern Europe and especially the toll that totalitarian regimes took on the people of the region, who described the outcome of such policy in such blunt terms:Mr Snyder has written numerous books about the bloodied history of the countries wedged between Germany and Russia. He can most definitely write another historical opus about the events unfolding before our eyes, but for now, that Tweet offers a pretty decent summary of what German foreign policies in Central and Eastern Europe have brought about.A few weeks ago, the German government was ridiculed for offering to send Ukraine 5,000 helmets. The Germans stepped up their game a bit and offered to provide Ukraine with assistance in the form of other equipment. But when Ukrainians presented them with a list of the necessary material, the Germans struck out any requested heavy military equipment from it, such as e.g. Leopard tanks.\n\nWhat Chancellor Scholz offered instead, was that Germany will send to Ukraine its Soviet-era equipment, that the Federal Republic of Germany inherited from the People\u2019s Army of the communist German Democratic Republic (East Germany) upon German re-unification.\n\n\n\nThe excuses for that were several, one of them being that it would diminish Germany\u2019s own defensive capabilities. And that in spite of the fact that the German military industry is perfectly well capable of manufacturing enough equipment to provide for the defensive needs of Germany and more.\n\n\n\nMany countries of the former Eastern Bloc have offered to send Ukraine their Warsaw-Pact-era equipment. The difference here is that in the case of countries such as Czechia or Poland, this equipment has been conserved to be serviceable until very recently, while their militaries were updating their weaponry to the modern western-manufactured arsenal. Whether post-Soviet equipment that would be sent by Germany is at all serviceable after spending over 30 years rotting away in warehouses is dubious at best.\n\nDonald Tusk elected head of EPP The President of the European Council and former Polish PM Donald Tusk has been elected unopposed as leader of the European People\u2019s Party (EPP) at... see more\n\nDonald Tusk\n\nThe two existing strings of the Yamal gas pipeline. Photo: Wikimedia Commons/Samuel Bailey\n\nThe former Prime Minister of Poland and once-President of the European Council said in a recent interview given to the Polish weekly \u201cPolityka\u201d, that in Brussels, he had an opinion of a Russophobe, almost monomaniacally pre-occupied with Ukraine. But for those who have an attention span longer than the four-year electoral cycle, it is not exactly the way they may remember his behaviour or his policies towards Russia prior to the annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbas in 2014 (Mr Tusk was elected the President of the EC later that year).Mr Tusk became the Prime Minister of Poland after the snap election in 2007. But Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, who ran on the Law and Justice party ticket, remained the President of Poland. This led to a conflict between the offices of the PM, now Mr Tusk, and President Kaczy\u0144ski.Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, as well as his twin brother Jaros\u0142aw (who has served and continues to serve as the head of the Law and Justice party), have always remained wary of Russian imperial ambitions, seeking closer ties with the US as the largest NATO country and the best guarantor of Poland\u2019s security. There were even plans to construct elements of a US-backed anti-missile shield in Poland to increase its defensive capabilities.These plans were cancelled following the 2007 elections to avoid tensions with Russia.According to him, \u201cthe lack of dialogue serves neither Poland nor Russia. It is bad for the interests of both countries on the international arena,\u201d adding that \u201cthe time for a change in the matter [of Polish-Russian relations] is now,\u201d and that, according to him \u201csignals from our eastern neighbour confirm that they are also maturing to reach that conclusion.\u201dThroughout most of his tenure as PM, the Tusk cabinet attempted to distance itself from the US and tie Poland closer to Brussels, including by maintaining good relations with Berlin. Berlin and the Merkel government have, as previously demonstrated, done their best to maintain good relations with Russia at any cost, and the then Polish government attempted to do the same.When in 2008 Russian forces invaded the Caucasian country of Georgia, ostensibly to protect the people of the autonomous region of South Ossetia (which after Russian victory in the war was transformed into an internationally unrecognised breakaway republic under Russian protectorate \u2013 some of our observant readers may notice a pattern there\u2026), President Kaczy\u0144ski, along with the heads of state of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia visited the beleaguered Georgia and during a rally in the country\u2019s capital of Tbilisi addressed the crowds with words that now seem prophetic:The fact that the President was conducting his own foreign policy, independent of the Prime Minister, was not well received. PM Tusk and his cabinet have been trying to pursue a policy of rapprochement with the Kremlin, and President Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s visit did not help in achieving that goal., during what was to be a visit to the Katyn Memorial, where thousands of Polish officers murdered by the Soviet NKVD are buried. There were no survivors.The catastrophe immediately sparked accusations from Law and Justice politicians and supporters against the Kremlin, accusing Putin of orchestrating an assassination of the Polish President and his entourage. Several factors were of particular concern, e.g. aeroplane was of Soviet manufacture and as such, it was serviced in Russia. To exacerbate the matter the Polish government led by Donald Tusk relinquished the investigation to the Russian side, even though it could pursue an international investigation into the crash, which sparked accusations of at best gross negligence, and at worst collusion. The Russians refused to release the wreck of the aeroplane, leaving it to be exposed to the elements and eaten away by rust on the Smolensk airfield.But in Poland, the matter of who is responsible for the death of the President and the rest of the Polish delegation only fueled the polarisation of the political scene., and even mocked those who entertained the idea.Nine years after it was proposed, and six years after the construction beganMoreover, there were plans to sign a long-term contract for the supply of Russian natural gas via the Yamal pipeline until 2037, and securing Russian transit rights through Poland for supplying Europe with natural gas until 2045.\n\nSince the pipeline splits into two branches in Belarus, whose dictator, Alyaksandr Lukashenka is Putin\u2019s vassal, and one of the branches circumvents the territory of Poland, and the other the territory of Ukraine, each of the countries could at any time see its natural gas supply cut off entirely. The construction of Nord Stream and the abandonment of plans to diversify the Polish gas supply would put Poland and Ukraine entirely at Putin\u2019s mercy.\n\n\n\nIf Mr Tusk did indeed have an opinion of a Russophobe among other European politicians in Brussels, then it really tells us more about the state of mind of those politicians. If Poland\u2019s Deputy PM Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, who continues to maintain that Putin had his brother murdered, or Mr Donald Tusk, who completely dismissed the idea, are both Russophobes, then perhaps \u201cRussophobe\u201d is simply another word Brussels politicians use for \u201ca person from a country which had the misfortune to border Russia for centuries\u201d.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt\n\nGuy Verhofstadt is a liberal Flemish-Belgian politician, former Belgian MP, minister and Prime Minister, and currently an MEP and the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe faction in the European Parliament, in which position he has served since 2009.He is a strong advocate of a tighter European integration in the form of transforming the European Union into a federal entity, \u201cThe United States of Europe\u201d, which is also the title of a book he published in 2005.Back in 2002, following the shock of the 9/11 attacks, Mr Verhofstadt, who was then the Belgian PM, went even further. During a meeting of the Russia-NATO Council, which was meant to bring the alliance and Russia closer in terms of co-operating on global security, he said that:Any gains in those terms that Russia had made since the fall of communism have obviously been erased during the past 20 years of Putin\u2019s rule, and when it comes to global security, Russia has served as a destabilising factor. Not only when it invaded Georgia and now Ukraine, but also through its involvement in Mali and elsewhere.Mr Verhofstadt is one of those European politicians who have visited Ukraine in recent weeks and was abhorred by the evidence of atrocities perpetrated in places such as Borodyanka by the Russian invasion troops. To his credit, for the last several years he has been highly critical of European politicians who maintain a relationship with Russian politicians connected to the Kremlin. Justly so.The problem is that Mr Verhofstadt is linking anyone who disagrees with his liberal agenda, that is anyone who can be considered even remotely conservative, to Putin. For him, every conservative is just as bad as a dictator of a country that exercises practically full control of the media, imprisons or even murders political opponents, orders the invasion of neighbouring countries, and has his soldiers perpetrate genocide and other war crimes. Such a skewed perspective is not much different from accusing anyone with slightly different political views of being a re-incarnation of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, etc.And while it is true that several leaders of European conservative or right-wing movements have indeed fallen for the Kremlin peddled narrative portraying Putin\u2019s regime as one standing up to the \u201crotten, liberal West\u201d, even the current savage aggression perpetrated by Russia against Ukraine not quite making them rethink their attitude, some accusations are more hit-and-miss.\n\nFor example, Guy Verhofstadt has been an extremely vocal critic of the current Polish government. He was very critical of the \u201cWarsaw Summit\u201d, a conference of conservative and right- and centre-right-wing party leaders that occurred in Warsaw in December 2021, that was organised by the Polish ruling United Right coalition.\n\n\n\nIn a Tweet written in Polish, he referred to a very controversial comment made by Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French right-wing National Rally party. Her comment dated extremely poorly over the past several months, that is quite clear. But when Mr. Verhofstadt writes that \u201cOnly Putin and zero Europe\u2026 Law and Justice brings Poland closer to their national nightmare\u2026 in the name of blind party ambitions!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTylko Putin i zero Europy\u2026\n\n\n\nPiS przybli\u017ca Polsk\u0119 coraz bardziej do ich narodowego koszmaru\u2026 wszystko w imi\u0119 \u015blepych ambicji partyjnych ! https://t.co/h3JOAUKDnj \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) December 6, 2021\n\nWell\u2026 Ms Le Pen\u2019s comments, as already said, dated extremely poorly. The Hungarian PM, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, was also present at the summit, and his reluctance to give up cheap Russian crude oil and natural gas in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has met with harsh criticism from the Polish government, making the regional co-operation within the V4 group (made up of Poland, Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia) extremely hard.\n\n\n\nBut accusing the Polish conservatives of being Putin\u2019s supporters? People that believe that the Kremlin is responsible for the death of a Polish president from their own party?\n\n\n\nIt seems that according to Mr Verhofstadt\u2019s logic, the Polish government is some strange animal, in the vein of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat. It somehow manages to be anti-Russian and pro-Putin at the same time.\n\n\n\nAnd of course, any chance to lambast conservatives is a good one... So Guy Verhofstadt throws muck at conservative and right-wing politicians, and hopes something will stick. But he should be more careful when using photos of European politicians being chummy with Putin, because there are many European politicians that over the years have shaken Putin\u2019s hand. Including Mr Verhofstadt himself.\n\nWhen Europe is under threat, always remember:\n\n\n\nThose who talk about our sovereignty are always the first the sell it off ! pic.twitter.com/YqWxcPxqqH \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) February 22, 2022\n\nEmmanuel Macron\n\nCompared to other old hands listed so far, the President of the French Republic is relatively new to politics. His career only really began when he worked for one of the agencies of the Ministry of Finance in 2004 and served as an adviser to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande since 2006. But the only post he was ever elected to was that of the president, in 2017.Mr Macron\u2019s relationship with Putin is a complicated one. To his credit,He has also ordered airstrikes against Russian-backed Syrian government forces.His opinion on the subject may have evolved since then.he said in November 2019 in an interview given to The Independent. NATO Secretary-General and even Mr Macron\u2019s close ally, Chancellor Merkel, were shocked by the assessment, the latter even calling Macron\u2019s statement \u201cdrastic words\u201d. This was in contrast to the reaction of the Kremlin. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson called them \u201ctruthful words\u201d.And perhaps most controversially, he defended the selling of French-manufactured weapons to Russia, which occurred between 2014 and 2020, so after the illegal annexation of Crimea. While it is true that the decision was originally made by the Hollande administration, President Macron did not immediately put a stop to the arms trade.It seems that the ability to freely trade with Russia is very important to the French leader.The fact that many countries are not comfortable with Russia due to its aggressive policies appears to have eluded him. The fact that France, positioned on the other side of Europe and far away from Russia, may have been a contributing factor.Back in the day he said that the sanctions were inefficient, and that they \u201chave changed absolutely nothing in Russia \u2014 I am not proposing at all to lift them, I am just stating this.\u201d Well, that much has definitely proven true. The question is whether the correct course of action would not have been applying more sanctions, something that European countries were in the end forced to do, but it is happening only now, after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Macron has made numerous phone calls to Putin following the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian hostilities to a full-scale invasion. His frequent contacts with Putin and attempts at diplomacy have even invited mockery. Macron\u2019s attempts to broker peace have also been criticised by some politicians, including the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki who, when commenting on the French President for his efforts, asked whether he would also negotiate with Hitler. This prompted the French head of state to lash out against the Polish PM, not only accusing him of trying to interfere in French elections on behalf of Marine Le Pen, but also of being an antisemite and homophobe.\n\n\n\nAccording to President Macron, following the revelation of war crimes perpetrated on Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and its vicinity, he is no longer in direct contact with Vladimir Putin. He has also joined the calls for an embargo on Russian crude oil, although, notably, not on natural gas. But just as the call for an embargo on one strategic energy resource the sale of which is filling the Kremlin\u2019s coffers is blunted by the refusal to give up another one, he has been rather coy when it comes to calling a spade a spade.\n\n\u201cSo far, it has been established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and bring them to justice,\u201d Macron said during an interview given to France 2 television channel on April 13. As he said \u201cI am very careful with some terms [genocide] these days,\u201d he added. \u201cI'm not sure the escalation of words is helping the cause right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nFortunately for Mr Macron, who is running for re-election (the second round of the French presidential election will take place on April 24), his reluctance to call the genocide Russians are perpetrating against Ukrainians a genocide is still probably not as jarring as Ms Le Pen\u2019s statements about Crimea belonging within the Russian sphere of influence.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy\n\nsource: TVP World\n\nAnd finally, on a brief note, the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Sarkozy was one of the western leaders who helped negotiate a cease-fire during the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008 (officially: \u201cpeace enforcement\u201d). The Kremlin agreed to halt its invasion of its southern neighbour, once they have achieved their military goals, that is the conquest of South Ossetia. So perhaps giving Sarkozy too much credit for his role in the cessation of hostilities would be a bit of a stretch.But the issue is not Mr Sarkozy\u2019s role in brokering a cease-fire, but rather what followed.In a speech on April 3, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited Mr Sarkozy (as well as Angela Merkel) to visit Bucha, the site of the Russian-perpetrated massacre. He said that while he does not blame anyone except Russia for the aggression on Ukraine, he insisted the two former leaders \u201csee tortured Ukrainians with their own eyes\u201d, so that they can understand what the concession policy to Russia has led to 14 years later.",

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The Russians hadn\u2019t taken into account the railway saboteurs of Belarus. Starting in the earliest days of the invasion in February, a clandestine network of railway workers, hackers and dissident security forces went into action to disable or disrupt the railway links connecting Russia to Ukraine through Belarus, wreaking havoc on Russian supply lines.\n\nThe attacks have drawn little attention outside Belarus amid the drama of the Russian onslaught and the bloody aftermath of Russia\u2019s humiliating retreat. Fierce Ukrainian resistance and tactical errors by an ill-prepared Russian force were likely enough to thwart Russia\u2019s plans, analysts say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Belarus railway saboteurs can at least claim a role in fueling the logistical chaos that quickly engulfed the Russians, leaving troops stranded on the front lines without food, fuel and ammunition within days of the invasion.\n\nAlexander Kamyshin, head of Ukrainian railways, expressed Ukraine\u2019s gratitude to the Belarusian saboteurs. \u201cThey are brave and honest people who have helped us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe attacks were simple but effective, targeting the signal control cabinets essential to the functioning of the railways, members of the activist network said. For days on end, the movement of trains was paralyzed, forcing the Russians to attempt to resupply their troops by road and contributing to the snarl-up that stalled the infamous 40-mile military convoy north of Kyiv.\n\nHow much of the chaos can be attributed to the sabotage and how much to poor logistical planning by the Russians is hard to tell, especially as there is no independent media reporting from Belarus, said Emily Ferris, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. But without automated signaling, trains were forced to slow to a crawl and the number of them traveling on the tracks at any one time would have been severely restricted, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGiven the Russian reliance on trains, I\u2019m sure it contributed to some of the problems they had in the north. It would have slowed down their ability to move,\u201d she said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t push further into Ukrainian territory and snarled their supply lines because they had to rely on trucks.\u201d\n\nThe attacks also bought time for Ukrainian troops to formulate an effective response to the Russian invasion, said Yury Ravavoi, a Belarusian activist and trade unionist who escaped to Poland under threat of arrest during the anti-government protests that rocked Belarus in 2020.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say we were the most important factor, but we were an important brick in the wall,\u201d he said.\n\nThe saboteurs drew inspiration from an earlier episode in Belarusian history, during World War II, when Belarusians opposed to the Nazi occupation blew up railway lines and train stations to disrupt German supply lines. The Rail War, as it is known, is venerated as a moment of triumph for Belarus, taught in schools as the most successful of the tactics deployed by resistance fighters that eased the way for Soviet troops to drive the Germans out.\n\nThe battle for control over eastern and southern Ukrainian cities is the latest stage in this war, as Russia attempts to solidify its grip on the Black Sea. (Video: Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)\n\nEight decades later, it is Russia\u2019s presence in Belarus that has stirred dissent. The deployment of tens of thousands of Russian troops in Belarus in preparation for the invasion of Ukraine triggered widespread domestic opposition and rekindled opposition networks formed during the 2020 protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said Hanna Liubakova, a Belarusian journalist living in exile in Lithuania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis second Rail War has taken a more benign form than its predecessor. The partisans were keen not to inflict casualties, Ravavoi said. So they focused their attacks on damaging equipment to stop the railways from functioning.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to kill any Russian army or Belarusian train drivers. We used a peaceful way to stop them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe and other Belarusians involved in organizing the attacks decline to reveal precise details of how the attacks were carried out and by whom, citing the need for secrecy and concerns for the safety of the railway partisans, as the saboteurs are loosely known.\n\nThree main groups have been involved, representing railway workers, security force defectors and cyber specialists, said Lt. Col Alexander Azarov, a former security official living in Warsaw who heads the security force group called Bypol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRailway employees sympathetic to the partisans have leaked details of Russian movements and the locations of key railway infrastructure to a group called the Community of Railway Workers, which shares them on Telegram channels. Supporters on the ground link up to carry out the attacks, but there is no formal chain of command, Azarov said.\n\n\u201cOur movement is not centralized,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a leader of the resistance. It\u2019s horizontal, with dozens of groups working on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe third group, the Cyber Partisans, is formed of exiled Belarusian IT professionals who have carried out several cyberattacks on the Belarusian government since joining in 2020.\n\nThe Cyber Partisans launched the first attack, hacking into the railway\u2019s computer network in the days leading up to the invasion and snarling rail traffic before Russian troops had even crossed the border. Infiltrating the railway network\u2019s computers was relatively easy, said Yuliana Shemetovets, a spokesperson for the group who is based in New York, because the railway company is still using Windows XP, an outdated version of the software that contains many vulnerabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting on Feb. 26, two days after the invasion began, a succession of five sabotage attacks against signaling cabinets brought train traffic to an almost complete halt, said Sergey Voitekhovich, a former railway employee now based in Poland who is a leader in the Community of Railway Workers.\n\nBy Feb. 28, satellite photographs began to appear of the 40-mile convoy of Russian trucks and tanks ostensibly headed from Belarus toward Kyiv. Within a week, the convoy had completely stalled as vehicles ran out of fuel or broke down.\n\nThe Belarusian authorities have since launched an intense effort to prevent attacks and hunt down the saboteurs. The Interior Ministry has decreed that damaging railway infrastructure is an act of terrorism, a crime that carries a 20-year prison term.\n\nDozens of railway workers have been randomly detained and their phones searched for evidence that they were in touch with the partisans, the activists say. At least 11 Belarusians are in custody, accused of participating in the attacks, according to human rights groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early April, security police captured three alleged saboteurs near the town of Bobruisk and shot them in the knees. State television broadcast footage of the bleeding men, their knees bandaged, and claimed they had been shot while resisting arrest.\n\nThe shootings have had a chilling effect on the saboteur network, Azarov said. Belarusian troops are patrolling and drones have been deployed to monitor the railway lines. \u201cIt has become too dangerous to do attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nBut by the time of the police shooting, Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the area around Kyiv was in full swing and the Kremlin had announced it would refocus its military effort on capturing the east of Ukraine. The majority of the Russian troops that entered Ukraine from Belarus are now in the process of being redeployed to the east, the Pentagon says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe believe the fact that the Russians gave up on taking Kyiv is a result of our work because the Russians didn\u2019t feel as safe in Belarus as they had expected,\u201d said Franak Viacorka, spokesman for Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. \u201cThousands of Russian troops didn\u2019t receive food, they didn\u2019t receive fuel, and they didn\u2019t receive equipment on time.\u201d\n\nNow, a new phase in the rail war may be underway. In recent days the railway activists have posted on Telegram photographs of damage to signaling cabinets along Russian railway lines being used to transport troops into eastern Ukraine. The attacks can\u2019t be independently confirmed, but Voitekhovich claimed members of his railway network are involved. \u201cThere are open borders between Belarus and Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "4/24/2022\n\ntags: foreign policy\n\nDaniel Herman is Professor of American History at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington. He is the author of three monographs including Hell on the Range: A Story of Honor, Conscience, and the American West (2010) and the novel The Feudist (2020).\n\nUS Senator John McCain speaks to a pro-EU crowd in Kyiv, December 2013.\n\nThis past March, three esteemed colleagues at Central Washington University convened a teach-in to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine (they convened another one in April, which I didn\u2019t attend and so won\u2019t talk about). The presenters\u2014all experts in the fields of Russian history and culture\u2014gave bravura expositions exploring Russian nationalism, empire building, war, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. To my mind, however, something was missing: dissent.\n\nThough effective in its aims\u2014to teach history and generate support (including money) for Ukraine\u2014this particular teach-in differed profoundly from civil disobedience campaigns of the Vietnam era. Those who participated in the original anti-war teach-ins of the 1960s stood the risk of being ridiculed, bombed, spied on by FBI agents, and excoriated by community authorities and administrators. The CWU presenters, by contrast, buttressed rather than challenged a dominant narrative, given that 70% of Americans already view Russia as a threat. If the presenters are critical of hawkish U.S. foreign policy and the decades-long expansion of the military-industrial complex, not to mention the role of the U.S. in heightening tensions in Ukraine, they didn\u2019t say so.\n\nI find this particularly troubling at a time when 45% of Americans\u2014and 81% of Republicans\u2014view President Biden\u2019s actions viz. Ukraine as too cautious; 46% support a U.S.-imposed no-fly zone even when told it would risk nuclear war; and Congressional Democrats (Democrats!) seek to add billions more to the already record military budget that the administration requests.\n\nI\u2019m no expert on the history of Russia or Ukraine, but I am an avid consumer of news and I know quite a bit about U.S. history, including the history of U.S. wars and public opinion. In the spirit of scholarly debate\u2014and with respect and admiration for the presenters\u2014I take it upon myself to offer a dissenting view.\n\nHad I been among the presenters, I would have asserted that the overwhelming American support for Ukrainians in their fight against Russia\u2014though not without justice\u2014resembles earlier moments of American solidarity with European nations fighting authoritarianism, particularly 1917, when the U.S., reacting to German attacks and atrocities (but ignorant of British atrocities) joined the Entente Powers in what President Wilson called \u201ca war for democracy.\u201d Though the U.S. helped defeat autocratic Germany, the war spawned persecutions, authoritarianism, and jingoism at home (not least among Democrats, particularly intellectuals) and\u2014due to the terms of the Versailles Treaty\u2014fueled the rise of Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn that 1917 moment, like this one, a bellicose press\u2014with assistance from a bellicose government\u2014shut down dissent and marginalized dissenters. Randolph Bourne\u2019s justly famous essay condemning war fever seems every bit as apropos as it was in 1917.\n\nI do not doubt that Putin (rather like Germany\u2019s Kaiser) is a would-be imperialist who holds nostalgia for the Soviet Union and/or \u201cGreater Russia,\u201d and would like to recreate one or both, albeit without communism. The probability of that happening, however, seems exceedingly low. Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin had said that those who wish to recreate the Soviet Union \u201chave no brain\u201d and that his conventional military can in no way match that of NATO. More to the point, recreating the Soviet Union or Greater Russia would be enormously expensive and almost certainly impossible, no matter the outcome in Ukraine (part of why the Soviet Union dissolved was because the empire was more encumbrance than asset).\n\nMy own take is that the Western media\u2019s anti-Putin, pro-Ukraine, pro-NATO barrage has blinded both Americans and Europeans (especially the British, those hoary players of the \u201cGreat Game\u201d) to the fact that Putin, though capable of great brutality, is a rational actor. He is as likely to consolidate power due to the West\u2019s fervent response as to lose it. By making a diplomatic solution almost impossible (politicians need public support for any offer to lift sanctions as part of a peace package), the West\u2019s fervency might well protract the killing for years and destabilize Eastern Europe.\n\nLet me start my more detailed discussion by talking about NATO expansion. One of the teach-in presenters acknowledged that the U.S. and its European allies may have made a mistake by expanding NATO into nations that comprised the old Soviet Union but added that \u201cwoulda/couldas\u201d of past policymaking are beside the point. I disagree passionately. Revisiting \u201cwoulda/couldas\u201d is probably the only thing that can bring peace, at least any time in the near future.\n\nI have no particular expertise in foreign policy, but I defer to those who do (or did before their decease): George Kennan, the doyen of American Cold War policy; Paul Nitze, Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan; Paul Warnke, director of the Arms Control Association and SALT II negotiator; Richard Pipes, noted historian of the Soviet Union; Gary Hart, former Colorado Senator and co\u2011chair of the U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century; Jack Matlock, President Reagan\u2019s ambassador to the Soviet Union; Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State under Richard Nixon; William Perry, Secretary of Defense to Bill Clinton; and Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense under George Bush and Barack Obama. All of them\u2014and many others\u2014feared that NATO expansion into the former Soviet Union would lead to a renewed Cold War, if not a hot one.\n\nKennan\u2019s words are particularly apropos. The NATO expanders, he argued, had \u201clittle understanding of Russian history and Soviet history. Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then [the NATO expanders] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cI think it is the beginning of a new cold war \u2026 I think it is a tragic mistake.\u201d\n\nIn their zeal to punch Vladimir Putin, modern Democrats and their preferred media voices are quick to dismiss or diminish the assertion that the U.S. played a significant role in provoking the war (this isn\u2019t the Democratic Party of the 1970s or even the early 2000s; it\u2019s a party dedicated, or at least inured, to regime change policies, not just for Russia, but also Syria, Libya, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, Bolivia, and others to be announced). But yes, alas, the U.S. and NATO did much to provoke the war, and not just by expanding NATO. The U.S. also provoked the war with its own election meddling in Eastern Europe, especially in Ukraine, a meddling that was magnitudes\u2014light years\u2014greater than whatever Russia did or did not do in our 2016 election.\n\nSomething I have not seen reported in any mainstream venue is that as late as 2008, fully 50% of Ukrainians opposed NATO membership versus 24.3% who supported it. Another 2008 poll showed even greater opposition (56% against joining NATO versus 15% for). In a 2010 Gallup poll, 40% of Ukrainians viewed NATO as more threat than protector (just 17% said the opposite). What those poll numbers suggest is that the current situation resulted not from timeless Ukrainian fears of Russian aggression, but from blundering, arrogant neo-conservative Western foreign policy, along with equally blundering and over-aggressive Russian and Ukrainian policies since 2008.\n\nPolicy blunders, to be sure, weren\u2019t the only mover of opinion. Both the U.S. and EU offered powerful economic incentives. Quite simply, the EU and US are vastly wealthier than Russia and can offer enormous loans, bailouts, and investment capital. The fact that Russia has been Ukraine\u2019s main export partner, however, equalizes the equation to a degree.\n\nIf free market economics alone are driving Ukraine\u2019s movement toward the West, Russia should stand out of the way. The West, however, has not let the invisible hand do all the work. It also deploys another, more visible\u2014more problematic\u2014hand: the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), an agency created under President Reagan to perform tasks once under the purview of the CIA, including \u201cfostering \u2026 political parties, trade unions, free markets and business organizations.\u201d As idealistic and non-controversial as those goals sound, NED has a long history of promoting regime change; one observer calls it the National Endowment (for Meddling) in Democracy. In Ukraine, NED has poured tens of millions of dollars into building a pro-Western constituency. NED\u2019s European cousin, the European Endowment for the Democracy, has done the same on a smaller scale. They are assisted by the West\u2019s lavishly funded NGO complex, which (like NED) extended its reach across Eastern Europe. Total U.S. investment in Ukrainian \u201cgood governance\u201d and \u201cother goals,\u201d averred former Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland (now Undersecretary of State), amounted to $5 billion between 1991 and 2013.\n\nLet\u2019s step back a moment and imagine that Russia was an economic juggernaut able to spend $5 billion to turn Mexico into a close ally, modernize its army. Imagine, moreover, that Russia proposed to station troops\u2014along with anti-ballistic missiles\u2014in Mexico after bringing it into a defensive alliance (which is what NATO has done in nations formerly allied with Russia). Imagine, moreover, that Mexico was receptive to Russia\u2019s money\u2014and welcomed its meddling\u2014because it was poor and because some of its citizens, but not a majority, had lingering fears of U.S. hostility. Keep in mind that the U.S. has invaded Mexico twice, though not recently. That is precisely what the United States and its NATO allies have done in Ukraine.\n\nOne can certainly reply that Western meddling is necessary to counter Russian meddling. Russia clearly supports Ukrainian parties and leaders that favor its interests. No doubt it has brought tremendous pressure to bear on Ukrainian governments. I reiterate, however, that, as late as 2010, Ukrainians didn\u2019t want to join NATO. It was the West that had to lobby Ukrainians to gain support.\n\nThe NED/NGO complex is obviously not the only reason that Ukrainians have increasingly favored entering NATO and the EU. There is also the matter of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for the breakaway states in the Donbas (including sending a small number of troops), which occurred in reaction to Ukraine\u2019s Maidan revolution in 2014. The effect of Russia\u2019s decision was to strengthen Ukrainian nationalism and support for NATO, partly due to Russia\u2019s straightforward aggression, and partly because the withdrawal of Crimea and the Donbas greatly diminished Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian electorate.[1]\n\nGiven that Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea and Donbas created a predictable Ukrainian backlash, why did Russia take them? What we mostly hear from the cable press\u2014whether Fox, MSNBC, or CNN\u2014is that Putin\u2019s Russia is an imperialist, hateful, lying nation guided by the idea that might makes right. The Maidan revolution and its aftermath, however, is complex and ambiguous.\n\nTo understand that revolution\u2014or coup, by some accounts\u2014we have to go back to 2008, when George W. Bush, along with NATO, declared that Ukraine and Georgia would both become NATO members. Russia\u2014which had been warning against NATO expansion even before the first wave in 1999\u2014threatened war if that happened. From the Russian point of view, NATO wasn\u2019t an innocent, defensive alliance, but an aggressive, pro-Western alliance seeking to encircle them, isolate them economically, and, ultimately, strangle them militarily. In his speech justifying the Ukraine invasion, Putin discussed the threat of NATO encirclement in his first substantive paragraph and mentioned NATO nine more times. It is certainly possible that Putin invoked the NATO threat in an effort to disguise ulterior motives (e.g., recreating the Soviet Union), but to make that assumption is to overlook longstanding Russian fears.\n\nThe fact that NATO placed a \u201cdefensive\u201d shield of anti-ballistic missiles in former Warsaw Pact nations\u2014ostensibly to shoot down nuclear weapons launched by Iran\u2014was particularly anathema to Russia. From the Russian point of view, the West sought to give itself impunity to launch a nuclear attack without Russia being able to retaliate (since its missiles would be shot down). This would give the West so-called \u201cfirst-strike capability.\u201d The fact that the U.S. proceeded to withdraw from one arms-control treaty after another\u2014ABM, the INF, the Open Skies Treaty\u2014only intensified Russian fears (to be fair, the U.S. and NATO have accused Russians of any number of treaty violations; this is not simply a \u201cWest is malicious\u201d scenario, nor is it simply a \u201cRussia is malicious\u201d scenario).\n\nThe latter two treaty withdrawals, incidentally, were decisions by Putin\u2019s ostensible best friend, Donald Trump, who was also the first president to send \u201clethal aid\u201d (mostly meaning Javelin anti-tank missiles) to Ukraine, thus overturning Obama\u2019s decision not to do so for fear of worsening tensions and arming neo-Nazi \u201cthugs.\u201d Trump, too\u2014contrary to popular perceptions\u2014ramped up economic sanctions beyond Congressional mandates, causing Putin to believe that the West was waging economic war. Whether those sanctions were justified is a question I\u2019ll put aside for now; what is likely, however, is that they did more harm than good.\n\nWe can argue about whether Russian leaders are/were irrational to think that the West is out to get them, but it\u2019s unquestionably true that\u2019s what many of them thought and continue to think. Those fears led Russia to develop hypersonic nuclear-tipped missiles that the West thus far cannot defend against. They also led Russia to attack Georgia in 2008 in a five-day war initiated by Georgia\u2019s illegal attempt to reclaim a breakaway region called South Ossetia. This is a war that Russia\u2019s detractors cite as evidence that Putin is ruthless and seeks to recreate the Soviet Union. The actuality was a great deal more complex, and did not end with Russia annexing Georgia (though it continues to pose a military threat to Georgia).\n\nNor will Russia annex Ukraine, despite what we hear in the media. Its troops aren\u2019t positioned to capture the whole of Ukraine, much less occupy it. The objective seems to be to destroy Ukraine\u2019s military capabilities and to carve off a part of eastern Ukraine in order to attach Crimea to Russia by land and to better defend the Donbas. One would never know this from watching CNN, but, according to U.S. military and intelligence officials, Russian forces\u2014despite inflicting enormous carnage\u2014have been deliberately restrained in order to give room for diplomacy. The other objective seems to be precisely what Putin has stated: to ensure that Ukraine does not become a member of NATO. Nor am I willing to entirely discredit Putin\u2019s statement that he seeks to \u201cde-Nazify\u201d Ukraine (more on that later), given the Azov Battalion\u2019s role in attacks on the Donbas.\n\nStill, as my colleagues insist, this is Putin\u2019s war. He made an illegal decision to invade a sovereign nation. He and his supporters deserve whatever they get. Yes, but no, that\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nEven in the early 2000s, the NED/NGO complex had gone to work to turn Ukraine into a pro-Western nation. After NATO\u2019s decision in 2008 to encourage Ukraine\u2019s admission (I say \u201cencourage admission\u201d because, to reiterate, Ukrainians themselves opposed it), the fight for Ukrainian hearts and minds became more fraught, with pro-Western forces competing against Russophones to elect a favorable government. This was an inherently destabilizing situation.\n\nA turning point came in 2010, when Ukraine elected Viktor Yanukovych as president. Though considered pro-Russian, he strongly favored integrating Ukraine\u2019s economy with the European Union, partly by negotiating an EU economic bailout package. In 2013, however, he turned down the EU\u2019s offer because it required austerity measures that would shred Ukraine\u2019s social safety net and, arguably, because it contained strict anti-corruption requirements (Ukraine is awash in corruption). When Russia offered its own bailout deal sans austerity and anti-corruption measures and with guaranteed access to cheap natural gas, Yanukovych accepted, triggering his right-wing opponents to accuse him of making secret concessions (presumably involving control of Ukraine\u2019s gas pipelines).\n\nWhat often got lost in coverage of the ensuing protests was that Yanukovych\u2019s Russia deal protected industrial jobs in Ukraine\u2019s eastern \u201cRust Belt\u201d that might well disappear under the EU package. Nor did Western coverage give much attention to Russia\u2019s fears that cheap EU imports would undermine its fragile economy. Not surprisingly, the strongly pro-free enterprise NED/NGO complex went to work to undermine Yanukovych by working closely with the leaders of the Maidan revolution.\n\nThe U.S. and its NED/NGO apparatus did not create the Maidan phenomenon, to be sure, but did steer it to their own ends. Multiple U.S. officials\u2014including Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and Republican John McCain\u2014met with members of the far-right Svoboda party to affirm their support for Maidan. The equivalent would be Russian leaders meeting directly with, say, January 6 insurrectionaries. The staunchly neoconservative Assistant Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, moreover, called Geoffrey Pyatt, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine to instruct him about which Ukrainians the U.S. wanted in President Yanukovych\u2019s ministry and which ones the U.S. wanted excluded. Nuland in particular recommended Arseniy Yatsenyuk (\u201cYats is the guy who\u2019s got the economic experience,\u201d she says in the leaked audio of the call). After Maidan forces forced Yanukovych to flee the country (even after he had called new elections), Yatsenyuk became president. In a space of five months, Yatsenyuk nixed the Russia bailout deal, resuscitated the EU package (including austerity), and resigned.\n\nDid Maidan amount to a U.S.-endorsed coup? Was Nuland promoting Yatsenyuk for the role of president? We\u2019re told that the idea that the U.S. supported a coup in Ukraine is Russian disinformation, but are we sure? What precisely did Geoffrey Pyatt mean by \u201c[we need] somebody with an international personality to come out here and help to midwife this thing.\u201d Did Pyatt require a high-profile Western leader to visit Ukraine merely to endorse a ministerial shuffle? Or was the U.S. playing a bigger game? At the very least, the U.S. was meddling in Ukraine\u2019s politics to impose its will.\n\nIn supporting the Maidan project, the U.S. found a ready ally not just in the professorial accountant, Yatsenyuk, but also in Ukraine\u2019s energetic far-right, which provided shock troops\u2014militants\u2014in the protests in Kyiv and elsewhere. After those protests succeeded, the new government repealed a law allowing Russian as an official language in Eastern Ukraine, outlawed left-wing political parties (due to their sympathy with Russia) and outright banned and/or greatly curtailed books imported from Russia. Right-wing thugs meanwhile attacked left-wing political gatherings and drove them underground while the Ukrainian government looked the other way. NED\u2019s president, Carl Gershwin (prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to neo-con Jeanne Kirkpatrick of the Reagan administration) openly boasted that Maidan was a first step toward ousting Putin. This sort of statement fell short of optimal diplomacy, but was, and is, ubiquitous among Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment (aka, \u201cthe Blob\u201d).\n\nShortly after Maidan\u2014and the violence and repression that followed\u2014the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine passed referendums demanding (depending on how one translates) either to be fully independent or at least autonomous (the latter would be akin to creating Ukrainian federalism akin to that of the United States). There is little question that the referendums were replete with irregularities and coercion and lacked legitimacy under Ukrainian law. It\u2019s equally clear that much of the Donbas population\u2014with equal justification\u2014believed the Maidan government to be illegal (Yanukovych, after all, had prevailed in a fair election) and were infuriated by the Maidan government\u2019s attacks on separatists.\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, poured $2.5 billion into Ukraine\u2019s military seeking to modernize it, partly so it could recapture the breakaway states. The CIA began training Ukrainians to fight in the Donbas in 2015. Though it performed poorly in the early days, the Ukrainian army, along with right-wing paramilitary forces (there were 102,000 of them as of 2020), soon began inflicting agonies. In the war that followed, some 14,000 died between 2014 and 2022. According to the U.N., 81% of civilian casualties were in rebel-held areas between 2018 and 2021, a time when cease-fire agreements supposedly existed in accordance with Minsk protocols. To be sure, civilian casualties had diminished steeply from 2014-15, but cease-fire violations were numerous, and it was Ukrainian attackers who were mostly in violation.\n\nAn aside here on Ukrainian neo-Nazis who played roles in both the Maidan revolution and the fighting in the Donbas: There\u2019s a concerted effort afoot to paint them as selfless patriots who either never were genuine Nazis, or who have given up their ideology, or who represent but a tiny sliver of Ukraine\u2019s population. Examine reporting on those same right-wing zealots from before the Russian invasion and you\u2019ll find a different picture.\n\nIn 2020, Tim Lister of the U.S. Military Academy\u2019s Combating Terrorism Center had this to say: \u201cIn recent years, some Americans and Europeans drawn to various brands of far-right nationalism have looked to Ukraine as their field of dreams: a country with a well-established, trained, and equipped far-right militia\u2014the Azov Regiment\u2014that has been actively engaged in the conflict against Russian-backed separatists in Donbas. Most of these \u2018foreign fighters\u2019 appear to travel as individuals and at their own expense, according to the author\u2019s review of many cases, but there is a broader relationship between the Ukrainian far-right, and especially its political flagship the National Corps, and a variety of far-right groups and individuals in the United States and Europe.\u201d\n\nThough the U.S. theoretically bars arms shipments to Ukraine\u2019s right-wing militias, there is no way to know precisely where the massive influx of arms will go (just as there was no way to stop U.S. arms shipments from flowing to Al Nusra in Syria or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan). You can find more now pass\u00e9 and impolitic warnings about Ukraine\u2019s Nazis here, here, here, here, and here. Also, here, here, here, and here. And here, too. And here, here, here, and here. And here and here and here. The U.S. policy of flooding Ukraine with arms, in short, might well strengthen (and embolden) far-right constituencies throughout Eastern Europe, and possibly Western Europe.\n\nTo end the fighting, Ukraine, Russia, the Donbas states, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) hammered out the Minsk I and Minsk II accords in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Both created a path for the breakaway regions to gain autonomous status. The Ukrainian right, however\u2014which continued to pour fighters into the Donbas\u2014refused to honor the terms and the Ukrainian government did little to restrain them. Though President Zelensky demanded that right-wing militias leave the Donbas as a preliminary to making peace with Russia, he was met with adamant refusal as well as threats on his life. Since then, he has decided to work with the far-right. Ethnic Russians in the Donbas also violated the accords. Both sides, according to the U.N., abducted and tortured opponents, though the most gratuitous crime was committed by pro-Maidan forces that in 2014 set fire to a trade union building in Odessa, killing over 40 anti-Maidan protestors.\n\nSo, why did Putin and Russia wait to attack Ukraine until 2022, fully eight years after Russia annexed Crimea and the Donbas declared independence? Putin claims\u2014not without evidence\u2014that Ukraine was planning an offensive to reclaim Crimea and the Donbas. How did he know? Partly because President Zelensky had announced his intention to do so in 2021. Then\u2014in summer 2022, presumably\u2014Ukraine would join NATO as a full member. Zelensky announced that, too, in a tweet he later deleted (Zelensky, incidentally, asked the U.S. to say once and for all whether Ukraine would be allowed into NATO. He was told that no, probably not, but for appearances sake the answer was yes. Some observers suggest that the U.S., by leaving the door open, was deliberately luring Putin into war.) Once Ukraine joined NATO, Russia would have faced an Article 5 war against NATO to defend either the Donbas or its annexed territory in Crimea. Article 5 is the article in NATO\u2019s charter stipulating that a war against one member is a war against all, and that all will defend the one. Russia had zero prospect of winning such a war short of using nuclear weapons.\n\nThat alone, however, did not precipitate immediate attack. Putin massed forces on Ukraine\u2019s border in the hope of forcing Ukraine and the West to agree to Ukraine\u2019s neutrality (that is, a guarantee that Ukraine would not join NATO). He was also reacting to Ukraine\u2019s violation of the Minsk accords, including an increase in shelling and the use of weaponized drones. President Zelensky\u2019s stated willingness to pursue nuclear weapons undoubtedly figured in Putin\u2019s thinking, too.\n\nAccording to CIA sources, Putin\u2019s decision to attack Ukraine was made at the last minute, after his diplomatic overtures (which included direct talks with European leaders) failed. In other words, contrary to endless assertions in our media, the attack on Ukraine was not a long-planned decision meant to recreate the Soviet Union.\n\nIf Putin was correct\u2014if Ukraine intended to recapture Crimea and the Donbas, then promptly sign on with NATO\u2014his decision to invade was a preemptive strategy. That is not to say he lacked peaceful options. He could have recognized the Donbas states and stationed troops in them without embarking on a wholesale invasion. Alternately, he could have continued to seek support for the Minsk protocols, especially given that the Donbas holds limited economic and strategic importance to Russia and is an enormous drain on the Russian treasury. It is harder, however, to imagine Putin surrendering Russia\u2019s strategically important Black Sea naval base at Sevastopol (Crimea), which Ukraine would hand over to NATO. An apt analogy would be Cuba handing over the American base at Guantanamo to Russia. The U.S. would never allow it.\n\nWhatever his options, he declared a war. No doubt you have noticed, given that the U.S. media spent more time covering the Ukraine war in the last month than it spent in any previous month on any war in the past 31 years, including Iraq. Either a certain news-obsessed demographic of Americans is utterly fixated on the war, or the media really really wants Americans to care about it. Or both.\n\nThat observation becomes more interesting when one considers that, according to a Rasmussen poll, support for direct U.S. involvement correlates with income. The wealthier you are, the more likely you are to support U.S. involvement (at least in the hypothetical situation that the war escalates beyond Ukraine). Wealth tracks with whiteness and educational attainment, which, in turn, tracks with the mainstream media\u2019s main clientele: prosperous white Americans who grew up during the Cold War. Mind you, the mainstream media\u2019s coverage isn\u2019t falsified; it\u2019s simply credulous. It routinely reports faulty and/or speculative intelligence that the U.S. puts out for PR and strategic purposes, not to mention self-serving Ukrainian assertions that lack independent verification. That\u2019s not to say that mainstream coverage is always wrong; it\u2019s mostly just frenetic and fulsome. But don\u2019t even think about calling it propaganda.\n\nI find the situation frightening and deplorable. Frightening because any direct involvement by U.S. forces could escalate into nuclear war, starting with Russia\u2019s use of tactical nuclear weapons (which it has in abundance) to stop troop flows and arms shipments. Deplorable because the U.S. (and British) media have stoked an inferno of self-righteous rage, all in support of a country that has little strategic significance to the United States (or Britain).\n\nYes, I pity Ukrainians, who are being slaughtered by Russia\u2019s war machine. I hope the Ukrainians win without a prolonged bloodbath. But no, I do not believe that Ukraine\u2019s defeat would lead Russia to attack NATO or recreate the Soviet Union. As the scholar John Mearsheimer has noted, those are fables that Western policy elites tell themselves to deny their own culpability. Nor do I think that guaranteeing that Ukraine will remain neutral, rather than join NATO, will encourage China to think \u201caha, we can attack Taiwan and the U.S. will stay out of it!\u201d Such stories\u2014that diplomacy will make the U.S. \u201clook weak\u201d\u2014are endlessly recycled in every single conflict we enter, which is partly why we stayed in Vietnam and Afghanistan long after any conceivable progress was achievable.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re going to care about Ukraine, maybe we should also start caring about Yemen, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have died miserable deaths due to Saudi Arabia\u2019s attack on a sovereign nation, or about Syria, where our own occupying forces and proxies have displaced 7.1 million people and perpetuated a war that has cost more than 600,000 lives and untold misery (not least due to crippling Western sanctions that starve and impoverish millions), or about our own war crimes in Iraq, where our invasion led directly to the violent deaths of between 184,382 and 207,168 civilians (and hundreds of thousands more indirectly), or Libya, where NATO\u2019s regime change operation turned the most prosperous country in Africa into a fratricidal warlord state with open slave markets.\n\nOur press gives us wall-to-wall images of suffering in Ukraine, including images of bombed-out buildings and murdered civilians that attest to \u201cgenocide.\u201d If one wants to see equally convincing attestations to genocide, take a look at images of Fallujah, Iraq, where the U.S. and allied forces used white phosphorous and cluster bombs (and buried corpses, including some tied and shot, in mass graves) and destroyed 36,000 homes, 60 schools, and 65 mosques. Or, look at Mosul, Iraq, after the U.S. leveled it, with a nary a mention of civilian corpses. Or, Raqqa, Syria.\n\nRussia isn\u2019t the only nation that commits wartime atrocities.\n\nWhich brings us to the question: why does the West hate Putin so much? I have zero doubt that Putin is an autocrat who can be ruthless (as witnessed by the 1999 bombing of Grozny, which the West ambivalently condemned). Nor do I doubt that Russia, like the U.S., but on a smaller scale, meddles in other countries\u2019 elections for strategic purposes (though what Russia did in our 2016 election has been grossly overstated and misrepresented). I am inclined to think, too, though evidence isn\u2019t iron-clad, Putin has approved the assassinations of turncoat spies and journalists. All that is likely true. And yet the U.S. supports ally nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that are far more authoritarian than Putin\u2019s Russia. Nor is Ukraine itself innocent of human rights abuses, including torture, murder, and political repression. What, then, makes us hate Putin so much?\n\nThe answer is threefold. First, Russia\u2019s 2015 intervention in Syria on behalf of its longtime ally, Bashir Assad, ramped up tensions to new heights. The U.S.\u2014which was spending a billion dollars a year to arm supposedly \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d rightly condemned Assad and Russia for war crimes but had little or no interest in atrocities by their own proxies. Because the press focused on Syrian/Russian atrocities, moreover, the American public gained little understanding of Russian motives (namely, to protect their longtime military base in Syria and to prevent a Daesh-type government from replacing Assad).\n\nThen\u2014on the heels of Russian entry into the Syrian conflict\u2014came the Russiagate furor, which was repeatedly distorted and exaggerated by venues like MSNBC, CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, for whom Russiagate was a financial windfall. Amid the blizzard of hyperbolic punditry, 67% of Democrats came to believe that Russia had actually changed vote totals in the 2016 presidential election. The impeachment sagas of 2018 and 2020 more firmly linked Russiagate to the cause of Ukrainians whom Trump stood accused of endangering. The U.S. must arm Ukrainians in their fight against Russia, intoned impeachment lawyer Pamela Karlin, so that \u201cwe don't have to fight them here\u201d (even as the Minsk Accords, in theory, remained in effect). Any number of Congressional Democrats joined her chorus of Red Dawn-style hyperbole.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile\u2014despite their anger over the false Russiagate charges\u2014never really abandoned their Cold War mentality. After Russia invaded Ukraine, they were more than happy to resurrect Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 contention that Russia remained our country\u2019s greatest nemesis. It wasn\u2019t, but the ubiquity of Russophobia among foreign policy elites made his statement self-fulfilling. Lindsay Graham and John McCain\u2014long the GOP\u2019s and most eager and strident hawks\u2014personally advanced Romney\u2019s Cold War narrative by visiting Ukraine in 2017, where they promised to help Ukrainian troops prosecute their war against separatists. When Russia launched its invasion, the GOP finally had its 1980s foreign policy back.\n\nWhat all this leads up to is simply this: if Americans who fly Ukrainian flags actually want to help Ukrainians, they would be well advised to support diplomatic negotiations rather than limitless flows of weaponry. It is highly unlikely that Putin will withdraw without a negotiated settlement that would include a promise that Ukraine will not join NATO, as well as some guarantee that the Ukraine will recognize Crimea as part of Russia and grant autonomy to the Donbas. What Russia might provide, in return, would be war reparations (couched as \u201ceconomic aid\u201d) and recognition of Kosovo.

            "text": "Two months on from the start of the war, Russia seems no closer to achieving its original aims. Even if taken at face value, the recent announcement that the goal is now the capture of Donbas and southern Ukrainian territory, creating a land bridge from Crimea, is a dramatic climbdown from the original goals of conquering the whole country, effecting regime change, and forcing Nato to retreat to the force posture of the mid-1990s.\n\nRevising goals downward so early in a war of choice is, of course, a sign that the Kremlin thinks things are going badly. And there is every reason to think that things are going to get significantly worse for Putin.\n\nFrom the start of the war, western analysis has highlighted the Russian army\u2019s apparent problems with logistics, communication, equipment, training and morale. All of these are issues that could in theory be fixed, greatly improving Russia\u2019s capacity to fight the war. But there are two immediate problems with this. The first is the impact of sanctions, which will continue to put pressure on Russian finances, ultimately limiting the Kremlin\u2019s capacity to spend its way out of the difficulty. Sanctions also pose a challenge to attempts to resupply and repair\u2014let alone upgrade\u2014equipment, because they cover military and technology sales.\n\nThe second problem is time. Russian personnel and equipment losses have been enormous. Repairing and building new vehicles, planes and helicopters is a slow process, and it takes many years to replace lost warships. It also takes time to adequately train soldiers to replace the many thousands killed and wounded. Russia appears to be losing men and weapons more quickly than it can replace them; unless this changes, it spells defeat.\n\nBut even if the Kremlin were able to overcome these problems, there are two further, fundamental challenges concerning the conduct of the war and its aims that are entirely outside its control. These mean Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine will continue to fail.\n\nThe first is that the west seems committed to supplying Ukraine with military assistance for the foreseeable future. The scale of this aid is staggering. The United States alone has provided or pledged $3.4bn in military assistance since the start of the war, including $1.6bn in the last two weeks alone; the top ten countries providing military aid have collectively pledged nearly $6bn. It is impossible for Russia to compete with this.\n\nBeyond the headline figures, the specifics of western aid should also be deeply worrying for the Kremlin. The most obvious problem for Putin is that aid is seemingly being tailored to address the changing character of the war. The UK government, for example, has announced that it will \u201cbackfill\u201d Polish tank capacity, supplying Poland with tanks that will enable the country to supply its own tanks to Ukraine. Like the recent announcement that the US will provide armoured personnel carriers and howitzers, this seems designed to help Ukraine in the fight for its eastern territory.\n\nEarly in the war, concerns about the risk of escalation appeared to be limiting the types of western aid provided to Ukraine. The Kremlin attempted to increase this anxiety, and so choke off the aid supply, by announcing that western supply convoys would be regarded as legitimate targets and by making ominous, if vague, noises about nuclear weapons. The latest round of pledges from western donors suggests that these threats may be causing less concern than previously, or that that they carry less weight because the will to support Ukraine has strengthened. Either is very bad news for Putin, since this was almost the only lever that he could pull to try to slow or stop aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe public acknowledgement by western leaders that the war could last for years is an important signal that they are not shaping policy in expectation of a quick resolution; they are preparing their populations for a long-term commitment to Ukraine. Any hopes that Putin may have pinned on nervousness about this would seem to be misplaced.\n\nThis means that Russia, with its capacity to wage war significantly degraded by the first two months of fighting and with limited (and declining) scope to reverse its losses, will have to deal with an opponent benefitting from a seemingly open-ended supply of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of weapons. That is not sustainable.\n\nThere is a second fundamental issue that Putin is unable to control. In aiming to weaken the west and turn the European strategic clock back, he has triggered the opposite outcome. Although differences inevitably remain, western states look much more united than they have at any point this century, and much more focused on strengthening military capacity in the face of Russian threats. It now looks possible that despite their long histories of neutrality, Finland and Sweden will join Nato. This would be a strategic disaster and a profound humiliation for Russia. Threats intended to prevent their accession seem to be having the reverse effect. Whatever short-term gains the Russian army may make by reducing cities like Mariupol to ruins, the medium- and long-term prospects look disastrous for Putin, and he appears powerless to do anything about it.",

            "text": "Russia-Ukraine War: Is The World Witnessing Another \u2018Cold War\u2019 Era?\n\nBy Mukhtar Ya\u2019u Madobi\n\nOf course, it was true, which is hard to believe. We have been hearing about the first and second world wars and how they were fought, because we never had a chance to witness any of them. Nevertheless, in what appears to be akin to a recipe for the third world war, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin had in Late February authorized a \u2018special military operation\u2019 against the neighboring country, Ukraine. This is to press home his demands about Russia\u2019s refusal to allow Ukraine join the United States and European military alliance, known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.\n\nThe Russian forces have so far invaded the country, seized many cities, strategic institutions and facilities that are very crucial to Ukraine as a corporate nation. Alas, a lot of people have been killed, wounded while a host of others were sent packing as refugees around the border of neighboring countries. The situation has really led to a critical emergency response as the UN stated that more than 3million Ukrainians have currently plunged into deep humanitarian crises and are in dire need of assistance.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the war, the Russian Federation had for months stationed a large number of troops around the Ukraine border as a precautionary measure for any attempt by the NATO forces to establish their presence in Ukraine. A lot of efforts have been made through mediation by international organizations to avert this unfortunate experience, but no light was found at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThis is due to the obsession of the Ukraine President, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky obsession to join forces with NATO as well as the latter\u2019s long term ambition to also expand their geographical reach downward the eastern Europe so as to establish proximity to Russia by creating a military base in an ally country, specifically the presently war-torn Ukraine.\n\nA lot of pundits, which I shared the same view with, argued that Zelensky was thoughtless to have engaged his country into war with Russia, a fight which he knows clearly that he never stood a chance of winning due to superior military spirits of Russia. Because, the Russian military forces put at 1,014,000 with reserve forces of 2,000,000 are five times greater than Ukrainian military forces of 200,000 and reservists of 500,000. Thus, it is obvious that the latter is no match for the former.\n\nEven though I wasn\u2019t born, from what I have read in history, the present Ukrainian situation is just a replica of the olden days \u2018cold war\u2019 between the two world \u2018super powers\u2019 i.e. the defunct Soviet Union (presently Russia) and the United State of America. It is obvious that they are now fighting a proxy war thereby using Ukraine as a battle ground to flex their muscles and showcase their military prowess.\n\nLet me flash our memories a little back to the era of cold war for the purpose of adequate comprehension of this article.\n\nAfter the Second World War ended with the defeat of Germany, Japan and Italy in the hands of the alliance comprising mainly Great Britain, Soviet Russia and the USA. The United States with its economic wealth and military strength, no doubt, made a matchless contribution to the victory in the War and it was felt that its strengths and leadership would be needed to maintain peace in the post-War world, too. Having contributed significantly to the victory in the war, Soviet Russia was not to be sidelined; the country claimed equal say in deciding on European problems.\n\nNevertheless, not so long after this gentlemen\u2019s agreement, the US and the Soviet Union developed differences about working together for the peace and stability of Europe. There were political and ideological reasons for these differences. The US practiced and preached \u2018democracy\u2019 and \u2018free market\u2019 enterprise as the desirable model of governance, while the Soviet Union believed and practiced governance by a single (communist) party and of state-controlled economy.\n\nThese differences led to feelings of one being threatened by the other. So began the bipolar phase in the world order immediately after the War. The United States and the Soviet Union stood out as two opposite poles around which, to begin with, European politics revolved. While the countries of Western Europe joined hands with the US and called themselves the \u201cFree World\u201d, countries of Eastern Europe became part of the Socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. These two leading countries of rival camps were clubbed under the exclusive, new category of \u201csuper powers\u201d.\n\nRelations between East and West were never cordial. Short of going to war directly, the two camps indulged constantly in political and military competition. This state of affairs was widely called the \u201cCold War\u201d. The Cold War was marked by a great deal of competition in forming military alliances, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO).\n\nNATO was formed in 1949 with the United States, Canada and 10 countries in Western Europe including Belgium, Britain, Netherlands, West Germany, France etc. The Soviet Union then cleverly offered to join the alliance, but NATO turned down the offer because NATO\u2019s real purpose was to stop the spread of the Soviet influence and ideology.\n\nAs a result, the Soviet Union set up in 1955 its own military grouping, the WTO with its allies in Eastern Europe to counter NATO. The original members are; Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania.\n\nHowever, the Soviet Union broke up into the Russian Federation and 14 other Republics in 1991 and the WTO was equally disbanded. All these new states abandoned socialism and embraced Western ideology of \u2018democracy\u2019 and \u2018free market economy\u2019. For example, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland joined NATO on March 12 March 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia joined in March 2004 and Albania joined on 1 April 2009.\n\nIt was regarded as a grand victory for the US as it has recorded victory in the Cold War and it became an object of both admiration and fear. The US became the single remaining super power with the fall of socialism and breakup of the Soviet Union\n\nSo going back to our previous discussion, it is obviously simple to understand why Russia invaded Ukraine all of sudden. It is apparent that NATO-US would have the right to establish a military base in Ukraine soil immediately when it joins the alliance. And this gives them proximity to Russia, which is one of the vicious thorns in their flesh.\n\nIt can be recalled that the US invaded Cuba in 1961 because the Soviet wanted to build a military base in that country. Cuba is a few miles away from the US and the latter felt threatened by the Russian presence back then. So why should NATO and the US now build a military base in Ukraine which is also a few miles away from Moscow, the capital city of Russia? Putin is not stupid. He clearly knows that the moment NATO/US enters Ukraine and establishes a military base, then Russia is vulnerable to attack anytime.\n\nAdditionally, NATO and US breached the 1990 treaty which prevented NATO and US from expanding eastwards of Europe from the then East Germany. As of today, NATO establishes its presence almost everywhere in eastern Europe including Croatia, Poland and other places that are closer to Russia. Thus, getting closer to Russia means NATO and US missiles can strike Moscow very quickly without wasting time.\n\nOver the years, as a result of their vested interests, US-NATO forces have been playing a vital role in creating tensions among various countries in the world. Recall that in 2011, NATO and French forces ransacked Libya and killed Colonel Muammar Ghaddafi of blessed memory. Libya that used to be a prosperous nation has now reduced to a poverty and war-ravaged country in Africa.\n\nAlso, US single-handedly invaded Iraq in 1990, bombed the country and also killed Saddam Hussein, the President. America claimed to have acted on \u2018credible intelligence\u2019 which turned out to be false, saying that Iraq had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction and up to now, none of such was found. Today Iraq lies in ruins with no sober government.\n\nAdditionally, they also pounded on Syria and nearly overthrew its President, Bashar Al-Asaad if not because of Russia\u2019s intervention. For over decade, Syria has been shattered and turned to safe haven, swarmed by criminal elements including terrorists.\n\nAs of today, Afghanistan that used to be a peaceful nation has now become stateless after so many years of war occasioned by the presence of the US after the Russians have left. Today Afghanistan is a total mess.\n\nAs it stands now, US and NATO have started sending military logistics to allied nations which will apparently sneak their way into Ukraine. This is dangerous and it might prove the assertion by Russia that NATO and US wants to enter Ukraine so that it can launch attacks on Russian soil.\n\nBelieve me, when this happens, those staunch allies to Russia including China, India, Syria, Iran, the defiant boy of North Korea and others will surely waste no time in coming to its aid. In fact, North Korea has already started testing ballistic missiles and would be ready to shell her close rival and US ally, South Korea at the glimpse of an opportunity.\n\nSo, is the Third World War knocking on our doors?\n\nHonestly, US and NATO unwarranted activities should be checked, if not, they might wake up one day and decide to replace the government of any country they deem fit with another.\n\nMeanwhile NATO and US should cast aside their greediness of expanding eastward of Europe, especially toward Russia as a mark of respect for the treaty they signed earlier on that regard.\n\nTo the inexperienced Zelensky of Ukraine, who allowed himself to be brainwashed by turning his country into a battlefield for NATO/US and Russian forces, the earlier he shelves his interest in joining that military alliance, the better for him and his country as he never stands a chance of emerging victorious against Russia.\n\nBecause, none of NATO/US forces will engage in direct physical confrontations with fully nuclear missiles armed Russia as a result of the known consequences that might accompany such recklessness.",

            "text": "Placeholder while article actions load\n\nThe United Nations secretary general called this week for an Easter truce between Russia and Ukraine. Orthodox Christians in both countries observe Easter on Sunday. But as the fighting continued to rage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow on Thursday of rejecting the U.N. proposal. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Russia\u2019s invasion has roiled global markets, revived the NATO alliance and triggered war crimes investigations. It has also opened a rift in the Orthodox Church, pitting the Russian wing and its pro-Kremlin patriarch against Orthodox leaders in Kyiv and around the globe.\n\nOrthodox Christianity is one of the largest Christian communions in the world \u2014 after Catholicism and the Protestant church. Most of its roughly 260 million adherents are concentrated in Europe, Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union.\n\nDespite the ongoing Russian invasion of their country, Ukrainians celebrated Orthodox Easter on April 24. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nIt is the dominant faith in both Russia and Ukraine, where the status of the church has become a source of tension between Moscow and Kyiv. For Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally in the church, Patriarch Kirill, Ukraine is an inseparable part of a greater Russian world \u2014 one with Moscow as its political center and Kyiv as its spiritual hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this, Kirill, 75, has offered a full-throated endorsement of the war, doubling down even as the world recoils at widespread reports of Russian atrocities in Ukraine. His pro-war stance has angered other church leaders, in Ukraine and across the Orthodox faith, many of whom have condemned the war and urged Kirill to reconsider his support.\n\nAs the Orthodox world celebrates its Easter holiday Sunday, here\u2019s how the tensions within the church are playing out:\n\nRussian Orthodox Church\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is one of the largest and most influential in the world, with more than 100 million followers, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2009, Kirill was elected patriarch \u2014 the first since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nAt first, Kirill was seen as a modernizer who might carve out some independence for the church, after his predecessor, Alexiy II, used his political ties to raise the church\u2019s profile after decades of atheist communism. Russian politicians bankrolled the construction of new churches, and religious leaders appeared front and center at state functions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, however, Kirill has solidified his role as an ally of the Kremlin, helping Putin cloak his political and military ambitions in the language of faith.\n\nOn Feb. 23, one day before the invasion, Kirill released a statement praising Putin for his \u201chigh and responsible service to the people of Russia\u201d and describing mandatory military service as \u201can active manifestation of evangelical love for neighbors.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since the war started, Kirill has used his sermons to justify the campaign, portraying it as a struggle against sinful Western culture \u2014 although he is careful to avoid referring to the conflict as a war or invasion that was launched by Russia.\n\nHe has focused almost entirely on what he calls Ukraine\u2019s \u201cextermination\u201d of pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region in the eastern part of the country. Earlier this month, Kirill delivered a sermon urging Russians to rally around the government \u201cduring this difficult time,\u201d the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet the Lord help us unite during this difficult time for our Fatherland, including around the authorities,\u201d the Interfax news agency quoted Kirill as saying at a sermon in Moscow.\n\nUkrainian Orthodox Church \u2014 Moscow Patriarchate\n\nThe vast majority of Ukrainians identify as Orthodox Christian, according to Pew. Their loyalties, however, are split between at least two major ecclesiastical bodies, one being the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is \u201cself-governing\u201d but remains under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nFor centuries, churches in Ukraine and Russia were both under the leadership of the Moscow patriarch. However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the church in Ukraine pressed for \u2014 and obtained \u2014 semiautonomous status in 1990.\n\nBut in recent years, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine, an increasing number of Ukrainian followers have sought to counter what they see as Moscow\u2019s influence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the invasion, those calls have intensified \u2014 and parishioners have grown angry over the Russian Orthodox Church\u2019s support for the war. All of this has put the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its leader, Metropolitan Onuphury, in a precarious position, particularly as reports of civilian massacres and other atrocities mount.\n\nOn Feb. 24, the day of the invasion, Onuphury released a statement calling the military campaign a \u201cdisaster\u201d and appealing to Putin to \u201cimmediately stop the fratricidal war.\u201d\n\nThe war between Russians and Ukrainians \u201cis a repetition of the sin of Cain, who killed his own brother out of envy,\u201d Onuphury said. \u201cSuch a war has no justification either from God or from people.\u201d\n\nThe church has emphasized its role in providing assistance to civilians and presiding over the burial of Ukrainian service members. Some priests have stopped commemorating Kirill in their services or have called on Onuphury to break away from Moscow entirely.\n\nOrthodox Church of Ukraine\n\nThe Orthodox Church of Ukraine is three years old. Its founding was the direct result of the burgeoning movement to peel away from the Russian Orthodox Church and create a purely independent ecclesiastical entity for Ukraine. The church\u2019s recognition by the patriarchate in Turkey angered Moscow, and the Russian Orthodox Church severed its ties with that body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leader of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine is Metropolitan Epiphanius, 43, who has been vocal in his criticism of Putin and the war. Soon after the invasion, Epiphanius released a statement likening the Russian leader to both the Antichrist and Adolf Hitler.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of the Antichrist operates in the leader of Russia, the signs of which the Scriptures reveal to us: pride, devotion to evil, ruthlessness, false religiosity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was Hitler during World War II. This is what Putin has become today.\u201d\n\nThis week, after he visited the devastated city of Chernihiv, Epiphanius urged Ukrainians to continue to fight the Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cSeeing the suffering, destruction, brutal violence and spread of death that Russia brings to every corner of Ukraine ... we understand even better that only the fight against the aggressor [and] his expulsion from our land can bring us a just peace,\u201d he said.\n\nEcumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is one of the world\u2019s oldest institutions. The Orthodox Church has no single leader, but Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is considered its spiritual guide and \u201cfirst among equals\u201d with the other patriarchs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBartholomew has been critical of Moscow and the war, and of Kirill and the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nOn the first day of the invasion, he condemned what he said was an \u201cunprovoked attack by Russia against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nLater, in an interview with CNN Turk, he defended his decision to grant autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and warned that Russia\u2019s aggression and isolation could lead to a \u201cnew Cold War.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole world is against Russia,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cThe distance between Russia and the Western world is getting bigger. It means that we are entering a new Cold War period.\u201d\n\nThe patriarchate has delivered humanitarian aid to the church in Kyiv. On a visit to Poland in late March, Bartholomew denounced the invasion as an \u201catrocious\u201d act.\n\n\u201cIt is simply impossible to imagine how much devastation this atrocious invasion has caused for the Ukrainian people and the entire world,\u201d Bartholomew said at a news briefing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe added that solidarity with Ukrainians \u201cis the only thing that can overcome evil and darkness in the world.\u201d\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

I dream that I will be able to return so that I can celebrate Easter at my home and that my daughter will be with her family.\u201d\n\nMore than 5 million Ukrainians have fled since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, with the majority seeking safety in the European Union through border crossings in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania.\n\nMany of the refugees have chosen to wait out the war with friends and family in Poland whose pre-war Ukrainian community of around 1.5 million represented the region\u2019s largest.\n\nLike many fellow churchgoers, Bohdana Dudka, 27, snapped photos to send home to family members including her two brothers who remained in Ukraine to fight.\n\n\u201cI hope the next Easter holiday will be at home in Ukraine,\u201d Dudka said. \u201cI would like to thank the Poles for helping Ukrainians so much. We came with nothing and here people help each other.\u201d\n\nAs Ukrainians celebrated Orthodox Easter on Sunday, there was no end in sight to a war that has killed thousands, uprooted millions and reduced cities to rubble.\n\nMoscow, which describes its actions in Ukraine as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to demilitarise its neighbour, denies targeting civilians and rejects what Ukraine says is evidence of atrocities, saying Kyiv staged them.\n\nInside Ukraine, subdued Easter celebrations took place across the country as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed in an Orthodox Easter message that no \u201cwickedness\u201d would destroy the country.\n\nA REMINDER OF HOME\n\nIn Prague, which boasted a pre-war Ukrainian community of nearly 200,000, Nataliya Krasnopolskaia said she began attending services regularly at the Cathedral Church of Sts Cyril and Methodius since arriving from Odesa on March 6.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine I only go for the holidays but in Prague I try to go to the church every Sunday,\u201d she said referring to the Prague church where World War Two resistance fighters hid after assassinating Nazi police chief Reinhard Heydrich.\n\n\u201cI pray that this horror in Ukraine ends soon and we can return home.\u201d\n\nAt Berlin\u2019s Nathanael Church, Ukrainian community leaders said the congregation of around 500 would swell to an expected 2,500 people for the celebrations where refugees said the singing and traditions reminded them of home. More than 369,000 Ukrainians have registered in Germany after fleeing the war.\n\nInside the church, attendees crossed themselves while singing hymns as others silently took turns lighting candles. Outside, a long line of children stood on the grass with Easter egg baskets in front of them as a priest walked by sprinkling them with water.\n\n\u201cEverything today is like in Ukraine with so many people and this atmosphere,\u201d said Diana Shyndak,23, originally from Kyiv. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see so many people here that can celebrate Easter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first Easter celebration not in Ukraine. It\u2019s sad and my heart hurts because so many people have died.

            "text": "By Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA)\n\nBy Bipandeep Sharma*\n\nThe Arctic region witnessed extensive militarisation during the Second World War. In the Cold War period, despite military exercises conducted by rival blocks\u2014the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact countries\u2014the Arctic remained stable without any confrontation. In fact, the 196-km border between the Soviet Union and Norway (the only NATO-member country to share a border with the Soviet Union) remained peaceful throughout the Cold War. In 1987, with the Cold War in its end-phase, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in his famous \u2018Murmansk Speech\u2019, called for the Arctic as a \u2018Zone of Peace\u2019 and emphasised the need for cooperation in the region. 1\n\nGorbachev\u2019s vision was reciprocated by the West. The first environmental cooperative initiative, called the \u2018Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy\u2019 (AEPS), was signed by eight Arctic states in 1991.2 AEPS was the initiative of government of Finland that resulted in successful conclusion of various cooperative measures to protect the Arctic environment. 3 These eight Arctic states in 1996 signed the Ottawa Declaration which led to the establishment of the Arctic Council.4 Since its formation, the Arctic Council has become an important forum for addressing issues of environment, sustainable development and purveying the socio-economic context in the region.5 The Arctic Council is the most important intergovernmental forum for cooperation between the Arctic states in the high north. The working of the Arctic Council is executed through its six working groups and the decision making within the Council is based on \u2018consensus basis\u2019.\n\nIn February 2022, as a result of Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine, the seven Western Arctic states (A7), 6 five of which are members of NATO,7 have issued a joint statement to \u2018temporarily pause\u2019 their participation in all meetings of the Council and its subsidiary bodies.8 These states argued that the Arctic Council works on the fundamental rules of international law, and Russia, which currently holds the chairmanship of the Arctic Council, has violated it. While describing the action as \u2018regrettable\u2019, Russia, in response, highlighted that the Arctic Council has remained depoliticised, despite the past geopolitical issues.9\n\nThe A7\u2019s decision could have serious implications for the Arctic. First, all the eight Arctic states are at close geographical proximity to one another. Even a temporary suspension of the Arctic Council could challenge its established credibility and decision making. This could enhance geopolitical competition by superseding the existing scientific cooperation, consensus on environmental concerns and other mutually agreed solidarities between the states in the region.\n\nSecond, the Arctic contains multiple existing issues of territorial sovereignty, resource exploitation and disagreements over national/international shipping routes. Suspending the working of the Arctic Council would terminate the existing cooperation, resulting in unwanted strategic competition in the region. Furthermore, in order to protect their own self-interests in the Arctic, a potential military build-up can be expected.\n\nThird, Russia holds the largest territorial and coastal extent in the Arctic. It remains the only state with strong Arctic infrastructure and military capabilities. The Russian Arctic accounts for almost half of the total Arctic population living in the region.10 If the current situation prevails or the A7 countries consider forming any new alliance or forum without Russia, it would polarise the Arctic region, which could lead to dangerous outcomes. Similarly, any such alternative approach/alliance by Russia with non-Arctic states, would further challenge the existing cooperation in the region.11\n\nFourth, the issue of climate change is serious in the Arctic, where the global warming is occurring at thrice the average normal. Suspension of all established cooperation with Russia through Arctic Council, would seriously affect academic and scientific engagements between states on climate research in the region.\n\nFifth, the Arctic Council has become successful in negotiating three important legally binding agreements in the region. These include \u2018Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation\u2019,12\u2018Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response\u2019,13 and the \u2018Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic\u2019.14 Also, all the Arctic states have successfully concluded an \u2018International Agreement on Prevention of Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean\u2019.15 As a counter measure to A7\u2019s decision on the Arctic Council, Russia may consider withdrawing from these important agreements in the Arctic, which would further lead to greater insecurities in the region.\n\nSixth, apart from the Arctic permanent states, there are 13 non-Arctic observer states in the Arctic Council.16 Though these states remain outside the decision-making process of the Council, they are actively engaged in the various working groups of the Council. Asian observers such as India, China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea face vulnerabilities as a result of climate change in the Arctic. A pause in the Working Groups of the Arctic Council will have significant implications for the ongoing and future projects undertaken by these states.\n\nFinally, the ongoing debate within the Finish and the Swedish parliaments to join NATO membership will make the revival of the Arctic Council difficult, if not impossible. As and when these two Arctic Council members join NATO, it will have significant geopolitical repercussions for the region. Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, has already warned of Russia\u2019s nuclear and hypersonic deployments, if Finland and Sweden secured NATO membership.17\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Arctic Council, till recently, has proved itself to be a successful model of cooperation. Security issues were consciously kept away from the charter of the Arctic Council. The heightened political contestations in the wake of Russia\u2013Ukraine war could radically alter the spirit as well as structure of the Council. With Finland and Sweden seeking membership of NATO, the situation in the region will, in all likelihood, aggravate further. How the Arctic Council responds to these developments and whether it will remould itself is a moot question.\n\nViews expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Manohar Parrrikar IDSA or of the Government of India.\n\n*About the author: Bipandeep Sharma is a Research Analyst at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.\n\nSource: This article was published by Manohar Parrrikar IDSA",

He criticised Macron for holding talks with Putin (\"Would you negotiate with Hitler?\") and Scholz for prioritising German business interests https://t.co/GGRX0hOypT \u2014 Notes from Poland \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@notesfrompoland) April 4, 2022\n\nPoland had previously been one of Europe\u2019s largest importers of Russian oil, but the government pledged last month to end all imports of oil, gas and coal from Russia by the end of this year. It admits that its embargo on coal may violate EU rules, but said that it \u201ccannot wait any longer\u201d for Brussels to act.\n\nPolish officials were also among the first to warn that genocide may be taking place in Ukraine. President Andrzej Duda said as early as 2 March, six days after the invasion, that Russian actions \u201cbear the hallmarks of genocide\u201d. Polish prosecutors have been helping the International Criminal Court investigate crimes against humanity.\n\nAs well placing billboards in western European cities, the new campaign will also feature conferences organised by Polish diplomats with the presence of Ukrainian ambassadors, the government revealed.\n\nMain image credit: KPRM (under CC BY 3.0 PL)",

            "text": "KYIV: Russian forces tried to storm a steel plant sheltering soldiers and civilians in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol , and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he would meet Sunday in his nation's capital with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Zelenskyy in a news conference gave few details about the logistics of his upcoming encounter with Blinken and Austin but said he expected results \u2014 \u201cnot just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons.\u201dIt would be the first high-level US trip to Kyiv since before the war began on Feb. 24.While visiting Poland in March, Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil to meet with the country's foreign minister.Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a US leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris.Russia's effort in Mariupol is aimed at crushing the last pocket of resistance in the city, a place of deep symbolic and strategic value to Moscow. Completing its capture would give Russia its biggest victory yet, after a nearly two-month siege reduced much of the city to a smoking ruin.In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces also pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine A 3-month-old baby girl was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, officials said. Zelenskyy said 18 more were wounded. The Ukrainian news agency UNIAN said the baby's mother, Valeria Glodan, and grandmother also were killed, citing social media posts from the baby's father and others.\u201cThe war started when this baby was 1 month old. Can you imagine what is happening?\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThey are just bastards. ... I don't have any other words for it, just bastards.\u201dThe Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.The command post was hit on Friday, killing two generals and critically wounding another, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency said in a statement. The Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.The fate of the Ukrainians in the sprawling and besieged seaside steel mill in Mariupol, where Russia says its forces have taken the rest of the city, wasn't immediately clear.A Ukrainian military unit on Saturday released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun.\u201cWe want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,\u201d one woman in the video said. \u201cYou have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness.\u201dRussia said it took control of several villages elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region and destroyed 11 Ukrainian military targets overnight, including three artillery warehouses. Russian attacks also struck populated areas.Associated Press journalists observed shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city; regional Gov. Oleh Sinehubov said three people were killed.In the Luhansk area of the Donbas, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six people died during the shelling of a village, Gorskoi.In Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas, the AP witnessed two soldiers arriving at a hospital, one of them mortally wounded.Sitting in a wheelchair outside her damaged Sloviansk apartment, Anna Direnskaya, 70, said, \u201cI want peace.\u201dOne of many native Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, Direnskaya said she wishes Russians would understand that Ukrainians are not bad people and that there should be no enmity between them.\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d she said. \u201cI don't know.\u201dBritish officials said Russian forces had not gained significant new ground, but Ukrainian officials announced a nationwide curfew ahead of Easter Sunday, a sign of the war's disruption and threat to the entire country.Mariupol has been a key Russian objective and has taken on outsize importance in the war.It would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014. Russia-backed separatists control parts of the Donbas.An adviser to Ukraine's presidential office, Oleksiy Arestovych, said Russian forces resumed airstrikes on the Azovstal plant and were also trying to storm it, in an apparent reversal of tactics. Two days earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin had given an order not to send troops in but instead to blockade the plant.Ukrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops along with civilians are taking refuge in its tunnels.Earlier Saturday the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the plant, released the video of around two dozen women and children. Its contents could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians trapped underground there.The video shows soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl says she and her relatives \u201chaven't seen neither the sky nor the sun\u201d since they left home Feb. 27.The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told the AP the video was shot Thursday.The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed by far-right activists in 2014 at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and has elicited criticism for some of its tactics.More than 100,000 people \u2014 down from a prewar population of about 430,000 \u2014 are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city.Yet another attempt to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol failed Saturday. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organised buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 227 kilometres to the northwest.\u201cAt 11 o'clock, at least 200 Mariupol residents gathered near the Port City shopping centre, waiting for evacuation,\u201d Andryushchenko posted on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cThe Russian military drove up to the Mariupol residents and ordered them to disperse, because now there will be shelling.\u201dAt the same time, he said, Russian buses assembled about 200 metres (yards) away.Residents who boarded those were told they were being taken to separatist-occupied territory and not allowed to disembark, Andryushchenko said. His account could not be independently verified.In the attack on Odesa, Russian troops fired at least six missiles, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister.\u201cResidents of the city heard explosions in different areas,\u201d Gerashchenko said via Telegram.\u201cResidential buildings were hit. It is already known about one victim. He burned in his car in a courtyard of one of the buildings.\u201dZelenskyy's news conference was held in a Kyiv subway station, where he paused at one point as a train noisily passed through.The subway system, which includes the world's deepest station, attracted widespread attention early in the war when hordes of people took shelter there.Regarding the expected visit Sunday by US officials, Zelenskyy said: \u201cI believe that we will be able to get agreements from the United States or part of that package on arming Ukraine which we agreed on earlier. Besides, we have strategic questions about security guarantees, which it is time to discuss in detail, because the United States will be one of those leaders of security countries for our state.\u201d",

Russia has continued to pay Kyiv to ship about a third of its supplies to Europe via Ukraine, despite the war.\n\nWest African Nations Struggle With Basics (5:17 p.m.)\n\nNations in West Africa have been hard-hit by the Russian war in Ukraine as they struggle to import basics like fertilizer and rice, finance ministers from the region said.\n\nGambia imports a large amount of its wheat and fertilizer from Ukraine, and has lost about 20% of its revenues trying to subsidize the price of fertilizer, Finance Minister Mambury Njie said during an online briefing hosted by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nLiberia has started talks with rice importers in a bid to secure supplies, and Gambia is trying to become self sufficient in rice production. Malawi is also discouraging the excess use of cooking oil, and making plans to start producing more locally.\n\nTop Kremlin Official Visited Donetsk, Tass Says (4:21 p.m.)\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin\u2019s First Deputy Chief of Staff visited Donetsk to meet with the leaders of the self-declared Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, Russia\u2019s state-run Tass reported, citing a person it didn\u2019t identify.\n\nSergei Kiriyenko, who curates domestic policy at the Kremlin, has already returned to Moscow, Tass said.\n\nCurfews in Lviv, Elsewhere for Orthodox Easter (2:20 p.m.)\n\nRegional governors, including from the far western Lviv region, urged people to stay at home as much as possible during the Orthodox Easter, citing information on possible Russian air strikes.\n\nCurfews will typically run from 11 p.m. Saturday night until 5 a.m. Sunday.

However, US and Ukrainian officials have said the city is still contested.\n\nRussian opposition activist jailed over 'false information'\n\nRussian authorities have opened a criminal case against opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. for allegedly spreading \"false information\" about the country's armed forces.\n\nKara-Murza is the vice-chairman of Open Russia, a liberal NGO founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky \u2014 once believed the richest man in Russia before he fell foul of Putin and was jailed \u2014 who has been living in Switzerland since his release in 2013.\n\nKara-Murza was hospitalized with poisoning symptoms in 2015 and 2017.\n\nRussian media reported that similar charges were being drawn up against Ilya Krasilshchik, former publisher of independent news site Meduza.\n\nRussia adopted a law criminalizing spreading \"false information\" about its military shortly after it invaded Ukraine in late February. The offense is punishable by up to 14 years in prison.\n\nHuman rights advocates have so far counted 32 cases opened under the law.\n\nWatch video 12:28 Khodorkovsky: Clear position of West will 'help Putin make the right decision'\n\nUkraine's Zelenskyy claims Moscow plans to invade other countries\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address late on Friday that Russia plans on capturing countries other than Ukraine.\n\n\"All the nations that, like us, believe in the victory of life over death must fight with us.

Earlier, Russian chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said he had spoken to his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\nRussia's Central Military District (CFD) command said that Moscow was planning to seize Ukraine's south and open a route to Moldova's Trans-Dniester region as part of the \"second phase\" of its military operation. Ukraine's Defense Ministry denounced the plans as \"imperialism.\"\n\nRussia for the first time acknowledged casualties in the sinking of its Black Sea flagship the Moskva last week, saying that one person had died, 27 were still unaccounted for and the 396 other crew members had been rescued.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of planning to \"falsify\" a \"referendum\" in parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions that are under Russian control.\n\nGerman Development Minister Svenja Schulze told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper that Berlin would allocate funds totaling \u20ac37 million (\u20ac40.1 million) for reconstruction in Ukraine.

The first fierce battle took place there. On February 27, the first column of Russian armored forces entered Bucha. On the same day, the invading forces took heavy losses for the first time on Vokzalna Street, which was the main transportation route to Irpin. The enemy continued to push for Kyiv, but contrary to the predictions of Russian planners and Western military observers, Russian troops did not reach there in three days or thirty-three. Instead, the Ukrainian Army counterattacked.\n\nThe Russians were stopped on March 8\n\nOn March 8, military experts recorded the last successful attempt by Russian troops to attack on the right flank in the direction of Kyiv. They were moving from the formerly occupied village of Babyntsi in the direction of Kyiv with forces of up to five battalion-tactical groups, but they could not push beyond Bucha. From that moment on, Russian troops lost the ability to advance and began to prepare for defense.\n\nOn March 15, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appointed the head of the military administration in Kyiv region. He selected Oleksandr Pavliuk, former commander of the Ukrainian Peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. Awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine in early March, Zelenskyy appointed him to further strengthen the defense of the capital and Kyiv region.\n\nOn March 17, military experts reported that the Russians had begun digging in across the occupied territories. It was predicted that Russia would try to turn the war into one of attrition, and use its numerical advantage in artillery to destroy Kyiv and its defenders.\n\nOn March 21, the Russians were close to being able to fire not only cruise and ballistic missiles at the center of Kyiv, but also artillery. To accomplish this, however, they needed positions closer than 15 miles.\n\nThe distance was strategically important, because Russian forces had a limited supply of their expensive missiles to used against the capital\u2019s air defense network. Artillery shells, by contrast, are virtually impossible to intercept. They are very cheap and the Russians have huge reserves. It was the use of artillery that brought the greatest destruction to Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, and other cities.\n\nThe first reports of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops surfaced on March 19 and 20. On March 22, Ukrainian Armed Forces expelled the Russians from Makarov, a village near the Zhytomyr highway, and from the village of Moshchun near Pushcha-Vodytsya, along the Irpin River and northeast of the city of Irpin. The Irpin River bank became the main barrier utilized by the defenders of Kyiv.\n\nDue to the demolition of the dam near the village of Demydiv, the water of Irpin River \u2013 which was were previously pumped into the Kyiv Sea \u2013 overflowed and blocked the road for enemy vehicles north of the city of Irpin. The natural obstruction limited possible approaches to the capital to three, or would require the Russians to drive further South. All three bridges across the river on the Zhytomyr, Irpin, and Warsaw routes were blown up in the first days of the war.\n\nOn March 23, the first details of a siege by Russian forces in Bucha and Irpin were reported. Ukrainian troops pushed the Russians to Borodyanka and marched on the outskirts of the Warsaw route. It was along that route that the 40-mile armored convoy traveled, the main supply line for Russian invasion forces in Irpin and Bucha. The Ukrainian military was able to attack the stalled Russian vehicles at that section of the road, and destroy the rear of the Russian army near Kyiv.\n\nThere were actually two main roads for resupply at that time. The best was the Warsaw route from Bucha to Borodyanka and further \u2013 the road north to Ivankov, through the Chernobyl zone to Belarus. The second and more problematic was a little east, along the river Irpin and further to Demydiv, Dymer, and Ivankiv.\n\nFighting in the Russian rear in the region was also visible in satellite images. In a service provided by NASA that collects information about fires visible from space, plumes of burning smoke can be seen along the routes that Russian forces received supplies near Kyiv. The destruction was the result of Ukrainian artillery, and frequent ambushes that destroyed logistics at the Russian rear.\n\nThe military operation around Irpin-Bucha lasted for the next three days. According to military expert Tom Cooper, the Armed Forces went on the offensive, \u201cstriking in different places and at different times along the front line to disrupt the supply of Russian troops.\u201d He described the tactic as an effective way to keep Russian artillery beyond 15 miles from Kyiv, which prevented effective strikes at the city\u2019s center.\n\nOn March 26, it was reported that the Russian military had appointed Alexander Chayko of the Eastern Military District as commander of the 35th Separate Army near Chernobyl. He was expected to regroup Russian troops and lead them into battle. But on the March 28 there was an official announcement about the liberation of Irpin. On April 1, reports confirmed that the Russian army had left the Chernobyl zone.\n\nLiberating cities is harder than defending\n\nThe operation to liberate Irpin began two weeks after the destruction of the Russian rear by the Ukrainian Army. Ukraine Forces recaptured street after street in close combat.\n\nMilitary experts have described urban defense as a hell for any soldier. Defenders always have the advantage. They choose where to fight, and can hold back the dominant forces of the enemy. This tactic gave Ukrainians the advantage at the start of the invasion. However, once Russians captured an area the same tactic made it harder for Ukrainian troops to push them out. But Irpin was an example of Ukraine\u2019s determination, and set the stage for the liberation of the rest of Ukraine.\n\nA member of the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps (DUK), Danya Dansky, offered details of the operation. He participated against Russian hostilities in 2014, including the battles for Donetsk Airport. Before the war, Dansky worked in production of furniture. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, he began military training to defend his homeland. When Putin launched his unprovoked war to seize all of Ukraine, Dansky again volunteered.\n\nOn March 20, his unit arrived in Irpin with the task of liberating the city from enemy forces. At that time, the Ukrainian military controlled the central part of the city and the bridge to Bucha near the Giraffe Mall on Soborna Street, the central street that runs through the entire city and connects Kyiv to Bucha.\n\nOn the eastern and western outskirts of the city, and on both sides at the center, were Russian troops. But they failed to completely occupy the city. Russian troops were based in a triangle in the west of the city and in the northeast.\n\nOne of the final battles took place at the intersection of Hostomel Highway, Vulytsya Severynivs Road, and 10th Street. The Pchelka store at the crossroads was the main landmark.\n\nDansky commanded reconnaissance and cover for his tank unit. The task of his team was to find the enemy, assess its strength, help coordinate an armored attack, and protect the tank in battle. Despite considerable armor and firepower, tanks are vulnerable to anti-tank missiles and grenade launchers. The inability of the Russians to apply basic military tactics left much of their armor without infantry support. The result was that Ukrainian forces were highly effective in the destruction of Russian tanks.\n\nHow the liberation of Irpin took place\n\nAfter arriving in Irpin, Dansky\u2019s platoon began to advance along with a collection of other units. Each day, step by step, they moved forward until the city was completely liberated. In his eight years of fighting, Dansky said he had never encountered such intense artillery fire from the enemy.\n\n\u201cThe Russians got stuck in the buildings. They shot or burned our equipment. But the main problem was that they beat us very hard with artillery, mines, grenades, everything. \u201cIn the first 4 hours when we arrived, they fired 260 shells. We counted. Our artillery could not fire so actively at the Russians, because there were civilians everywhere. The Russian military was not worried at all about civilian casualties or destruction. We had to fight against enemy infantry and also against their armored vehicles. The enemy used tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and even light self-propelled guns in Irpin.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nThe heaviest final battles took place in the area of Hostomel Highway and the military hospital on the northern outskirts of the city. At that time the Russian occupation of Irpin was coming to an end.\n\n\u201cAt the crossroads we met enemy infantry, when they saw our tanks gathered in one place. They were about 54 yards away and started running away after we opened up on them. The Russians left behind many weapons and equipment that will now work against them. And they also left evidence of their robberies. In places where there should be infantry gear used for fighting, we found many stolen things. They were purely looters, taking things to sell back home.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nElite Russian forces in Irpin\n\nThe city was occupied by elite units of the Russian army. Soldiers of the 106th and 98th Airborne Divisions, the 76th and 31st Airborne Assault Divisions, and the Black Sea Fleet Marines were spotted there. These troops are the best trained and equipped units of the Russian army. It was their job to quickly capture the suburbs of Kyiv and storm the capital. But the Ukrainian people stopped their invasion and forced them to retreat.\n\n\u201cWe saw these so-called elite troops flee very quickly. After we came in and advanced on their positions, they immediately ran away. They did not want to die, they were afraid. We were ready to stand to the end, because this is our land,. It will be liberated. Everything will be liberated, both Crimea and Donbas.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nMurders of citizens and destruction of buildings\n\nMost Irpin residents were evacuated in late February and early March. But from the first days of spring, it became dangerous to leave the city alone, outside the humanitarian corridors. During the month of March, while the fighting continued, locals were evacuated in groups over a pedestrian crossing under the destroyed bridge to Romanivka. The efforts took place under fire and at risk of death. After the destruction of the railways, it was the only way to leave Irpin, all other areas were shelled and controlled by the enemy.\n\nBut several thousand people remained in the city during that time, in all areas including the occupied ones. For a month they lived almost without communication, without electricity, no gas, no water, and no heat. They practically did not leave their basements, because they risked their lives to go outside and look for supplies. But many did go out, and became victims of Russian war crimes. Many eyewitness accounts from surviving residents have been collected, about shootings and rapes by Russians. Ukrainian soldiers also saw evidence of those crimes when they entered the city, along with hundreds of boobytraps left behind.\n\nSome of the residents who remained in the city could not leave their sick relatives, some simply decided that it was safer to stay at home. Among them were the elderly. At the same time, the locals helped Ukrainian soldiers, and showed them the safe ways navigate around Irpin.\n\nOnly a few days after the city\u2019s liberation did local authorities and police have the opportunity to pick up and bury the dead. But it was a slow process because occupation forces had left numerous mines, particularly on bodies.\n\nMost of the houses in the city were damaged or destroyed. According to Irpin\u2019s Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, who headed the Irpin Territorial Defense and was in the city all the time helping the townspeople, the western suburbs, the Synergy district with new buildings, and the BKZ district bordering Bucha, all suffered the most damage. The new building in the area of Hostomel Highway were severely damaged from the fighting. Thousands of private estates in all parts of the city were looted and destroyed, along with schools and businesses.\n\nIrpin has started the slow process of cleaning up after war and is in the process of coming back to life. Despite all the attempts by Russian forces to wipe out the town, it remained defiant and victorious. Irpin was awarded the title of \u201cHero City\u201d for stopping the Russian advance, and for its sacrifice. All the artillery shells, rockets, and bombs that fell on Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel could fall on Kyiv.",

            "text": "NATO allies have condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine in one voice. However, divisions persist on matters of energy trade and the extent of sanctions to be imposed on Moscow.\n\nHowever, in an astounding revelation, it has been learned that some NATO allies have been covertly supplying arms to Russia.\n\nAccording to an EU report, France and Germany provided Russia with \u20ac273 million ($295.4 million) in military hardware that is now likely being used in Ukraine, English Daily Newspaper The Telegraph has revealed.\n\nDespite an EU-wide embargo on arms supplies to Russia imposed in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the two powerful NATO allies delivered bombs, rockets, missiles, and guns to Moscow.\n\nBoth France and Germany were mediating between Russia and Ukraine after the Crimean annexation under the Minsk Agreement.\n\nAfter it was discovered that at least ten member states exported around \u20ac350 million ($378.6 million) in hardware to Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, the European Commission was compelled to close the loophole.\n\nGerman and French companies accounted for 78 percent of the total military export.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier accused former leaders of France and Germany, Nicholas Sarkozy and Angela Markel for giving concessions to Russia and denying Ukraine an opportunity to join NATO, France 24 had reported.\n\nHe was speaking at the anniversary of the 2008 NATO meeting in Bucharest, where it was first promised a membership.\n\nAbout eight years ago, the EU outlawed the direct or indirect sale, supply, transfer, or export to Russia of arms and related material of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment, and spare parts.\n\nHowever, despite the prohibition, countries were able to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment to Russia taking advantage of a loophole that allowed contracts signed before August 1, 2014, or subsequent contracts that would help close those agreements, to continue.\n\nHow France and Germany Befooled The EU\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has shown reluctance in arming Ukraine with high-powered and lethal weapons for fear of retaliation from Russia. However, the European community which is already mobilizing cutting-edge equipment for Ukraine is unconvinced.\n\nUnder pressure, Germany had to pull the plug on the Nord Stream II pipeline but it now seems to be drawing a line.\n\nCriticism of Berlin has grown tremendously after it was revealed that German companies had used a loophole in an EU embargo on arms exports to Russia, selling \u201cdual-use\u201d equipment to Moscow for \u20ac121 million ($130.1 million), including guns and special protection vehicles.\n\nUkrainian ambassador to Germany accused Berlin of arming Russia while refusing to send military equipment to Ukraine. In 2020 alone Germany sold \u20ac366 million of dual use goods to Russia. These can be used for military purposes. German policy in the Ukraine crisis is shameful. \u2014 Alan Sked (@profsked) February 13, 2022\n\nInterestingly, Germany had earlier taken advantage of the loopholes in the EU embargo regime against China to supply MTU engines for its submarines. It was not too long ago that it clarified that it was not doing any business with China anymore, as previously observed by the EurAsian Times.\n\nBerlin justified its use of an ambiguity in the EU\u2019s 2014 arms embargo, saying that the products were only delivered after the Kremlin promised they would be used for civilian purposes rather than military ones.\n\nOn the other hand, as part of 76 export licenses, France was also determined to be liable for shipments worth \u20ac152 million ($164.4 million) to Russia. Using a loophole in the EU embargo, Paris permitted exporters to complete contracts signed before 2014.\n\nAlong with bombs, rockets, and torpedoes, French companies delivered thermal imaging cameras, as well as navigation systems for fighter aircraft, attack helicopters and Russian tanks.\n\nSince the Russian invasion began on February 24, the EU has imposed additional limitations on dual-use item exports to Moscow, effectively shutting the loophole. However, the exemption on previously agreed-upon weaponry sales to Russia was not revoked until the bloc\u2019s fifth package of sanctions.\n\nWhen it became clear that weapons were still flowing into Russia, envoys from Poland and Lithuania worked to alter the original 2014 arms embargo language earlier this month.\n\nAccording to data from the European Commission, EU members sold Russia \u20ac39 million ($35.7 million) in weaponry and ammunition last year as the Kremlin prepared for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCountries often cite the \u201cGrandfather Clause\u201d to evade the embargos set by organizations, something that France has chosen as an escape from this situation. A grandfather clause is a provision that allows an old rule to apply to some current instances while a new rule applies to all future cases.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that France goes to the second round of polling soon and these revelations might have some impact on the voting patterns across the French population.\n\nNATO Divided Over Russia?\n\nEven though NATO countries have unanimously condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Russia\u2019s use of brute force and war crimes, there is no perfect agreement among the allies on the extent of sanctions that should be imposed on Russia.\n\nSome countries like Hungary have openly stated that they would not support more sanctions on Russia that would dent its own economy.\n\nFurther, even as the US, the UK, Canada and Australia have completely banned oil purchases from Russia, several European countries have continued to buy the Russian oil which has led to an uptick in supply. However, this could be expected to be sized down in the coming days.\n\nThe fact that France and Germany chose to supply arms to Russia despite largely acknowledging the insurgency fueled by Russia in the Donbas region is telling of Moscow\u2019s role in international integration, trade and defense relationships. However, these same weapons would now be used by the Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nTobias Ellwood, the chairman of the Commons defense committee, believes that at the June NATO meeting in Madrid, all member states should announce that they will not be transferring armaments to Russia.\n\n\u201cIf we agree Russia now presents an existential threat to European security, then there is no excuse for any European country to continue supplying Russia arms,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Russian assault in the Donbas region has intensified manifold in the last few days as it prepares to seize the region from Ukraine. Even as military aid keeps pouring from some NATO states, there is a challenge for the allies to put their own house in order and ensure consensus to avoid public embarrassment and Ukraine\u2019s ire.",

            "text": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces called in airstrikes on a besieged steel factory in the southern city of Mariupol to try to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops holding out in the strategic port, Ukrainian officials said Sunday, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would meet in Kyiv with two top American officials.Zelenskyy gave few details about the logistics of his planned talks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on what was the 60th day since Russia invaded Ukraine. But he told reporters he expected the Americans to come bringing \"not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons.\"The visit would be the first to Ukraine's capital by high-level U.S. officials since the invasion began Feb. 24. While visiting Poland in March, Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil to meet with the country's foreign minister. Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a U.S. leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris.The meeting was set to take place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter, an occasion Zelenskyy highlighted the allegorical significance of to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\"The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!\" he said, speaking Sunday from the ancient St. Sophia Cathedral.Russia has been trying to take Mariupol for nearly two months, and the city on the Sea of Azov has seen some of the war's worst deprivations. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014.Some 2,000 troops have been fighting tenaciously to hold on to the last remaining Ukrainian outpost in the city, the Azovstal steel plant, which also has civilians taking refuge in its labyrinthine tunnel system.Russian forces have continued to pummel the plant, hitting it with air strikes, including by long-range aircraft, Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesman for the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff, said Sunday.Mariupol has been blockaded for most of the war. Ukrainian officials have said they expect to find thousands of dead civilians and evidence of war crimes there when the fighting ends. Satellite images have shown what appear to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol.In the last day, Russia also pressed its attacks elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war and the Russians are aiming to gain full control over Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland.Shtupun said Russian forces intensified their assault operations toward the cities of Popasna and Siverodonetsk in Luhansk, and Kurakhiv in Donetsk. Luhansk regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that eight people were killed and two others were wounded in a Russian barrage on Saturday.The Russians also have shelled the Dnipro region west of Donbas, where at least one person was killed by a Russian missile, according to regional Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko.Russia has pulled back forces from Kyiv, and the north of the country to feed into the Donbas offensive, but the British Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week.\"Despite Russia making some territorial gains, Ukrainian resistance has been strong across all axes and inflicted significant cost on Russian forces,\" the ministry said in an intelligence update.\"Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,\" it said.In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. A 3-month-old baby was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, officials said. Zelenskyy said 18 more were wounded.\"The war started when this baby was one month old. Can you imagine what is happening?\" Zelenskyy said. \"They are just bastards. ... I don't have any other words for it, just bastards.\"The Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.The command post was hit on Friday, killing two generals and critically wounding another, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency said in a statement. The Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.If true, at least nine Russian generals have been killed since the start of the invasion, according to Ukrainian reports.On Saturday the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the Mariupol steel plant, released a video of around two dozen women and children sheltering there. Its contents could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians trapped underground there.The video shows soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl said she and her relatives had \"seen neither the sky nor the sun\" since they left home Feb. 27.The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told the AP the video was shot Thursday. The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed by far-right activists in 2014 at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and has elicited criticism for some of its tactics.More than 100,000 people - down from a prewar population of about 430,000 - are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city.Yet another attempt to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol failed Saturday. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organized buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 141 miles to the northwest.",

Click here for updates from April 22.\n\nRussia Destroys US and EU Weapons Delivered to Ukraine, Moscow Says\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said it used high-precision missiles on Saturday to destroy a logistics terminal in the Black Sea port city of Odesa where a large number of weapons supplied by the United States and European nations were being stored.\n\nIt also said Russian forces had killed up to 200 Ukrainian troops and destroyed more than 30 vehicles on Saturday.\n\nIn Odesa, at least eight people were killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings, and two more were destroyed on Saturday, the Ukrainian armed forces said.\n\nThe death toll could not be independently verified. The last big strike on or near Odesa was in early April.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin to Visit Kyiv and Hold Talks with Zelenskyy\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said Saturday.\n\nThe U.S. top diplomat and Pentagon chief will hold talks with Zelenskyy and discuss what kinds of weapons are to be provided to Ukraine to confront the Russian offensive, the Ukrainian leader said during a press conference.\n\nThe visit was announced after President Joe Biden add an extra $800 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nRussia Investigates Media Report on Presence of British SAS Special Forces in Ukraine\n\nRussia\u2019s top state investigative body said on Saturday it was looking into a Russian media report alleging that sabotage experts from Britain\u2019s Special Air Service (SAS) have been deployed to western Ukraine.\n\nThe SAS is an elite military force trained to conduct special operations, surveillance, and counter-terrorism. Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti news agency on Saturday quoted a Russian security source as saying about 20 SAS members had been sent to the Lviv region.\n\nIn a statement, the Investigative Committee said it would follow up on the report that they had been sent in \u201cto assist the Ukrainian special services in organizing sabotage on the territory of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe British Ministry of Defense had no immediate comment on the Russian investigation in response to a Reuters request.\n\nBritain said it sent military trainers to Ukraine earlier this year to instruct local forces in using anti-tank weapons but the British government said on Feb. 17\u2014a week before Russia\u2019s invasion\u2014that it had pulled out all troops except those needed to protect its ambassador.\n\nIt was not clear what steps the Investigative Committee planned to take in response to any SAS involvement in Ukraine. But the investigation into the possible presence of forces from a NATO country is significant, given that Russia has issued warnings to the West not to get in the way of its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine.\n\n___\n\nRussian Space Chief Warns of Possible Trigger for World War III\n\nAn attack against a spacecraft could usher in the next global war, Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia\u2019s national space agency Roscosmos, said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cOne must keep in mind that the destruction of a foreign spacecraft means World War III. It\u2019s a casus belli, and there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Rogozin said, using a Latin term for a formal legal reason to start a war.\n\nRogozin was commenting on Washington\u2019s decision to stop conducting anti-satellite missile tests. Announcing the move on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris called the destruction of satellites during such tests \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d because it leaves dangerous space debris.\n\nThe Roscosmos chief, however, argued that the United States is now \u201cpretending to be doves\u201d because it had already conducted all the necessary tests. \u201cThis move should, therefore, be strictly viewed as propaganda,\u201d he said.\n\nRogozin argued that the Boeing X-37, an unmanned U.S. shuttle-like spacecraft currently orbiting the Earth, could potentially be used for spying and carrying weapons of mass destruction. He said that a proposal by Russia and China to sign a treaty banning the placement of weapons in outer space was met with \u201cdead silence\u201d in Washington.\n\nThe stationing of weapons of mass destruction in outer space has been internationally banned since 1967.\n\n____\n\nGeneral Accuses Boris Johnson of Disclosing Military Secrets\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is \u201ctempting evil\u201d with his statements about the training of Ukrainian troops abroad amid the conflict with Russia, Polish General Waldemar Skrzypczak, who advises the defense minister, said on Friday.\n\nDuring a visit to India earlier this week, Johnson told journalists that \u201cwe are currently training Ukrainians in Poland in the use of anti-aircraft defense, and actually in the UK in the use of armored vehicles.\u201d\n\nSkrzypczak, who headed one of the multinational divisions in Iraq in the mid-2000s, told Polish newspaper Fakt that \u201cwhen we were on missions abroad it was hard to imagine that one of the politicians would talk about our plans or training on television.\u201d\n\nBy making the comments, Johnson \u201creveals military secrets\u201d to Russia, the general said. \u201cTraining is a military matter and must be kept under wraps. The man should \u2026 think before saying such things.\u201d\n\nThe former commander of Poland\u2019s land forces called the prime minister\u2019s behavior \u201cextremely irresponsible,\u201d warning that it could lead to \u201cdisastrous consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prime minister may not be aware of this, but with such statements he endangers the success of the entire military operation, as well as the safety of soldiers,\u201d Skrzypczak said.\n\n_____\n\nRussia to Deploy Sarmat Missiles by Autumn in \u2018Historic\u2019 Nuclear Upgrade\n\nRussia said on Saturday it plans to deploy its newly tested Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles by autumn.\n\nThe target stated by Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, is an ambitious one as Russia reported its first test-launch only on Wednesday and Western military experts say more will be needed before the missile can be deployed.\n\nThe Sarmat is capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads and decoys, and of striking targets thousands of miles away in the United States or Europe.\n\nThis week\u2019s test, after years of delays due to funding and technical issues, marks a show of strength by Russia at a time when the war in Ukraine has sent tensions with the United States and its allies soaring to their highest levels since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.\n\nRogozin said in an interview with Russian state TV that the missiles would be deployed with a unit in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, about 3,000 km (1,860 miles) east of Moscow.\n\nHe said they would be placed at the same sites and in the same silos as the Soviet-era Voyevoda missiles they are replacing, something that would save \u201ccolossal resources and time.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the \u201csuper-weapon\u201d was a historic event that would guarantee the security of Russia\u2019s children and grandchildren for the next 30 to 40 years, Rogozin added.\n\nWestern concern about the risk of nuclear war has increased since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 with a speech in which he pointedly referred to Moscow\u2019s nuclear forces and warned that any attempt to get in Russia\u2019s way \u201cwill lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJapan, Russia Reach Agreement on Fishing Quotas Amid Ukraine-Related Sanctions\n\nJapan and Russia have reached an agreement on Tokyo\u2019s fishing quotas for salmon and trout spawned in Russian rivers, despite Moscow\u2019s anger over the spate of economic sanctions that Tokyo imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nJapan\u2019s Fisheries Agency said Saturday that the two countries agreed on Tokyo\u2019s fishing quota of 2,050 tons of salmon and trout within its exclusive economic zone, with the agreement expected to be signed next week, Kyodo News reported.\n\nUnder the agreement, Japan will pay an annual cooperation fee of between 200 million yen ($1.56 million) and 300 million yen ($2.34 million) to Russia, depending on the eventual tonnage of the catch. A cooperation fee is paid to the country where the fish were spawned.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\nUkraine President Spoke With UK\u2019s Johnson About \u2018New Phase\u2019 of Military Aid\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson about a \u201cnew phase\u201d of military aid, including the provision of heavy weapons, the president\u2019s deputy chief of staff Andriy Sybiga said on Saturday.\n\nSpeaking on national television, Sybiga said the pair also talked about further financial support for Ukraine on the call.\n\n____\n\nZelenskyy: Allies Finally Delivering Weapons Kyiv Asked For\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday said allies were finally delivering the weapons that Kyiv had asked for, adding the arms would help save the lives of thousands of people.\n\nIn a late-night video address, Zelenskyy also said comments earlier in the day by a Russian commander about the need to link up with Moldova showed Moscow wanted to invade other countries.\n\n_____\n\nUkraine: Missile Attack Kills 5 in Odesa\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president says five people were killed in a missile attack in the Black Sea port city of Odesa.\n\nUkraine presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, provided the information Saturday.\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister earlier said Russian forces fired at least six cruise missiles at the city.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko said in a Telegram post on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were able to shoot down several missiles, but at least one landed and exploded.\n\n____\n\nUS Warns Russia of \u2018Astronomical\u2019 Nuclear Price\n\nRussia would pay an \u201castronomical\u201d price should its President Vladimir Putin order the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, said on Friday amid the ongoing Russian offensive.\n\nIn an interview for the Ukrainian outlet European Pravda, Nuland was asked to assess the possibility of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons. She responded that she could not rule out such a \u201ccatastrophic scenario\u201d as Putin \u201chas already ordered\u201d what, she alleged, were \u201cbrutal war crimes,\u201d and the world must be prepared for the worst. At the same time, Nuland stressed, the consequences of such steps would be catastrophic for Russia and for Putin personally.\n\nShe refused to provide any details about the potential response from the West, saying instead that use of nuclear weapons would take the situation to a \u201cfundamentally new level\u201d where the price will be \u201csimply astronomical.\u201d\n\nAsked by a journalist if Kyiv can rely on its Western partners\u2019 support in a worst-case scenario, Nuland reassured Ukraine that it would not be left alone. Meanwhile, the under secretary of state said, the United States would continue to provide Ukraine with military assistance. She revealed that Washington has begun supplying Kyiv with multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and would do its best to keep up with Ukraine\u2019s needs.\n\nNuland\u2019s strongly-worded warnings came just two days after the Pentagon said that at this point it does not see a need to change the country\u2019s nuclear posture. The U.S. Department of Defense spokesman\u2019s statement followed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s claims that Moscow could use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\n_____\n\nPentagon Seeking Info From US Industry on Ukraine-Ready Systems\n\nThe Pentagon is looking for new avenues for U.S. industry to accelerate production and build more capacity for proven, effective weapons that require minimal training and can be rapidly exported to Ukraine, according to a government website posting on Friday.\n\nThe Department of Defense posted a request for information on SAM.gov that had an initial response deadline of May 6 and sought information on weapons or commercial capabilities related to air defense, anti-armor, anti-personnel, coastal defense, counter battery, unmanned aerial systems, and communications like radios or satellite internet.\n\n______\n\nGermany Should Stop Sending Weapons to Ukraine: Public Figures\n\nFurther military aid to Ukraine would only lead to an uncontrollable escalation of hostilities and prolong the suffering of the people caught up in the fighting, a group of German politicians and public figures have warned Chancellor Olaf Scholz in an open letter. By providing arms to Kyiv, Germany and other NATO nations \u201chave de facto made themselves a war party,\u201d the letter published by the Berliner Zeitung on Friday has said.\n\nThe co-authors of the letter, which include the ex-vice president of the Bundestag, Antje Vollmer, and a former U.N. assistant secretary general, Hans-Christof Graf von Sponeck, have said that Ukraine has \u201cbecome the battlefield for the conflict between NATO and Russia over the security order in Europe,\u201d which is now waged \u201cat the expense of the Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\nIf the conflict is not stopped quickly, it will end up in \u201canother big war\u201d similar to Word War I, the letter warns, adding that this time nuclear weapons might be used, bringing \u201cwidespread devastation and the end of human civilization.\u201d Avoiding further destruction and escalation should be an \u201cabsolute priority,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe co-authors, who also include a former German MP, Norman Paech, as well as an ex-director of the Center for Conflict Research in Marburg, Johannes Becker, maintain that NATO\u2019s military support only delays a diplomatic solution, fueling the resistance of the Ukrainian army that \u201chas little chance of winning.\u201d Instead, steps to end the bloodshed must be taken, they argue.\n\n___\n\nRussia Reveals Crew Losses From Sunken Warship\n\nAt least one person was killed and another 27 are missing after the Moskva, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, sunk earlier this month, according to Russian state media.\n\nAnother 396 crew members were evacuated to nearby ships and sent on to Sevastopol, a city in Crimea, Russia\u2019s TASS news agency reported. The Russian government, as of Tuesday, had not previously acknowledged any casualties.\n\nThe Moskva, a guided-missile cruiser, sunk on April 14, though the cause remains disputed.\n\nUkraine says it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles, which sparked a fire that detonated stored ammunition. The Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns, and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had massive amounts of explosives aboard.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry, however, says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ammunition and the resulting explosions left the Moskva with structural damage. It says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port.\n\nPhotos and a short video clip emerged early Monday on social media showing the Moskva badly damaged and on fire in the hours before it sank. The images show the Moskva listing to one side, with black holes from possible missile puncture marks, and significant scarring just above the waterline on the port (left) side in the middle of the vessel. The Kremlin on Monday said it had seen the photos of the Moskva but that they could not verify them.\n\n_____\n\nUkraine: Russians Trying to Storm Steel Mill\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s presidential office says Russian forces are attacking a steel plant that is the last defense stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the strategic port city of Mariupol.\n\nOleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, said during a briefing on Saturday that the Russian forces have resumed airstrikes on Azovstal and were trying to storm it.\n\nArestovich\u2019s statement came two days after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the whole of Mariupol, with the exception of Azovstal, had been \u201cliberated\u201d by the Russians.\n\nPutin ordered the Russian military not to storm the plant and instead to block it off in an apparent attempt to stifle the remaining pocket of resistance there.\n\n____\n\nLviv Announces Curfew Starting Easter Night\n\nLviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy has announced a curfew starting on Orthodox Easter night.\n\nCiting \u201cnew intelligence,\u201d Kozytskyy said the curfew would run from 11 p.m. Saturday to 5 a.m. Sunday, and then every day between those hours until further notice.\n\nKozytskyy said the church leadership is in support of the decision and that all churches in the region will be postponing their Easter night services until the morning hours.\n\n____\n\nCivilian Evacuation Effort Set for Mariupol\n\nEfforts to evacuate civilians to safer areas will continue in Ukraine on Saturday, the country\u2019s officials said.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app there will be another attempt to evacuate women, children, and the elderly from the strategic port city of Mariupol, which has been besieged by Russian forces for weeks.\n\nThe Kremlin earlier this week declared that Mariupol has been \u201cliberated,\u201d with the exception of the Azovstal steel mill, the last pocket of resistance where Ukrainian troops are holed up.\n\nVereshchuk said that \u201cif everything goes according to plan,\u201d the evacuation in Mariupol will begin at midday on Saturday. Many previous attempts to evacuate civilians from the city have failed.\n\nThe governor of the eastern Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on Telegram that an evacuation train will depart Saturday from the eastern city of Pokrovsk. Residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland known as Donbas, will be able to take the train free of charge.\n\nIt will bring them to the Western city of Chop near Ukraine\u2019s border with Slovakia and Hungary, according to Haidai.\n\n_____\n\nUS Convening Talks on Ukraine\u2019s Defense Needs\n\nThe Pentagon says U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will convene a meeting next week in Germany of defense officials and military leaders from more than 20 countries to discuss Ukraine\u2019s immediate and long-term defense needs.\n\nThe Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said Friday that about 40 nations, including NATO members, were invited and that responses are still arriving for the session to be held Tuesday at Ramstein air base. He did not identify the nations that have agreed to attend but said more details will be provided in coming days.\n\nThe meeting comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a major offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe agenda will include an updated assessment of the Ukraine battlefield as well as discussion of efforts to continue a steady flow of weapons and other military aid, Kirby said. It will include consultations on Ukraine\u2019s post-war defense needs but is not expected to consider changes in the U.S. military posture in Europe, he said.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says Ukrainian Fighters \u2018Securely Blockaded\u2019 at Mariupol Steel Plant\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian fighters and foreign mercenaries had been \u201csecurely blockaded\u201d at the Azovstal steel plant where they have been holding out in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin had ordered his defense minister on Thursday to block off the vast Azovstal complex \u201cso not even a fly can get through\u201d rather than try to storm it.\n\nThe defense ministry also said Russia had hit dozens of targets in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions of Ukraine on Friday.\n\n\u201cAll remnants of the Ukrainian \u2018Azov\u2019 Nazis, together with foreign mercenaries from the United States and European countries, are securely blockaded on the territory of the Azovstal plant,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Nazis are ignoring our demands to release the women and children allegedly with them to travel freely in any direction.\u201d\n\nPutin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 with the stated aim of demilitarizing and \u201cdenazifying\u201d the country.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Says Shelling of Eastern Luhansk\u2019s Cities Intensifying\n\nAll the Ukrainian-controlled cities in the eastern region of Luhansk were being shelled by Russian forces on Saturday and the barrage was intensifying, the region\u2019s governor Serhiy Haidai said on television.\n\nHe claimed Ukrainian forces were leaving some settlements there in order to regroup, but that the move did not amount to a critical setback. Russia denies targeting civilian areas.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russian Forces Made No Major Gains in the Last 24 Hours\n\nRussian forces have made no major gains in the last 24 hours despite increased activity, as Ukrainian counterattacks continue to hinder their efforts, British military intelligence claimed on Saturday.\n\nDespite Russia\u2019s claimed conquest of the port city of Mariupol, heavy fighting continues to frustrate Moscow\u2019s attempts to capture the city, impeding their progress in the Donbas region, the Ministry of Defence claimed on Twitter.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the report.\n\n_____\n\nKyiv Accuses Moscow of \u2018Imperialism\u2019 After Russia Flags Interest in South Ukraine\n\nMoscow wants to take full control over southern Ukraine, a Russian general said on Friday, a statement Ukraine said gave the lie to Russia\u2019s previous assertions that it had no territorial ambitions.\n\nRustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district, was quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to Transnistria, a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Minnekayev\u2019s statement showed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was \u201cintended only as a beginning.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry said Russia\u2019s goal of the \u201csecond phase\u201d of the war is \u201csimply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine. Imperialism as it is.\u201d\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Jalina Porter declined specific comment on Minnekayev\u2019s statement but said Washington firmly supported Moldova\u2019s sovereignty and was \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about events on the ground. \u201cNo one should be fooled by the Kremlin\u2019s announcements,\u201d Porter said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment when asked if Russia had expanded the goals of its operation and how Moscow saw the political future of southern Ukraine.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says It Shot Down Ukrainian Fighter Jet in Kharkiv Region\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said on Saturday that its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet and destroyed three MI-8 helicopters at an airfield in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Ukraine regarding the Russian claims.\n\n_____\n\nG20 Cannot Function With Russia at the Table, Canada Claims\n\nThe Group of 20 major economies cannot effectively function as long as Russia remains a member, Canada\u2019s finance minister claimed on Friday after a week of protests against Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington.\n\nDiscord over Russia\u2019s presence at the meetings has been on display all week, with officials from the United States, Canada, Britain, and other Western countries staging walkouts three days in a row whenever Russian officials spoke.\n\nThe G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, who met in Washington on Wednesday, failed to agree on its traditional communique outlining economic policy goals as Russia blocked language condemning its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe IMF steering committee and the World Bank-IMF Development Committee also failed to issue joint statements.\n\n\u201cThe G20 can\u2019t function effectively with Russia at the table,\u201d Chrystia Freeland, Canadian minister of finance who is of Ukrainian descent, told a news conference with Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko in Washington.\n\nThe tensions have called into question the effectiveness of the G20, which includes Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, as well as China, India, Indonesia, and South Africa, which have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict.\n\nThis year\u2019s G20 host country Indonesia is still optimistic that progress can be made on a number of issues despite the tensions, Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cEven with a walk out, we all agree\u201d on the substance of work that needs to be done, Indrawati said.\n\nIndrawati said she is more focused on \u201cgrassroots\u201d technical work underlying issues such as strengthening a G20 common debt framework for poor countries, and creating a new financing mechanism for future pandemic needs, than issuing a communique at the present stage.\n\nWith other G20 finance meetings scheduled for July and October and a leaders summit in November, Indrawati said there was ample time to continue progress.\n\n\u201cIf there is no forum at all, then the world is going to be in a much worse place,\u201d with each country setting policy without regard for others.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says It Plans Full Control of Donbas and Southern Ukraine; Moldova Summons Russian Ambassador\n\nRussia plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine during the second phase of what it calls its special military operation, the deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district said on Friday, reported Russian news agencies.\n\nThe Interfax and TASS news agencies cited him as saying that full control of southern Ukraine would improve Russian access to Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transdniestria, which borders Ukraine.\n\n\u201cControl over the south of Ukraine is another way to Transdniestria, where there is also evidence that the Russian-speaking population is being oppressed,\u201d TASS quoted Minnekayev as saying at a meeting in Russia\u2019s central Sverdlovsk region.\n\nMoldova\u2019s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian ambassador to express \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the remarks.\n\n\u201cThese statements are unfounded and contradict the position of the Russian Federation supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of Moldova,\u201d it said on its website.\n\n\u201cDuring the meeting, it was reiterated that the republic of Moldova \u2026 is a neutral state and this principle must be respected by all international actors, including the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\n____\n\nUkraine: Russian Offensive Continues in East\n\nThe Ukraine military\u2019s general staff says that Russian forces continue their \u201coffensive operations\u201d in eastern Ukraine with the goal of defeating Ukrainian forces, establishing full control over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and securing \u201ca land route between these territories and the occupied Crimea.\u201d\n\nUkrainian forces in the past 24 hours repelled eight Russian attacks in the two regions, destroying nine tanks, 18 armored units and 13 vehicles, a tanker, and three artillery systems, the general staff said on its Facebook page on Saturday morning.\n\nRussian forces continue to partially block and shell Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, and are active in the area of Izyum, the update said.\n\nIn the strategic port city of Mariupol, Russian troops \u201ccontinue to blockade\u201d Ukrainian units in the area of the Azovstal steelworks, the last remaining stronghold, and \u201claunch air strikes on the city, including with the use of long-range aircraft,\u201d the post said, adding that an engineering unit arrived in Mariupol in order to demine the port infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nUN Chief to Meet Putin and Zelenskyy Next Week\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will visit Moscow next week to meet Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin and then head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nGuterres will head to Moscow on Tuesday and meet Putin as well as having a working meeting and lunch with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Eri Kaneko, Guterres\u2019 associate spokesperson, told a news briefing in New York on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe hopes to talk about what can be done to bring peace to Ukraine urgently,\u201d Kaneko said.\n\nHe will meet with Zelenskyy on Thursday, foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and staff at UN agencies to discuss the scaling up of humanitarian assistance efforts, the U.N. spokesperson\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nAldgra Fredly, Allen Zhong, CNN, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.",

According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, over 21,000 Russian soldiers have died since the start of the invasion (Western officials estimate the figure is closer to 15,000). Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have died, and the United States believes that 2,000 to 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers have perished in the war. This is in addition to the 14,000 ethnic Ukrainians and Russians who perished after the first Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Simply put, the war has been catastrophic.\n\nDespite these tremendous losses, the Ukrainians have stood their ground. Ukrainian forces have destroyed thousands of Russian tanks, aircraft, helicopters, and armored vehicles. They also sank the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Simply put, the Ukrainians have stalled Russian advances in the country. Except for Kherson, a city located just north of the Crimean peninsula, the Ukrainians have yet to lose a metropolitan center to the Russians.\n\nBut how long can the Ukrainians hold out?\n\nWhile the international community continues to aid Ukraine, the Ukrainians desperately need military assistance. The Ukrainian army and its volunteer battalions need bulletproof vests, helmets, boots, and ammunition. The country has also called for medical assistance so that hospitals can tend to injured combatants and civilians. Finally, Ukraine is in urgent need of funding; the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine have already surpassed $100 billion. A food crisis is also possible.\n\nGiven the devastation caused by the war, Ukraine\u2019s borders must remain open. Numerous forms of humanitarian, medical, and military aid have arrived in Ukraine by way of Poland. Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, has become a major hub for this effort.\n\nIf the international community continues to provide aid to Ukraine, then the Ukrainians can win the war. According to reports, Russia executed its invasion incredibly poorly, with casualties now mounting and much of its equipment destroyed. The losses are leading to a major decline in Russian morale.\n\nMeanwhile, half a million Ukrainians have returned to Ukraine to protect their homeland, and countless foreign fighters have traveled to Ukraine to help defend the country. Overall, Ukrainian morale is high. The Ukrainian military\u2019s persistence could force the Russians from the country, reminiscent of the Finns defeating the Soviets in the 1939-1940 war. Ukraine\u2019s resilience, economic sanctions, and the continued loss of Russian life could be enough to stop the Russian invasion.\n\nThe Russian incursion is also behind schedule. According to reports provided by the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, the Russian General Staff is dissatisfied with the progress of the invasion. Russian officials assumed they would capture Kyiv within four days, and the country within fifteen. Neither occurred.\n\nGiven the failed conquest in northern Ukraine and Russia\u2019s inability to penetrate Ukrainian forces near Kyiv, the Russians have now resorted to a two-front war. In the south, Russian forces are moving through the Crimean peninsula. They established naval superiority, captured the city of Kherson, and launched an offensive in Mariupol. In the east, the Russians entered the country through the controlled territories in Luhansk and Donetsk. The Russians have attempted to capture the major cities in the east, such as Kharkiv and Kramatorsk, but Ukrainian forces have kept them at bay. As a result, the Russians have resorted to shelling these cities, leading to the deaths of thousands of civilians.\n\nWhile Ukraine has stood its ground, new problems could emerge. The Russians have now recruited volunteers from Chechnya and Syria, and Russian president Vladimir Putin is also trying to coerce Belarusian president Alyaksandr Lukashenko to join the fight. Belarusian involvement could be catastrophic for Ukraine, as the distance from the Belarusian-Ukrainian border to Kyiv is only 140 miles. If the Belarusians were to invade northern Ukraine, this could turn the tide in Russia\u2019s favor. The Ukrainians have done well in holding the Russians at bay, but fighting against two armies would be an incredible challenge.\n\nIf Belarusian forces were to enter the war, they could try to disrupt the humanitarian corridor in western Ukraine. Belarusian forces would look to position themselves near the Polish-Ukrainian border. This would stretch the Ukrainian military and its volunteer battalions by forcing them to fight on another front. A new front for Ukraine would allow the Russians to make further advances in southern and eastern Ukraine. Understanding that the corridor with Poland is essential to Ukraine\u2019s survival, Ukrainian forces would need to combat the Belarusians so that the Ukrainians could receive humanitarian, medical, and defense aid from the international community. In other words, if the Belarusians establish a presence near the Polish-Ukrainian border, this would cut off aid to Ukraine.\n\nTherefore, the corridor to Ukraine must remain open, and the international community should continue to arm Ukraine. If Syrian and Chechen mercenaries join the fight, and if the Belarusians cut off the international community\u2019s supply chain to western Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s chances of winning the war will be significantly diminished. However, swiftly providing Ukraine with the lethal and nonlethal aid it needs will help it win the war. Time is of the essence.\n\nMark Temnycky is an accredited freelance journalist covering Eastern Europe and a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nImage: Reuters",

We are very dependent on Russian gas in Europe and there are not many alternatives to LNG,\" Rutte said.\n\nThe government will subsidize energy companies to fill its Bergermeer gas storage facility to 70% capacity by the end of the year.\n\nIt would also focus on energy-saving measures to reduce its demand for gas.\n\n\"We can achieve this by working hard on a mix of energy savings and sustainability, but it will also have to lead to the import of energy from other countries, including liquid natural gas,\" the Dutch leader said.\n\nRutte said his government would be negotiating supply agreements with other countries as soon as possible and that it planned to import significantly more liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the future.\n\nLavrov claims Russia-Ukraine talks have stalled\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said talks between Moscow and Kyiv have stalled, appearing to contradict his own negotiator.\n\n\"They (negotiations) have stalled now,\" he said after talks with his Kazakh counterpart in Moscow.\n\nVladimir Medinsky, who is Russia's chief negotiator with Ukraine, however, said he had spoken to his Ukrainian counterpart on Friday.\n\nHe said \"several long conversations\" took place without giving more details.\n\nEarlier this week, the Kremlin said Russia had submitted a new written proposal, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had neither seen nor heard about it.\n\nLavrov said he was under the impression Kyiv may not want to continue the talks.\n\n\"It is very strange for me to hear every day statements by various Ukrainian representatives, including the president and his advisers, that make one think that they do not need these negotiations at all, that they have resigned themselves to their fate,\" Lavrov added.\n\nWatch video 03:29 Ukraine says troops holding out in Azovstal plant: DW's Emma Chaze\n\nGermany 'not wobbling, but struggling to find its new values' amid Ukraine war\n\nFlorence Gaub, an analyst with the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS), spoke to DW about shifting security stances in Germany and Europe as well as growing criticism over Berlin's seemingly hesitant approach to arms deliveries.\n\nGaub said, \"It's not so much that Germany doesn't have these weapons \u2026 it needs weapons itself,\" noting Berlin is also concerned about the potential long-term, escalating impact of large-scale arms deliveries.\n\nGaub also spoke of Berlin coming to grips with a wholly changed political landscape in terms of its European leadership role, saying: \"It's no secret that German strategic culture since 1945 has been a culture very much along the lines of dialogue, finding \u2026 building bridges, cooperation, trade (\u2026) as long as the world was in line with these ideas, it was easy for Germany to be a leader. Now we are in a different world.\"\n\nGermany \"is not wobbling, but it's struggling to find its new values, its new core\" in this new situation, she added.\n\nThe analyst also referred to the overall European response to Russia's attack on neighboring Ukraine, saying: \"It's spectacular, to be honest. I mean, before Ukraine, Europe was very much in line with Germany's strategic culture, a continent, an organization actually, not just a continent, that was very much focusing on peaceful resolution of conflict, very non-military in nature \u2026 I think the big surprise here is not just the war itself, or the performance of the Ukrainians, but it's also how Europe managed to change its strategic direction basically overnight.\"\n\nWatch video 01:23 How divided is Germany over its support for Ukraine?\n\nFrance sending heavy weapons to Ukraine\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron says his country is sending heavy weapons to Ukraine, including a self-propelled howitzer and an anti-tank guided missile weapon system.\n\n\"After all, we are supplying considerable equipment, from the Milan to the Caesar to various types of weapons,\" Macron said, referring to the Milan anti-tank system and the Caesar howitzer.\n\nMacron told a regional newspaper 40 Ukrainian soldiers would be trained in France to operate the howitzers.\n\nUkrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have repeatedly asked European and NATO powers to provide heavier weapons, especially artillery.\n\nWatch video 03:26 Why is Germany not sending heavy weapons to Ukraine?

It said Russia had \"acknowledged that the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, Russia's Central Military District said it planned to seize Ukraine's south as part of the \"second phase\" of its military operation.\n\nOver 369,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Germany\n\nAt least 369,000 people fleeing the war have registered in Germany since Russia invaded on February 24, Germany's Interior Ministry said on Friday.\n\nThe precise number to register is 369,381, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed, adding that the actual number is probably much higher.\n\nUN says humanitarian law 'tossed aside,' documents 50 civilians killed in Bucha\n\nThe United Nations said Friday that 50 civilians had been killed in Bucha, some of whom by summary execution.\n\nA UN mission to the Kyiv suburb documented the killings.\n\n\"During a mission to Bucha on the ninth of April, UN human rights officers documented the unlawful killing including by summary execution of some 50 civilians there,\" said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for Michelle Bachelet, UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nBachelet, meanwhile, said on Friday that since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 \"international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored but seemingly tossed aside.\"\n\nThe UN says, in total, it has received more than 300 allegations of civilians being killed in the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, all under the control of Russian armed forces in late February and early March.\n\nAccording to the Geneva Convention, the killing of persons \"taking no active part in hostilities\" constitutes a war crime.\n\nWatch video 00:36 UN official in Ukraine: 'Mariupol is an unfolding tragedy.'\n\nAustralia adds Putin daughters to sanctions lists\n\nAustralia has imposed sanctions and travel bans on two daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has also been targeted, the Australian government said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe statement did not name the two relations of Putin but the president is known to have two adult daughters, Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova.\n\nThe fresh round of sanctions also targets 144 Russian senators.\n\nForeign Minister Marisa Payne added that Canberra will continue to increase the pressure on Moscow by targeting those who bear responsibility for the \"unjustified and unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.\"\n\nWatch video 02:19 Ukrainians' day-to-day lives of suffering\n\nRussian military aims for 'full control' of southern Ukraine, route to Trans-Dniester\n\nMoscow is planning to seize Ukraine's south and open a route to Moldova's Trans-Dniester region, as part of the \"second phase\" of its military operation, Russia's Central Military District (CFD) command said.\n\nIn a statement carried by TASS and Interfax, Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of the CFD, said Russia plans to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine, allowing it access to Trans-Dniester.\n\n\"Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Trans-Dniester,\" Minnekayev said. He then claimed there was evidence of \"oppression\" of the Russian-speaking population there.\n\nRussia had previously used claims of oppression of Russian minorities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine as grounds for military action.\n\nA pro-Russian regime has de facto ruled the breakaway republic of Trans-Dniester since the 1990s, with support from Russian troops.\n\nKyiv has previously warned that Russia may use the region to launch attacks into western Ukraine, potentially surrounding Ukrainian forces in the south of the country, especially around the Odesa region.\n\nMariupol mayor pleads for evacuations but top official says routes too dangerous\n\nThe mayor of Mariupol has pleaded for the \"full evacuation\" of the southern city, but Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said there \"will be no humanitarian corridors\" in the country on Friday.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said \"about 100,000 people remain\" in the city, which President Vladimir Putin says is now controlled by Russian forces, a claim Ukraine denies.\n\nHowever, Deputy PM Vereshchuk said it would be too dangerous for civilians to leave on Friday.\n\n\"Because of the insecurity along the routes, there will be no humanitarian corridors today, April 22,\" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nWatch video 03:40 Russia claims victory in Mariupol\n\nUK: Russia wants to free up troops by not storming Mariupol steel plant\n\nIn an intelligence update on the Ukraine conflict, the UK suggested \"Putin's decision to blockade the Azovstal steel plant likely indicates a desire to contain Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol and free up Russian forces to be deployed elsewhere in eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin previously said it was unnecessary to storm the industrial zone containing the plant.\n\n\"A full ground assault by Russia on the plant would likely incur significant Russian casualties, further decreasing their overall combat effectiveness,\" the UK Ministry of Defense posted on Twitter.\n\nThe statement also said that despite Russia's \"renewed focus they are still suffering from losses sustained earlier in the conflict. In order to try and reconstitute their depleted forces, they have resorted to transiting inoperable equipment back to Russia for repair.\"\n\nHeavy shelling is continuing in the Donbas region as Russia seeks to advance towards settlements, including Krasnyy Lyman, Buhayikva, Barvinkove, Lyman and Popasna, the ministry said in its regular bulletin.\n\nZelenskyy: Russia planning independence 'referendum' in Ukraine's south\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of planning to \"falsify\" a \"referendum\" in parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions that are under Russian control. The regions are located to the north of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nZelenskyy urged residents in these areas not to provide their passport numbers or other personal information to Russian forces.\n\n\"This is not to help you ... This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nMoscow has either orchestrated or supported several similar votes in contested areas of Ukraine in recent years, holding a referendum in Crimea after occupying the territory in 2014 and later supporting independence votes held by pro-Russian separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nLuhansk and Donetsk later declared themselves independent \"people's republics,\" a status soon supported by Russia. The two regions are officially recognized as Ukrainian territory by almost every country in the world, despite being under control of the separatists since 2014.\n\n\"Any 'Kherson People's Republics' are not going to fly,\" Zelenskyy said, alluding to the entities established by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\n\"If someone wants a new annexation, it can only lead to new powerful sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nWatch video 26:00 Can the West ever deal again with Putin?\n\nUkraine's Zelenskyy: Mariupol 'continues to resist'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Mariupol \"continues to resist\" despite Moscow's claim to have captured it.\n\n\"In the south and east of our country, the occupiers continue to do everything to have a reason to talk about at least some victories,\" he said in a video address.\n\n\"They can only delay the inevitable \u2014 the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory, in particular Mariupol, a city that continues to resist Russia, despite everything the occupiers say.\"\n\nUN refugee agency: Situation around the world worsening amid Ukraine war\n\nThe UN High Commission for Refugees (UNCHR) said on Friday that the situation of refugees has further worsened due to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"The conflict has further worsened the situation of many of the approximately 84 million displaced people on earth, as food has already become scarcer and significantly more expensive worldwide,\" the acting UNHCR office manager in Germany, Roland Bank, said in remarks published by Germany's Funke Media Group.\n\nBank added that millions of people had already lost their incomes due to the pandemic.

This is where German development cooperation can help in the short term,\" Shulze told Augsburger Allgemeine. \"My ministry has reallocated funds for this via an emergency program.\"\n\nGermany will provide \u20ac37 million (\u20ac40.1 million) for reconstruction in Ukraine, the paper went on to say citing ministry sources.\n\nAround \u20ac22.5 million would go to the reconstruction of Ukraine's power grid, while the remainder would go to the rebuilding of apartments as well as for the acquisition of medical equipment.\n\nWatch video 03:50 US public broadly supports military help for Ukraine: DW's Sumi Somaskanda\n\nZelenskyy: Russia turned down Easter truce offer\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia rejected a proposal for a cease-fire over the Orthodox Christian Easter period.\n\n\"This very well demonstrates how the leaders of this state actually treat the Christian faith, one of the most joyful and important holidays,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"But we keep the hope.

It is sad that in these days that are the holiest and most solemn for all Christians, the deadly clamor of arms is louder than the sound of bells announcing the Resurrection.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Switzerland has rejected two requests by Germany to export Swiss ammunition to Ukraine, citing the Alpine nation\u2019s strict neutrality.\n\nThe decision was first reported Sunday by Swiss weekly Sonntagszeitung.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs confirmed that \u201cboth requests from Germany, whether the ammunition received from Switzerland can be passed on to Ukraine, were answered negatively with a reference to Swiss neutrality.\u201d\n\nGermany needs Switzerland\u2019s consent for the arms delivery as part of the original sale contract. The Swiss office declined to specify what type of ammunition Germany had sought to export to Ukraine.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian military says it has struck a Ukrainian explosives factory, several artillery depots and hundreds of other targets.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Sunday that the Russian military used precision-guided missiles to destroy a factory making powder and explosives near Pavlohrad in the Dnipro region in central Ukraine.\n\nKonashenkov said Russian forces also struck several depots with artillery munitions and rockets in Barvinkove, Nova Dmytrivka, Ivanivka, Husarivka and Velyka Komyshuvakha in the Kharkiv region.\n\nHe added that the Russian artillery hit 423 Ukrainian targets overnight, including fortified positions and troops concentrations, while Russian warplanes destroyed 26 Ukrainian military targets.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nISTANBUL \u2014 The spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians has called for the opening of humanitarian corridors in Ukraine, saying a \u201chuman tragedy\u201d was unfolding in the country.\n\nEcumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I spoke Saturday night in Istanbul during midnight mass marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ ahead of Orthodox Easter Sunday.\n\n\u201cLet us ask the Risen Redeemer that this year, (Easter) will be the impetus to open humanitarian corridors, safe passages to truly safe areas for the thousands of people surrounded in Mariupol, civilians, among them the wounded, the elderly, women and many children,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cThe same applies to all other regions of Ukraine, where an indescribable human tragedy is unfolding.\u201d\n\nIstanbul-based Bartholomew is considered first among equals among Eastern Orthodox patriarchs, which gives him prominence but not the power of a Catholic pope.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBERLIN \u2014 The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe says it is extremely concerned about the detention of several Ukrainian members of its monitoring mission in the east of the country.\n\nThe Vienna-based body said in a brief statement Sunday that it is \u201cusing all available channels to facilitate their release.\u201d A spokesperson declined to specify how many national mission members were detained, when or by whom.\n\nSeveral OSCE observers have been killed or injured since the body\u2019s 57 participating states established a mission to monitor the conflict in eastern Ukraine eight years ago. Russia recently vetoed an extension of the mission.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken of hope and victory for his nation during an Easter Sunday address.\n\nSpeaking from the ancient St. Sophia cathedral, Zelenskyy said that \u201cthe great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cthe Lord and the holy heavenly light are on our side,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are going through very difficult ordeals. Let us reach a just end on this path \u2014 the beginning of a happy life and prosperity of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy said that \u201con Easter, we ask God for great grace to make our dream come true \u2013 this is another great day \u2014 the day when great peace will come to Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 A Ukrainian presidential adviser has urged Russia to allow civilians to leave a steel mill in Mariupol besieged by the Russian forces.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appealed to Russia to announce a truce in Mariupol on Orthodox Easter Sunday and immediately open a humanitarian corridor for civilians holed up at the giant Azovstal steel plant. He also challenged Russia to conduct a round of talks to negotiate an exit for the Ukrainian defenders of the plant.\n\nPodolyak tweeted that the Russian military is attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery barrage and is accumulating forces and equipment for an assault.\n\nSviatoslav Palamar, an officer with the Azov Regiment defending the plant, said in a video that on Eastern Sunday the Russians are continuing to shower the plant with bombs and shell it with heavy artillery.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military says Russian forces have continued to press their attacks in the east.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Sunday that the Russians fired on Ukrainian positions along the entire line of contact on the war\u2019s 60th day. It also said the Russian military intensified its offensive and assault operations in the Siverodonetsk, Kurakhiv and Popasna directions.\n\nA regional official in eastern Ukraine says at least eight people have been killed by the Russian shelling.\n\nLuhansk regional Governor Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that two others were wounded by the Russian barrage in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe General Staff added that Russian forces have also continued to pummel the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, hitting it with air strikes, including by long-range aircraft.\n\nThe shelling comes as the Russians are pressing their offensive in a bid to gain full control over Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland called Donbas.\n\nThe Russians have also shelled the Dnipro region west of Donbas, where at least one person was killed by a Russian missile, according to Dnipro regional Governor Valentyn Reznichenko.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian military intelligence agency posted a statement saying the command post was hit on Friday and two generals were killed and one was critically wounded.\n\nOleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in an online interview that 50 senior Russian officers were in the command center when it came under attack. He said their fate was unknown.\n\nThe Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said new evidence is emerging that shows Russian troops killed tens of thousands of civilians in Mariupol and then tried to cover it up. He said Ukraine has intercepted Russian conversations about \u201chow they are concealing the traces of their crimes.\u201d Satellite images have shown what appear to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nZelenskyy said the Russians set up \u201cfiltration camps\u201d near Mariupol for those trying to leave the city, which has largely been reduced to rubble. He said those who survive these camps are sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East. Many of them, he said, are children.\n\nHe said he spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday about the situation in Mariupol and the general course of the war.\n\nZelenskyy promised to find and punish those responsible for the missile attack on Odesa, which he said killed eight people and wounded 18.\n\nZelenskyy urged Ukrainians to observe a curfew and not attend Orthodox Easter services overnight. The lengthy services traditionally begin late Saturday and run through Sunday morning. \u201cBut starting from 5 a.m. you may go to the church in your city, town or community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSLOVIANSK, Ukraine \u2014 The sound of outgoing artillery and air raid sirens were heard Saturday in Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas that had come under Russian attack the day before.\n\nTwo servicemen were brought to a hospital from a nearby town, but one of them was mortally wounded and could not be saved.\n\nThe Russian strike early Friday had damaged several buildings, including a school.\n\nThe war has brought back painful memories for residents of Sloviansk, where in 2014 Ukrainian government forces repulsed Russia-backed separatists after a fierce battle. In the years since, the separatists maintained control over part of the Donbas, and Moscow has now set out to capture the entire region.\n\nAnna Direnskaya, 70, said she and her son and daughter-in-law decided to remain in Sloviansk.\n\n\u201cI lived through 2014. I was also here. I didn\u2019t go anywhere and I don\u2019t want to go anywhere. I am not hiding from myself,\u201d she said while sitting in a wheelchair outside her damaged apartment building. \u201cI want peace.\u201d\n\nDirenskaya, who like many in eastern Ukraine is a native Russian speaker, said she wishes the Russians would understand that Ukrainians are not bad people and there is no enmity between them.\n\n\u201cWhy did this happen? Why is this happening? I don\u2019t know. Tell everyone I want peace and quiet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s president says he will meet Sunday in Kyiv with the U.S. secretary of state and secretary of defense.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke of the plans Saturday during a press conference. He did not immediately share more detail about the visit from Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Saturday. The U.S. State Department also declined comment.\n\nZelenskyy has for weeks urged Western allies to send Ukraine more weapons to counter the Russian invasion.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland and Ukraine have signed an agreement increasing cooperation in the railway transport sector, aiming to help Ukraine maintain its trade exchange with foreign countries as the Russian invasion affects its ports.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Poland\u2019s premier, Mateusz Morawiecki, met on Saturday in Krakow, Poland.\n\nMorawiecki said on Facebook that they both agreed that current sanctions on Russia are insufficient, which can be seen by the condition of the \u201cRussian currency, bonds or inflation.\u201d They appealed to the international community for tougher steps that would stop Russia\u2019s aggression on Ukraine and for more military aid to help Ukraine.\n\nMorawiecki drew special attention to the plight of civilians seeking protection in a steel plant in Mariupol, as he called for the assistance.\n\n\u201cIn Mariupol soldiers \u2013 or rather Russian criminals want to make women and children starve to death. They are waiting until they run out of water. What kind of strategy is that? This is not war. This is genocide.\u201d\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9",

            "text": "Sergey Karaganov has served as a presidential advisor in the Kremlin both under Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin. He is still considered close to Russia\u2019s president and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. His recent proposals on Russian-speaking minorities in the \u201cnear abroad\u201d are known as \u201cPutin doctrine\u201d and Professor Karaganov, who is honorary chair of the Moscow think tank the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy, was first to come out publicly about an all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2019. President Putin has mentioned on Feb. 24 that Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO warrants Russia\u2019s military intervention to prevent it. However, Ukraine didn\u2019t even have a Membership Action Plan for NATO and Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz clearly stated accession was many, many years off.\n\n\n\nHow can an attack be justified on such grounds?\n\n\u00abFor 25 years people like myself have said that NATO expansion would lead to war. Putin said several times that if it came to Ukraine becoming a member of NATO, there would be no Ukraine anymore. In Bucharest in 2008 there was a plan of quick accession of Ukraine and Georgia to NATO. It was blocked by the efforts of Germany and France, but since that time Ukraine has been integrated into NATO. It was pumped up by weaponry and its troops were trained by NATO, their army getting stronger and stronger day by day. In addition we saw a very rapid increase of neo-Nazi sentiment especially among the military, the society and the ruling elite. It was clear that Ukraine had become something like Germany around 1936-1937. The war was inevitable, they were a spearhead of NATO. We made the very hard decision to strike first, before the threat becomes deadlier\u00bb.\n\nBut Ukraine was not about to become a member of NATO, not for at least many, many years. There was time to negotiate.\n\n\u00abWe have heard all kinds of promises by Western leaders throughout these 30 years. But they lied to us or they forgot about their promises. We were told at the beginning that NATO would not expand\u00bb.\n\nHow can you think a non-nuclear medium-sized country like Ukraine would ever attack a nuclear giant like Russia? And how can you think this is a Nazi country with a Jewish president elected with over 70% of the votes?\n\n\u00abUkraine was being built by the US and other NATO countries as a spearhead, maybe of aggression or at least of military pressure, to bring NATO\u2019s military machine closer to the heart of Russia. We can see now how well their forces had been preparing for a war. And Nazis were not only about killing jews. Nazism is about supremacy of one nation over another. Nazism is humiliation of other nations. The regime and the society in Ukraine were going very much like Germany in the 1930s\u00bb.\n\nYou say that NATO promised never to enlarge to the East and Russia was cheated on that. But former Warsaw Pact countries requested to be included in NATO themselves. And Russia signed up to the Founding Act on Russia-NATO relations in 1997, accepting NATO enlargement. No cheating there.\n\n\u00abIt was the biggest mistake of Russia\u2019s foreign policy in the last 30 years. I fought against it, because the Founding Act of 1997 legitimized further NATO expansion. But we signed it because we were desperately poor and we still were trusting in the wisdom of our partners. President Yeltsin probably thought that we would sneak between drops of rain, to no avail. As for NATO, it was formed as a defensive alliance. But when the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia was weak, I was shocked when I saw the rape of Serbia in 1999. Then we had an absolutely atrocious war in Iraq waged by most of the NATO members and then we had another clear-cut aggression in Libya, always by NATO. So we do not trust words. But we know that article 5 of NATO, stating that an attack on a NATO member is an attack to all, doesn\u2019t work. There is no automatic guarantee that NATO would come to the defense of a member under attack. Please read article 5 of the Treaty. But this enlargement is an enlargement of the aggressive alliance. It\u2019s cancer and we wanted to stop this metastasis. We have to do it by a surgical operation. I regret we were unable to prevent such an outcome\u00bb.\n\nWe all agree the Iraq war was illegitimate and was a very serious mistake. Corriere della Sera came out against that war at the time. But one grave mistake doesn\u2019t justify a second grave mistake. And the US people could elect a new leader, Obama, that was against the Iraq war and changed American policy. Can Russians have an opportunity to do the same?\n\n\u00abI don\u2019t think that in the foreseeable future we will have any change of power in Russia, because we are fighting a war of survival. This is a war with the West and people are regrouping around their leader. This is an authoritarian country and the leadership is always very attentive to the moods of the people. But I don\u2019t see real signs of opposition. Also, in the US or else nobody was really punished for the war in Iraq, so we have our doubts about the effectiveness of democracy\u00bb.\n\nYour parallels don\u2019t seem to match. In Libya, Ghaddafi was bombing protest demonstrations from the sky. NATO enforced a no-fly zone that had been called for by a UN Security Council resolution and Russia did not veto it.\n\n\u00abYes. At that time we believed the reassurances of our Western partners. But then we saw a clear-cut aggression devastating the country. That led us toward total distrust of Western countries, and especially of NATO\u00bb.\n\nAs for the intervention in Yugoslavia in 1999, it was made to stop a war that led to over 10,000 deaths and a UN tribunal charged Milosevic for war crimes, deportation and crimes against humanity.\n\n\u00abThe massive killings in former Yugoslavia happened after the NATO\u2019s rape of Serbia. People were killed on all sides. It was a civil war. It was an unspeakable aggression. And the Milosevic trial was a sad and humiliating show by petty people trying to rationalize their previous mistakes if not crimes\u00bb.\n\n\n\nIt was a UN tribunal, not a EU tribunal.\u00abWe don\u2019t acknowledge the right of that tribunal\u00bb.\n\nYou said that the real war now is against Western expansion. What do you mean?\n\n\u00abWe saw Western expansion happening, we see Russophobia in the West reaching levels like antisemitism between the world wars. So war was already becoming likely. And we saw deep pisions and structural problems within Western societies, so we believed that anyway a war was more and more likely. So the Kremlin decided to strike first. Also, this military operation will be used to restructure Russian elite and Russian society. It will become a more militant-based and national-based society, pushing out non-patriotic elements from the elite\u00bb.\n\nThe bottom line question is: Mussolini did not recognize the international order that emerged from the Versailles Treaty in 1919. Does the Kremlin recognize the legitimacy of the European order that emerged from the fall of the Berlin Wall? Do you think this order is legitimate?\u00abWe should not recognize the order that was built against Russia. We tried to integrate in it but we saw it was a Versailles system number 2. I wrote that we had to destroy it. Not by force, but through constructive destruction, through refusal to participate in it. But after the last demand to stop NATO was again rejected, it was decided to use force\u00bb.\n\nSo the overall goal of this war is to overturn the presence of NATO in central and eastern European countries?\n\n\u00abWe see that most of the institutions are, in our view, one-sided and illegitimate. They are threatening Russia and Eastern Europe. We wanted fair peace, but the greed and stupidity of the Americans and the short-sightedness of the Europeans revealed they didn\u2019t want that. We have to correct their mistakes\u00bb.\n\nIs the EU part of the institutions that Russia feels are illegitimate?\n\n\u00abNo, it\u2019s legitimate. But sometimes we dislike EU policies, especially if they become more and more belligerent\u00bb.\n\n\n\nYou seem to believe that an escalation of this war to other countries is inevitable. Is that what you are saying?\n\n\u00abUnfortunately it is becoming more and more likely. Americans and their NATO partners continue support of Ukraine by sending arms. If that continues, it is obvious that targets in Europe could or will be hit in order to stop lines of communications. Then the war could escalate. At this juncture it is becoming more and more plausible. I think the Joint chiefs of staff of US armed forces are of the same opinion as I am\u00bb.\n\nDenazification is what Ukraine seems to have proven by electing a Jewish president. Demilitarization is the opposite of what Mr. Putin has achieved, as this attack led Ukraine to get heavy weaponry from the West. Plus, Germany and the EU are rearming too, NATO has moved troops closer to Russia\u2019s borders, Western sanctions are now much tighter, while Europe and the US got closer together and Russia is becoming financially isolated. Would you say Putin\u2019s military operation is proving a success, so far?\n\n\u00abNazism is not only about antisemitism. It is about hating and suppressing all other nationalities. And it was taking over Ukraine. We never know how the military operations end. Demilitarization means destruction of Ukrainian military forces \u2013 that is happening and will accelerate. Of course, if Ukraine is supported with new weapons, that could prolong the agony. We can only talk about \u201cvictory\u201d in quotes, because there are many casualties on both the Russian and the Ukrainian side. The war will be victorious, in one way or another. I assume demilitarization will be achieved and there will be denazification, too. Like we did in Germany and in Chechnya. Ukrainians will become much more peaceful and friendly to us\u00bb.\n\nBut so far the Russian military had to withdraw after keeping Kiev under siege for one month. It doesn\u2019t look like the military operation is going so well, does it?\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s a large military operation, so it has secrets in the way it\u2019s waged. What if the Kiev operation was meant to distract Ukrainian forces and keep them away from the main theater in the South and South-East? Maybe that was the plan. Moreover Russian troops have been very careful not to hit civilian targets, we used only 30-35% of the lethal weapons that we could use. If we had used everything, that would have meant the destruction of Ukrainian cities and a much quicker victory. We did not do carpet bombing like Americans in Iraq. The endgame probably will be a new treaty, maybe with Zelensky still there. Probably it would mean the creation of a country in South and South-East Ukraine that is friendly to Russia. Maybe there will be several Ukraines. But at this juncture it is impossible to predict because, of course, it\u2019s an open-ended story. We are in the fog of war\u00bb.\n\n\n\nThere is clear evidence that civilians have been targeted and killed by the Russian in Mariupol, in Bucha and elsewhere. These look very much like war crimes and crimes against humanity and they were deliberate. Should they be persecuted?\n\n\u00abThe Bucha story is completely fake-staged, it\u2019s a provocation\u00bb.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look staged at all.\n\n\u00abI watched the pictures and I am 99% sure. But more in general there is a war and civilians suffer. We know that Ukrainian neoNazi forces have been using civilians as living shields, especially in Mariupol. We have different pictures with you\u00bb.\n\nIt\u2019s rather the opposite: the Russian army did not allow humanitarian corridors.\n\n\u00abWe opened them. They were blocked by nationalist forces. I know how our military operates but, of course, this is a war. We face a tragedy\u00bb.\n\nDid you expect this level of cohesion between Europe and the US?\n\n\u00abWell, the cohesion will collapse because of the problems of the West. But for the time being they were organizing even before this conflict. The West is failing and losing its position in the world, so it needs an enemy \u2013 for the moment we are the enemy. I don\u2019t think the unity will last, Europe will not commit the suicide by choosing to lose its independence. I hope our European neighbors will recuperate from this dizziness of hatred\u00bb.\n\nYou speak like some other country started this war, in fact Russia started it.\n\n\u00abI was not for this particular scenario, but it happened. And I support my country. The West committed several aggressions. We are now on the same moral level, we are equal, we are doing more or less like you. I regret that we lost our moral superiority. But we are fighting an existential war\u00bb.\n\nSanctions are getting tighter. Will Russia become more dependent on China?\n\n\u00abThere is no question about that: we will be more integrated and more dependent on China. It has positive elements but overall we will be much more dependent. I am not very much afraid of becoming a pawn of China like some EU states became pawns of the US. First, Russians have a core gene of sovereignty. Second, we are culturally different from the Chinese, I don\u2019t think that China could or would like to overtake us. However we are not happy with the situation, because I would have preferred to have better relations with Europe. But Chinese are our close allies and friends and the biggest source of Russian strength after Russian people themselves. We are a source of their strength. I would prefer to end this confrontation with Europe. My calculation was to create a safe Western flank to compete more effectively In the Asian world of tomorrow\u00bb.\n\nYou declared that China, not Russia, will emerge as the victor in this war. What did you mean?\n\n\u00abWe will be victorious because Russians always are in the end. But in the meantime we will lose a lot. We will lose people. We will lose financial resources and we will become poorer for the time being. But we are ready to sacrifice in order to build a more viable and fair international system. We are talking about Ukraine, but we really want to build a different international system than the one that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union and, in turn, is now collapsing. We all are sinking into chaos now. We would like to build Fortress Russia to defend ourselves from this chaos, even if we are getting poorer for this. Unfortunately the chaos could take over Europe, if Europe doesn\u2019t act according to its interests. What Europe is doing right now is absolutely suicidal\u00bb.\n\nIs that a threat? Don\u2019t you think nuclear deterrence still applies?\n\n\u00abI know that officially under certain circumstances the US could use nuclear weapons for the defense of Europe and they allegedly could fight for the defense of Europe against a nuclear superpower. There is a 1% chance this might happen, so we have to be careful. But if a n American president takes such a decision inviting devastating response it would mean he is insane\u00bb.\n\nThis war doesn\u2019t look sustainable, including for Russia. It can\u2019t go on for long. What are the elements to agree at least on a real ceasefire?\n\n\u00abFirst, Ukraine must be a completely demilitarized neutral country \u2013 no heavy arms, for whatever of Ukraine remains. This should be guaranteed by outside powers, including Russia, and no military exercises should take place in the country if one of the guarantors is against it. Ukraine should be a peaceful buffer, hopefully sending back some of the arms systems deployed in recent years\u00bb.\n\nUkraine needs security guarantees, it needs to be able to defend itself or it will not be a sovereign country anymore.\n\n\u00abI am sorry but Italy and most European countries cannot defend themselves either\u00bb.\n\nThey belong to NATO\u2026\n\n\u00abThey have been saving on security. That is how they got themselves into this awkward position that Europe is not considered to be a serious actor in the world. Switzerland and Austria are neutral, but are safe. So can Ukraine\u00bb.\n\nDo you realize that after what you just said, the debate in Italy will move towards investing more on defense?\n\n\u00abYou are welcome. One of the grave mistakes of the Europeans in the last decades is that they didn\u2019t invest in their security, under their ideal of eternal peace. But I think European nations should be able to defend themselves, because they have real threats coming from the South and the world is becoming a very dangerous place as international relations are collapsing. The question is more against whom Italy would like to arm. Against Russia? Well, that would be insane. But you need a more robust military force. You are living in a very dangerous place in the world. If you depend on America, you are selling out your own security and sovereignty because the Americans have their own interests\u00bb.\n\nThe EU seems to be moving towards cutting dependence from Russian energy \u2013 first coal, then oil and finally natural gas. Did you expect that?\n\n\u00abI hope you are not suicidal. Of course that would damage Russia, too, but Europe would undermine its economy and its social situation. I hope it will not happen, because you can calculate your own interests. If you don\u2019t want our coal, we will sell it somewhere else. If you don\u2019t want our oil, after a time and some losses, we will sell it elsewhere. And if you don\u2019t want gas, well, well, we can also eventually redirect it after some suffering. Russians support Putin at 81% now, people are ready for a rough period\u00bb.\n\nDo you think Italy and Europe could do something to broker a deal?\n\n\u00abNot easy, given the situation. But what they could do is try to stop this Russophobia, akin anti-semitism of the previous centuries, this satanization of Russia that would lead us eventually to a worse confrontation than we have now. Even Russian culture is being erased in Europe by a new cancel culture\u00bb.\n\nFrom our partner RIAC",

            "text": "The images suggest a civilian bloodbath in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. The Ukrainian government is holding Russian troops responsible. But Ukrianian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also pointing the finger at former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He invited her to Bucha, to see for herself \"what the policy of 14 years of concessions to Russia has led to.\"\n\nIt was 14 years ago, in 2008, that Merkel, together with France's then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, helped block NATO's membership invitation to Ukraine during an alliance summit in Bucharest. They saw it as a provocation to Russia.\n\nZelenskyy has called that decision a \"miscalculation\" that has led to Ukraine now \"fighting for our lives in the most horrific war in Europe since World War II.\"\n\nDespite the rejection, NATO allies did agree at the summit to an unspecified timeline for Ukraine, along with Georgia, to become members.\n\nWatch video 03:04 'Mood in Germany has shifted significantly' after Bucha atrocities\n\nNord Stream 2 despite Crimea\n\nMerkel's government continued to deny Ukraine weapons deliveries after Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. At the same time, Germany approved the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under the Baltic \u2014 which meant less gas potentially flowing through Ukraine, from which the country earns transit fees.\n\n\"How else should Moscow understand that than as a tacit acceptance of a violent border shift?\" said Henning Hoff, the executive editor of Internationale Politik Quarterly, a magazine from the German Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nGermany's EU partners, such as Poland, have also noted Merkel's silence on the issue.\n\n\"Ms. Chancellor, you have said nothing since the beginning of the war,\" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said. \"German policy in the last 10 to 15 years has led to today's Russia enjoying a strength based on its monopoly over the sale of raw materials.\"\n\nMerkel's successor, Olaf Scholz, has blocked important sanctions from the European Union, he added.\n\nWatch video 03:52 Should trade with Russia continue?\n\nForeign policy as self-deception\n\nThe criticism goes beyond the previous and current German chancellors. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's president and former foreign minister, has also been accused of cozy relations with Russia.\n\n\"The relationship was fundamental, even holy, regardless what happened,\" Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, wrote in the Tagesspiegel, a German daily. \"Even an unprovoked war makes no difference.\"\n\nIt is among the harshest criticism an ambassador has ever publicly leveled at a German official.\n\nThe last 30 years of German foreign, security and trade policies are being called into question. \"Much too much dialogue and much too little hardball with the Kremlin,\" Melnyk wrote.\n\nFormer Chancellor Schr\u00f6der has entertained the closest ties with Putin, but other former leaders are now in hot water over their policies of appeasing the Kremlin\n\n\"Every German government since Putin became president has signaled that a smooth relationship with Moscow is more important than the fate of Ukraine. This encouraged the Kremlin's attack,\" Stephan Bierling, a political scientist at the University of Regensburg, told DW.\n\nCritics, including the United States and EU countries, have noted that Germany's adherence to a policy of Wandel durch Handel (\"change through trade\") is not limited to dealings with Russia, but with China, too. They have warned that engagement without strings attached will not lead to the desired liberalization of these autocratic regimes.\n\nAdmitting mistakes\n\nSteinmeier has since admitted that many aspects of Germany's Russia policy were \"poor assessments.\" Sticking to Nord Stream 2 has cost the country credibility, he said, but it was impossible to know how Putin would act.\n\nThe second Chechen War, which was raging as Putin first assumed the presidency, was already evidence of his \"criminal, hypernationalist\" character, Hoff said.\n\nMerkel, in a statement through a spokesperson, has stuck to her decision to block Ukraine's NATO accession, which remains the general position of the alliance itself, even as many of its members send Ukraine weapons with which to fight Russian troops. That includes Germany, in a major reversal of policy not to supply weapons to parties actively involved in conflict.\n\nZelenskyy, Merkel, Macron, and Putin met in 2019 under the Normandy format to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine\n\nRoom for negotiation\n\nDespite the strong criticism, and calls to beef up the Bundeswehr, there remains interest in Germany's playing a diplomatic role. In negotiations with Putin, \"we need Chancellor Olaf Scholz's personal leadership,\" Melnyk told the news agency Reuters. \"This would be a litmus test for the new German foreign policy.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian ambassador has also expressed support for the Normandy Format, a peace initiative between France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, which began under Merkel and Melnyk said he wants to see Scholz continue.\n\nThat comes with one condition: The Ukrainians want to bring the United States into those talks, which so far the EU powers have been reluctant to do.\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Nothing special is happening there,\u201d he said, adding that restrictions might have some effect, but only in the long run.\n\nMorawiecki then called for \u201ccrushing sanctions \u2026 much stronger than those that have been imposed.\u201d The move comes as Washington and Brussels are reportedly discussing sanctions designed to hit Russia\u2019s energy sector. So far, Western nations have mostly targeted Russian finances and banking, while the EU has also banned Russia\u2019s coal imports.\n\nWhile the US introduced a total ban on energy from Russia, which was echoed by Canada, Australia, and Japan, EU member states have been split on the matter. Many European nations largely dependent on Russia\u2019s energy imports opposed an outright immediate ban on Russian oil and gas.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned in March that cutting off such imports immediately could cause \u201cmass unemployment, poverty, people who can\u2019t heat their homes.\u201d Austria admitted on Saturday that it simply cannot afford to ban imports of Russian gas.\n\nEven the US has been cautious about the possibility of an EU-wide oil and gas embargo against Russia, arguing it could drastically increase global oil prices and harm economies in Europe and beyond.\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.",

He was already scheduled to go to Moscow to see Putin and Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. On the trip, Guterres and staff members plan to discuss stepping up humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians affected by the war, the UN said.\n\nRussia Says 1 Dead, 27 Missing in Moskva Sinking (10:37 p.m.)\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry said one sailor died and 27 people remain missing after last week\u2019s sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet. Russia says the ship sank in a storm while it was being towed back to port after fires broke out on board.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military says the ship, whose normal crew was thought to be close to 500, sunk after being hit by Neptune missiles.

Michel, who chairs EU summits, believes Putin\u2019s entourage doesn\u2019t brief him fully about events, according to the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss confidential talks.\n\nMichel told Putin that the Russian leader had been wrong about his expectations that the war would last 48 hours, divide EU members and fail to trigger heavy economic sanctions. According to the Kremlin\u2019s readout, Putin reiterated Moscow\u2019s public line, criticizing what it called \u201cirresponsible statements of EU officials on the need to resolve the situation in Ukraine militarily\u201d and the bloc\u2019s \u201cignoring of numerous war crimes by Ukrainian forces.\u201d\n\nEstonia Wards Off Cyber-Attacks With Links to Russian Hackers (5:23 p.m.)\n\nEstonia has fended off a wave of cyber-attacks believed to be launched by a pro-Kremlin hacker group targeting Ukraine supporters. Around 700 million denial-of-service attacks mainly from outside of Europe were launched against the websites of the Estonian president, foreign ministry, police and public services agencies on Thursday and Friday, the Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team said.\n\nThe impact has so far been minimal, the authority said. The website of a NATO cybersecurity center in Estonia, which this week hosted a global exercise with 2,000 participants from 32 countries, was among the websites that were temporarily down. The pro-Kremlin hacker group Killnet has claimed to be behind the attacks, a military spokeswoman said on Friday.\n\nHalliburton Says It Must End Some Deals in Russia by May 15 (5:13 p.m.)\n\nHalliburton Co. said that sanctions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other nations require the company to wind down certain contracts in Russia by May 15.\n\nThe company also said that the total net book value of its assets in Russia is about $340 million, and warned the invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions could cause the company to take a charge related to those assets.\n\nEU Suggests Companies Should Keep Paying for Russia Gas in Euros (5:03 p.m.)\n\nThe European Union has suggested that companies could keep paying for gas in euros, as it published guidance that Moscow\u2019s decree calling for payment in rubles would violate sanctions.\n\nThe commission confirmed a preliminary assessment that the decree would run against European sanctions imposed on Russia. It also said the decree doesn\u2019t automatically preclude allowing companies to continue paying in euros, and the scope for exemptions is not yet clear. The commission advised companies to seek confirmation from Moscow that this was possible.\n\nU.S. Leaves World Bank-IMF Meeting in Protest as Russia Speaks (4:46 p.m.)\n\nOfficials representing the U.S., Germany, Japan, and other nations walked out of a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund gathering on Friday when Russia\u2019s envoy started speaking, the second such action at a high-profile gathering in Washington this week, people familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe representatives were attending a meeting of the institution\u2019s development committee, according to the people, who declined to be identified because the gathering is private. The committee is a ministerial-level forum of the World Bank and the IMF for intergovernmental consensus-building on development issues and has 25 members, usually ministers of finance or development, according to its website.\n\nRussia Faces \u2018Reverse Industrialization\u2019 Amid Sanctions (2:11 p.m.)\n\nRussia faces a deep and prolonged economic contraction along with higher inflation and reduced living standards, as sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies sap it of vital products and technology, according to economists at the central bank.\n\nIn its most detailed public statement on the outlook since the war started, the Bank of Russia warned that \u201cthe depth of the contraction may be quite significant and exit trajectory drawn out in time\u201d because the supply shocks triggered by sanctions are unlikely to fade quickly. It said Russia would experience \u201creverse industrialization\u201d as sanctions forced it to seek lower-tech replacements for western goods that were cut off.\n\nGeneral Says Kremlin Seeks Full Control of Southern Ukraine (11:04 a.m.)\n\nA top general said the Kremlin aims to secure control of the entire south of Ukraine as well as the eastern Donbas region, Russia\u2019s state-run Tass and RIA Novosti reported.\n\nMajor General Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Central Military District, spoke in Ekaterinburg. It\u2019s unclear whether his statements reflect official Kremlin objectives.\n\nRussia wants to create a land bridge to Crimea as well to influence key aspects of Ukraine\u2019s economy, including major Black Sea ports, he said. Ultimately the Kremlin wants access to Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria, which lies to the northwest of Odesa.\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "text": "\u00a9 Getty Images / simon2579 via RT\n\nMandelaw Bageru\n\nmandelawb@gmail.com\n\nFormed in the aftermath of World War II, NATO is a military alliance built on the principle of collective defense \u2014 meaning that all NATO countries agree to come to the defense of any individual member that comes under attack. Russia considers NATO to be a direct threat, and Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the possibility that Ukraine might join motivated his decision to launch the Russian invasion. Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry has also warned of serious military and political consequences if Sweden and Finland join the alliance. All these three countries are lately seeking to do that.\n\nSo is it worth provoking Putin and Russia to add Ukraine, Sweden, and Finland into the NATO alliance club? This issue requires serious look beyond the current hasty phobia-led and unequal political standing among nations.\n\nRussia\u2019s NATO-coerced invasion of parts of Eastern Ukraine has brought the dangerous likelihood of nuclear war into a new contemporary global political focus. Sadly, in response to the Russo-Ukraine protracted war crisis, many countries are opting to boost their respective military spending, much to the delight of weapons contractors and the arms industry. Even more alarming are the calls for increased investments in nuclear capabilities by nuclear-armed states, and the calls for deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons into countries that currently do not host them.\n\nIt is clearly known for generations how the four-pronged phobias have been causing inequality among global nations, simply rooted in erroneously perceived generalities of: (a) Russo-phobia, (b) Sino-phobia (c) Islam-phobia and (d) Afro-phobia. These phobic and irrational attitudes can easily trigger the jeopardy for nuclear bomb possibilities and the 3rd world war to occur suddenly.\n\nNuclear Bomb Proliferation and Flexing for Fight\n\nIt has been proven time and time again that on its own nuclear weapon can upset and/or destroy a city, by killing hundreds of thousands or even millions of people.\n\nFor instance, according to NukeMap:\n\nIf the largest Russian nuclear bomb were to be dropped on New York City, then over eight million people would be killed, and another nearly seven million injured. The U.S. already has an estimated one hundred nuclear weapons in Europe. Five NATO countries \u2014 Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Germany \u2014 take part in a nuclear sharing arrangement, each hosting twenty U.S. nuclear weapons. Germany, in addition to hosting U.S. nukes, is also ramping up its military spending to the tune of 100 billion Euros. In a major shift in German policy, the country has committed to spending more than 2% of its GDP on the military. Germany has also committed to buying US-made F-35 aircraft \u2014 jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons \u2014 to replace its own Tornado fighter jets. In Poland, a country that borders Ukraine and Russian ally \u2013 Belarus, does not have any nuclear weapons, yet, the leader of the ruling right-wing national-conservative Law and Justice Party says they are now \u201copen\u201d to the US putting nuclear weapons there.\n\nThe nuclear fever isn\u2019t just in Europe. China is accelerating its nuclear buildup amidst the rising fears of conflicts with the U.S.A \u2014 with Taiwan as a forthcoming flashpoint. On its part, China plans to build one hundred land-based nuclear missile silos, and a Pentagon report claims they\u2019ll have one thousand nuclear warheads by the end of the decade. This will add to the nearly thirteen thousand nuclear weapons that already exist globally. China is also nearing completion of its own nuclear triad \u2014 the ability to launch nuclear weapons by land, sea, and air \u2014 which, according to conventional wisdom, would secure its nuclear deterrence strategy.\n\nAdditionally, North Korea has restarted its ICBM program and recently launched a test missile for the first time since 2017. North Korea claims the missile to be a \u201cpowerful nuclear war deterrent,\u201d the same rationale every other nuclear-armed country uses for building and maintaining nuclear weapons.\n\nU.S. allies in the region aren\u2019t immune to the calls for nuclear weapons. Influential former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, who has long pushed for a more militarized Japan, recently called for the country to consider hosting U.S. nuclear weapons \u2014 despite Japan being the only place on Earth to know firsthand the horror wrought directly onto people by a nuclear-weapons attack. Luckily, the comments received pushback from current leader Fumio Kishida, who called the idea \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nBut too many leaders are not responsibly resisting the call for more nuclear weapons. Rather, neighboring countries to Russia like Finland, Sweden and others in the region are in hurry to be admitted into the NATO-Forces-Club in an attempt to squeeze Russia out of shape.\n\nOn his part, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, besides his calls for a No-Fly Zone, he recently told 60 Minutes: \u201cThe world is saying today that some people are politically hiding behind claims that \u2018we cannot stand up for Ukraine because there could be a nuclear war\u2026believing that by not helping Ukraine, you will hide from Russian nukes. I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019\u201d Zelensky appears to suggest that no matter if the West engages in a direct conventional military confrontation with Russia or not, a nuclear confrontation is a foregone conclusion. Zelensky\u2019s language that implies unavoidable nuclear attacks and a necessity for increased military intervention only pushes Russia closer to launching a nuclear attack \u2014 and the world toward a global nuclear war. This is not a path that Ukraine or the world should want to take. What is needed is more diplomacy.\n\nThe U.S. hasn\u2019t made things better. Instead, it is blatantly refusing to adopt \u201cno first use\u201d as official policy, the same nuclear policy shared by Russia \u2014 a policy that is striking fear across the globe right now, including majority of people in the U.S. who are now worried about a nuclear attack. This is doubly alarming considering the U.S.\u2019s history of fabricating evidence to go to war, as happened with George W. Bush\u2019s lies about WMDs in Iraq and the falsified Gulf of Tonkin incident that was used as a pretext to escalate the Vietnam War.\n\nCredibility of the Human Rights Council\n\nOn 7 April the UN General Assembly (GA) decided to suspend Russia\u2019s membership in the Human Rights Council. This hasty action establishes a destructive precedent not only for the future of the Human Rights Council, but also for the future of other United Nations institutions\u2019 existence and exercises around the globe. This biased action doesn\u2019t promote transparency. Rather, it challenges the idea that a few powerful countries can tank not only the Security Council initiatives but also the GA, without much is justified as a consensus or an explanation.\n\nObviously, this undigested hurried move was a big blow to Russia\u2019s prestige at the UN-forums, and adds bad precedence to the latent yet general atmosphere of Russo-phobia provoked by NATO pact hooligans. In the past we have seen similar collective actions imposed on a number of nations as well. This sets supremacy attitudes in the future in which unbalanced efforts will be made to exclude other countries from membership in the Human Rights Council too.\n\nIf the political trail is managed fairly, then, one could think of excluding several NATO countries or even NATO itself as an entity, for the war crimes and crimes committed against humanity by NATO forces during the wars of aggression against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and former Yugoslavia. Incidentally, one could think of excluding the UK for having extended its colonial arms invisibly through Saudi Arabia because of the protracted civil war committed in intensifying civil strife among ethnic groups in Yemen; or between Pakistan and India for its systematic war crimes and gross violations of human rights against the people of Kashmir, including widespread extra-judicial executions.\n\nAnother credible candidate for suspension would have been Azerbaijan because of its aggression against the unfortunate Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh during the Blitzkrieg of September-November 2020, where war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed, including torture and execution of Armenian prisoners of war. We could think of excluding for using its puppet regimes forcibly appointed in Colombia to carryout lethal para-military activities and consistent pattern of killing human rights defenders, social activist leaders, syndicalist and indigenous peoples.\n\nThus, it is not worth shedding popular tears over the UN Human Rights Council, whose authority and credibility are seriously jeopardized and still remain questionable; and whose resolutions are routinely ignored by many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel. Since its formation in 2006 the Human Rights Council has not served human rights well \u2013 but it has certainly served the geopolitical and informational interests of the global expansionist club members including, but not limited to, United States, the European Union, and the NATO alliance member countries.\n\nThe GA decision also puts a further nail on the coffin of the UN-General Assembly itself. It manifests how this Assembly can and is manipulated by the United States and by the bullying, arm-twisting and blackmailing practices of the Department of State. Countries have been overtly told to: \u201cTake the US-NATO way, or else, take the highway.\u201d\n\nFar more serious for the world are the economic sanctions and financial blockade imposed by the US and EU countries on Russia, which will have a long-lasting impact on the world economy, hurting the most vulnerable not only in Russia, but also in Europe, Africa, North and South America, and Asia.\n\nThe decision of the UN-General Assembly (GA) sets a dangerous precedent and further politicizes the Human Rights Council. One would think that precisely because some countries do not like what Russia is doing that they would like to \u201ctame\u201d it by involving it in the human rights work of the Council. Isolating a country is always counter-productive. What is needed is greater inclusion and greater debate \u2013 not exclusion and hate-mongering. In this respect, the GA vote illustrates the success of the \u201cinformation war\u201d that has been waged against Russia for decades \u2013 not just since 2022, not even since 2014 and the Maidan coup \u2013 long before there was systematic dis-information about Russia and a consistent negative narrative. This has a simple explanation: NATO has had no raison d\u2019\u00eatre since the Warsaw Pact was dismantled in 1991. In order to continue existing, NATO must have an \u201cenemy\u201d \u2013 and that is the only role that the US and NATO assigned to Russia. The Russian bogeyman is necessary and guarantees that the US military-industrial-financial complex can continue its war on the world and on the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n\nSignals Put Before the General Assembly\n\nThe allegations of war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces in Bucha in the vicinity of Kiev precipitated this move by the US to have Russia removed from the Human Rights Council. How much do we know about the events? While Ukraine accused Russia of murdering 400 civilians in Bucha before retreating from the town, the Russian government has refuted these allegations, pointing out that Russian forces withdrew in an orderly fashion on 30 March and that no allegations of extra judicial executions were made until 2 April 2022, four days later, when Ukrainian security forces and TV cameras arrived in Bucha. The US and NATO accepted Kiev\u2019s claims uncritically and used them to justify imposing further sanctions against Russia. However, serious doubts have arisen about a possible staged events and tampering with the photos and videos. After all, fake news has been in the global arena sawing intentionally spread misinformation propaganda news in recent decades since the war in Iraq.\n\nSo the serious question is: Do we have here another false flag operation as we have seen multiple times in Iraq Syria and Libya, staged chemical attacks that could not be confirmed by expert inspectors? Are the dead persons\u2019 civilians or military? Were the bodies of those of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian-civilian-victims of artillery bombardment? Were the bodies Russian soldiers wearing white armbands or Ukrainian civilians with white armbands to signal their peaceful intentions and subsequently lynched by Ukrainian extremists for collaboration with the Russians? One day we may find out whether the US had advance knowledge of the alleged crimes in Bucha or whether it was involved in manufacturing fake evidence for the information and psychological warfare. Of course, nobody knows. What we need is whistleblowers, more like Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. The classical mass media is no longer trustworthy; it has been long time since it proved to stage fake news even utilizing its social media wing.\n\nAn international commission of inquiry should investigate, but that will take time, because the evidence on the ground (to the extent it has not been destroyed) must be evaluated and witnesses on all sides must be heard. Gradually some information is coming out that does not confirm Ukrainian claims, and in a series of recorded satellite phone calls, a reporter identified as \u201cSimon\u201d tells his colleagues that at Borodyanka \u201cthere\u2019s no bodies in the streets at all\u201d, contrary to what he had been led to believe.\n\nApparently the town had been \u201cshelled to pieces\u201d, but it is not clear whether this was committed by Russian or Ukrainian artillery. In any event, Simon concluded \u201cthere is no evidence of any rights abuses here\u201d. Simon and his crew interviewed residents who reported that the Russian soldiers had been correct and given them food, water and other supplies. Simon concluded: \u201cI do not know what the prosecutor was talking about, but we have seen nothing like that. It is a completely different picture.\u201d An international investigation is justified and necessary, but any ad hoc commission must investigate allegations of crimes committed not only by Russian soldiers but also by Ukrainian soldiers and para-militaries, in particular against the Russian-Ukrainians of Lugansk and Donetsk since 2014, and the pogrom against 50 Russian-Ukrainians in Odessa in May 2014.\n\nTherefore, it could be said without fear of contradiction, that the GA vote was prematurely orchestrated hasty and coercive and cursive drama that left an added failure by this global entity. Sad enough, the GA violated the general principles of law concerning due process to be followed and the presumption of innocence. Above all, with due respect, the GA must have given the floor and the opportunity to entertain Russia\u2019s evidence and arguments and given due weight for conflict triggering matters with all fairness. The absence of due process is yet another disgrace for the General Assembly to gang up and take irrational, persuasive, hooligan type of nosy decision making forum without having any evidence put forward from either side to backstop its hasty resolution.\n\nThe UN-General Assembly\u2019s Double Standards\n\nThis is not the first and will not be the last time that the UN-General Assembly (GA) applies double standards and adopts flawed resolutions or decisions simply to please The USA, EU and the NATO alliance. It seems like the entire United Nations system has been hijacked by the West and has the full support of a homologated corporate media that acts as the echo chamber of the State Department.\n\nAnother example of shaky-double-standards and selective indignation: The International Criminal Court. We hear politicians demand a \u201cNuremberg\u201d Trial against Putin. Well, why not a Tribunal to investigate and condemn the crimes of aggression committed by Bill Clinton in Yugoslavia, by George W. Bush and Tony Blair in Iraq, by Barack Obama in Libya, Syria and Ukraine (after all, Obama was president when the \u201cno fly\u201d zone over Libya was manipulated for \u201cregime change\u201d. Worldwide, it has been recalled Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous words: \u201cWe came, we saw, he died\u201d.\n\nAny tribunal show should clearly investigate the crimes committed by Ukrainian sharp-shooters at Maidan in connection with the 2014 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the democratically elected President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovich. Was it not the legitimate legal duty or responsibility of the International Criminal Court also to investigate and prosecute the NATO forces from the US, UK, Germany, and Australia, who committed atrocities in Afghanistan and Iraq? How about the torture centers used in clandestine in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay? How about the use of indiscriminate weapons including depleted uranium weapons, white phosphorus and cluster bombs, causing tens of thousands of deaths? How about all the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d visited upon civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya?\n\nWhere is the accountability for all of these crimes? The International Criminal Court will not have any credibility until it decides to apply the Statute of Rome seriously and go after the likes of George W. Bush and Joe Biden. Hitherto the West has \u201cgotten away with it\u201d \u2013 but for how long? Will the ICC remain in the service of the West, as a strong arm of the Pentagon? Hitherto we have observed the culture of impunity that protects Western leaders. Will the rule of law ever evolve into the rule of justice? This is the real unanswered question that remains in limbo.\n\nInternational Court of Justice (ICC)\n\nEstablished in 2002 by the Rome Statute, the ICC has 123 member states where it can investigate and prosecute crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and state acts of aggression. (Ukraine has also not formally joined the court, but has submitted to its jurisdiction in the past.\n\nInternational court of Justice (ICC) affairs, after World War II, the prominent Nuremberg trials, led by the U.S. and allied powers, prosecuted Nazi war criminals. The U.S. has also backed international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone, which have held high-ranking individuals accountable for terrible crimes.\n\nBut the trouble to put the ICC into effective appliance of justice is when a state is too powerful to be bound by ICC\u2019s demands and decisions. The problem isn\u2019t about the absence of globally assured law but rather its breakdown, when states refuse to comply and aren\u2019t held accountable. This can further inflame conflicts unequal treatment of weaker nations in front of the ICC. The resulting pattern of war, displacement, and rampant human rights violations we\u2019re seeing in Ukraine has tragically become all too familiar due to the provocation of the 30 NATO pact members due to the Russophobes and their hooligan actions to squeeze and suffocate the Russian Republics and its citizens. So Russia had to protect itself before NATO takes over Ukraine against the treatment it signed in previous years.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not just Russia that seems not to pay attention to what the ICC rules and regulations are all about. Since the recent past, side-lining the ICC is true of the USA as well.\n\nFirstly, when President Bill Clinton signed the Rome Statute, he advised against U.S. ratification out of concern that the court could assert jurisdiction over U.S. officials and service members. Secondly, President George W. Bush then famously \u201cunsigned\u201d the Rome Statute less than one year before his illegal invasion of Iraq. Thirdly, when the Trump administration went so far as to sanction ICC prosecutors who were investigating possible U.S. crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nThe most powerful nations like U.S., China, Russia, India, etc., should have set exemplary relationships with the ICC \u2014 and the global rule of law more broadly. Yet on its part, the ICC is more tilted to the Western powers and active in helping the USA and NATO pact members in their intervention to upset weaker nations in their own rights than to sand firm equally to all its members with due respect and fairness.\n\nLooking at a resolution now in the USA Congress introduced by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) that calls for the U.S. to join the ICC, it is certain this will also be side lined as business as usual. That means, another resolution is required to repeal the 2002 law that prohibits the U.S. A\u2019s support for ICC investigations.\n\nIn principle, no country should stand in the way of accountability and remedy for global victims of conflict, whether in Ukraine, Palestine, Yemen, or elsewhere. This includes the United States, which must also reckon with its own crimes committed during the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine.\n\nUsually, Washington has been seeking supremacy by imposing ad hoc rules by masking itself under the mantle of human rights violation, humanitarian aids, and violation of international law. These are systematically devised excuses meant to advance both the US and NATO\u2019s joint militaristic interests at the cost of upsetting lives and livelihoods in Ukraine and elsewhere around the globe.\n\n\u201cWe cannot successfully cooperate with the rest of the world in establishing a reign of law,\u201d warned Robert H. Jackson, the chief U.S. prosecutor at Nuremberg, \u201cunless we are prepared to have that law sometimes operate against what would be our national advantage.\u201d\n\nFrom the outset, it was clear, Russia is among the nations who would not submit itself to Washington\u2019s will of global dominance. Instead, Russia, China and India are working hard to strengthen efforts aimed at the Non-allied nations\u2019 forum for power balance. In this regard, just like China, Russia is fighting to be part of an international community of equals and will not allow Western nations to ignore its legitimate security concerns which it attempted to clarify far ahead of the NATO proxy attempt to expand itself into Ukraine and further squeeze Russia outside of the global political and economic arena. In self-defense, Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine is meant to put an end to NATO\u2019s regional domination as well as the US-dominated world order.\n\nThe answer to the threat of nuclear weapons is not more nuclear weapons. The answer is a planet that engages in genuine disarmament with a goal of no nuclear weapons. The answer is to strengthen an international community of equals that will not easily consent Western nations to ignore their respective legitimate security concerns nationally and regionally.\n\nYet, Law alone won\u2019t deliver global justice. But if we want fewer wars, more diplomacy, and more international cooperation, then no country can remain above it.\n\n__\n\n\n\n\n\nTo publish article on borkena, please send a submission to info@borkena.com for consideration.\n\nJoin the conversation.

            "channel": "rferl.org",
            "text": "Former President Dmitry Medvedev's opinion article in the daily Kommersant in October 2021, ahead of Russia's massive military buildup along the Ukrainian border, was as surreal as it was acerbic.\n\nMedvedev, who owes his political career and his seemingly enormous wealth to Russian President Vladimir Putin, lashed out at Ukraine's leaders, calling them \"weak,\" \"nonindependent,\" and corrupt and adding there was no sense in negotiating with them.\n\nIn the article, which Western analysts described as \"chauvinistic,\" Medvedev described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, as beholden to \"the most rabid nationalist forces\" and accused him of \"completely chang[ing]\" his political and moral compass.\n\n\"One can only imagine how revolting it was for [Zelenskiy] to commit such a moral somersault,\" he said in the October 11 commentary.\n\nTo many Kremlin observers, Medvedev could have been talking about himself.\n\nThe 56-year-old former lawyer once represented the hopes of Russian liberals seeking democratic change. When Putin picked him to become president in 2008, many put doubts about the motives of the senior partner in the ruling \"tandem\" aside and latched onto the idea that reforms were in the offing.\n\nNearly 15 years later, a different Medvedev jumps out from the page. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 and has remained in the Kremlin ever since, steadily shutting the door on dissent and bringing the country into increasing confrontation with Kyiv and the West.\n\nAnd in recent months, as Putin narrowed his inner circle to a handful of hard-liners, launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, and taken the clampdown in Russia to new levels, Medvedev has done a flip -- at least verbally -- to stay in his patron's good graces.\n\nThe October commentary was one of several caustic articles, social-media posts, or remarks that Medvedev has issued in recent months, some of them echoing the outlandish kind of historical revisionism that Putin has used to vilify the West and underpin the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBellicose Name-Calling\n\nIn Russia's current bilious climate, with officials, lawmakers, and state TV guests seemingly vying to top one another in terms of belligerence, they may not seem outlandish. But they sharply contrast with Medvedev's established image as a mild-mannered, iPhone-toting technocrat.\n\n\"It's not so much the content. It's the tone -- the name calling. I don't remember Medvedev being like that earlier in his career,\" Brian Taylor, a professor of political science at Syracuse University who focuses on Russian politics, told RFE/RL. He said that Medvedev -- who lost a lot of power and influence when he was ousted as prime minister two years ago -- is trying to \"stay relevant\" politically.\n\nIn a March social-media post, Medvedev compared Polish, Slovak, and Czech leaders traveling by train to Kyiv to show support to Zelenskiy -- a transportation choice dictated by Russia's war in Ukraine -- to Vladimir Lenin's return trip to Russia from self-imposed exile in 1917, ahead of the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nMedvedev claimed that the Polish elite suffers from Russophobia due to anger over having lost control of the throne in Moscow 400 years ago -- an assertion that ignores far greater and more recent factors, such as the decades of repressive Soviet dominance over Poland and its neighbors.\n\nTimothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University who is an author and an expert on the region, called the post \"grotesque\" and said that Medvedev was trying to position himself as a populist speaking for ordinary citizens in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"But he is himself a caricature of the global elite, wealthy for no reason, trying to dictate to people in a foreign country what they should do and how they should think, endorsing a war of destruction in the name of nothing more, in the end, than his own personal comfort,\" Snyder wrote in a blog post.\n\nStanding By His Man, And His Money\n\nA 2017 investigation by now-imprisoned opposition leader Aleksei Navalny and his associates alleged that Medvedev used an array of charity and nonprofit organizations to collect $1.2 billion in donations from tycoons and state banks and then redirected the funds to purchase pricey assets, including luxury homes.\n\nMaria Snegovaya, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank, says the upsurge in Medvedev's belligerent public rhetoric is an attempt to demonstrate loyalty to Putin at a time of growing political infighting. \"Medvedev may want to signal to everyone that he is part of the system, that he is essentially by Putin's side,\" she told RFE/RL.\n\n\"I think he is desperate to at least secure some safety. His goal right now is to survive [within the system], not to climb his way back on the top of the vertical,\" she said, a reference to Medvedev's loss of influence since the end of presidency in 2012 and his loss of the prime minister's post in 2020.\n\nMedvedev once represented an influential faction in the constellation of competing groups that Putin uses to maintain power. But he has lost significant political weight over the years and some of his allies -- such as former Open Government Minister Mikhail Abyzov and the businessmen brothers Ziyavudin and Magomed Magomedov -- have ended up behind bars.\n\nMedvedev himself has fallen out of Putin's narrowing inner circle, now dominated by hawks with security-service backgrounds, in part due to the embarrassing allegations of corruption, analysts have said.\n\n'Fifth Column Of Traitors'\n\nAnd with the war in Ukraine clouding Russia's future, the atmosphere in the circles of power surrounding Putin may be tenser than ever.\n\nDenunciations and attacks on \"weak elements\" within the elite are on the rise \"and will become a big part of the dynamic,\" Snegovaya said, especially as the economy shrinks following the imposition of strict Western sanctions over the invasion.\n\nPutin has come out hard against any opposition to the war in Ukraine. In a chilling speech in mid-March, he asserted that there was a \"fifth column of national traitors\" inside the country and that Russians \"will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors.\"\n\nReports of senior Russian officials being put under house arrest have emerged in recent weeks following the initial failures in the war against Ukraine. Hard-line hawks within the elite may suspect Medvedev and his associates of not fully supporting the war, potentially making him an \"attractive\" target for attacks, Snegovaya said.\n\nArkady Dvorkovich, a former close adviser to Medvedev, was accused by a senior lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party of \"national betrayal\" last month after expressing concerns about the war and sympathy for civilians in Ukraine.\n\nDvorkovich soon stepped down as chairman of the Skolkovo Foundation, a technology hub located in Moscow region that emulates Silicon Valley and which Medvedev promoted on a trip to the United States during his presidency.\n\nRemember The 'Reset'?\n\nMedvedev, 56, has been one of Putin's most loyal allies over the past two decades. Putin tapped the former lawyer to succeed him as president in 2008 in order to avoid violating what was then a constitutional limit of two consecutive four-year terms.\n\nPutin's choice of Medvedev over fellow former KGB officer Sergei Ivanov \"signaled the possibility of a new, more liberal period in Russian politics, or so some hoped,\" Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow in 2012-14, wrote in his memoir, From Cold War To Hot Peace. Medvedev \"spoke a more sophisticated style of Russian than Putin, and seemed more orientated to, or at least familiar with, Western ideas,\" he wrote.\n\nMedvedev is not from the KGB and is a member of a generation of Russians who as a rule viewed the West and the collapse of the Soviet Union -- which came when he was in his 20s and Putin was almost 40 -- in a more positive light than their elders.\n\nIn a September 2009 article laying out his political vision, Medvedev described Russia's democracy as \"fragile\" and something that \"needs to be protected.\" He called for dialogue with civil society and touted changes he made to improve electoral competition. \"Putin had never said that,\" McFaul wrote.\n\nAs he was grooming his former campaign manager and fellow St. Petersburg native for the top job, Putin said that Medvedev could sometimes be tougher than him -- a remark that later seemed to presage Russia's invasion in Georgia in August 2008, three months after he took office.\n\nBut despite that move, Medvedev's presidency did seem to promise change, both at home and in ties with the West.\n\nHe pursued reforms at home and embraced President Barack Obama's \"reset\" of U.S.-Russia ties, signing the New START nuclear arms-reduction treaty with Obama in April 2010 and then smiling over cheeseburgers with him and enthusiastically taking in Silicon Valley during his U.S. visit that June.\n\nOn The Outside Looking In\n\nMedvedev's metamorphosis, if that is what it is, did not occur overnight. It slowly followed the sharp and steady souring of Russian-U.S. relations that can be traced to the end of 2011, when Putin accused the United States of fomenting protests over fraud-marred parliamentary elections and his decision -- announced by himself and Medvedev that September -- to return to the presidency in 2012.\n\nPutin swapped jobs with Medvedev, who remained in the No. 2 spot as prime minister until January 2020. Analysts said Putin replaced Medvedev as head of the government after he failed to deliver on the president's domestic priorities, including improving living standards.\n\nBut the shakeup also came as Putin was preparing constitutional amendments, adopted that July, that allow him to run for president again in 2024 and 2030, a move that seemed aimed to quash talk of a post-Putin Russia and ensure he could stay in power for years.\n\nPutin created a new role for Medvedev as deputy chairman of the Security Council, which is one of his main venues for decision-making on strategic issues but is a purely advisory body. Some analysts see the position as a sort of political retirement home for Medvedev. Putin is unlikely to \"put him in a position of trust anymore,\" Taylor said.\n\nMedvedev is among the top politicians least trusted by Russians, according to opinion polls, and Putin barred him from heading the United Russia party ticket for the September 2021 parliamentary elections.\n\nStarting around that time, Medvedev seems to have been seeking to step back into the spotlight with his acerbic, hawkish statements that are aligned with the rhetoric on state TV.\n\nThe new image as a brash Russian nationalist \"doesn't really fit him very well\" but may be part of a strategy to get back into a position of power at a later date, Taylor said.\n\n\"I think he -- maybe unrealistically -- still has political ambitions and doesn't know how the regime will shake out over the next few years, and he would rather be in power than out of power,\" he said. \"He may even still think that he could get the top job again.\"",

            "text": "Looking back at the past decade-and-a-half, we can see, with the benefit of hindsight, how the current aggression of Russia against Ukraine came to pass. It was enabled by the policies of the European neo-liberal elites.\n\nOn the day when Vladimir Putin decided to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he had no reason to fear any significant consequences from the West. For years, on many occasions and despite increasingly aggressive Russian behaviour he enjoyed gestures of support and friendship from the political leaders of countries such as Germany and France. It did not matter that he attacked Georgia, it did not matter when he annexed Crimea. It was still business as usual. So, why would he think that this time it would be any other way\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nGerhard Schr\u00f6der\n\nIn between the two long stretches of CDU rule (occasionally in coalition governments with the social democrats or the FDP liberals), there were several years during which Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (SPD \u2013 Social Democratic Party) was the chancellor. AndJust weeks before the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine he echoed Russia\u2019s rhetoric by saying on his podcast that Moscow had no interest in attacking Ukraine and felt alarmed by the accumulation of Nato troops in Eastern Europe.\u201cNato has not exactly been very restrained with exercises in the Baltic or Poland,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally, that has effects on Russia\u2019s thinking and threat assessment.\u201cI hope the sabre-rattling in Ukraine will be called off, because the things I\u2019m hearing from there, including finger-pointing at Germany because of its sensible refusal to export weapons \u2014 that really takes the biscuit.\u201dAlso in February 2022, he was nominated to join the board of directors at Gazprom.Talk about bad timing\u2026\n\nAngela Merkel\n\nAngela Merkel (CDU \u2013 Christian Democratic Union) has undoubtedly had a huge impact on the German and European political landscape, having served as the Chancellor of Germany for 16 years. The only person to serve longer than her was her fellow party member and mentor, Helmut Kohl, and he only served two weeks longer than her.Even though, a number of times, leaders of such countries as Poland and Ukraine warned her, that the project is intended to apply pressure on them by circumventing them as transit countries and denying them access to energy resources.And Merkel\u2019s cabinet would attempt to peddle a narrative according to which the pipelines would INCREASE the energy security of the region, since Germany would be able to resell Russian gas to them.But all this should not come as a surprise to anyone.At a 2007 meeting with Putin in Sochi, during her first term as Chancellor, she said \u201cthat Russia, when it was still the Soviet Union, was a very reliable supplier of energy resources for decades, and we would like this to continue.\u201dPerhaps Ms Merkel thought that by making Russia reliant on German money paid for natural gas, it is somehow possible to control Russia or at least prevent it from leading an imperialist policy. But this conviction soon fired back. Russia invaded Georgia the next year, and now, 15 years later,The Kremlin realises this very well, and possibly realised it back in 2007.To be fair to her, Angela Merkel did say in March 2014 that \u201cGermany will never accept the annexation of Crimea\u201d. But the lack of acceptance for the illegal annexation of the southern Ukrainian peninsula did not translate from words to deeds. Germany continued to make business deals with Russia. The decision to construct Nord Stream 2 was made just one year after the \u201cunacceptable\u201d annexation of Crimea.It seems that nothing Russia would do could serve as a wake-up call for Ms Merkel. Speaking in 2015, while she did concede that \u201cRussia has not made further progress in the past few years toward adopting many of the ideas that we share in the G7,\u201d she still hoped that Russia can be worked with to help provide for global security in what she termed \u201cNATO-Russia partnership\u201d.\u201cWe have the Normandy format for resolving the Ukraine crisis,\u201d she said. The Normandy format has clearly failed. She also said that \u201cRussia will and must also be included in efforts to resolve the Syrian civil war.\u201d Russia was backing the authoritarian regime of Bashar al-Assad in the conflict, yet Merkel stressed that \u201cit was only with the help of Russia that chemical weapons were removed from Syria,\u201d and so \u201cwe will also be discussing how Russia can be included.\u201d\n\nOlaf Scholz\n\nRestart, reset, engagement, dialogue, negotiations\u2026 They all come down to appeasement of a Putin dictatorship that has only become more hostile. Concessions to thugs and terrorists just encourage more aggression, as always. https://t.co/jFmtlZ0ozR \u2014 Garry Kasparov (@Kasparov63) January 3, 2022\n\nFor thirty years, Germans lectured Ukrainians about fascism. When fascism actually arrived, Germans funded it, and Ukrainians died fighting it. \u2014 Timothy Snyder (@TimothyDSnyder) April 20, 2022\n\nThe current Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz (SPD) has found himself in quite a conundrum. The Russian invasion of Ukraine began less than three months into his chancellorship. But he can hardly criticise Merkel\u2019s cabinet on its policy towards Russia.The current government is formed by a \u201cTraffic Lights Coalition\u201d (red for SPD, yellow for the liberal FDP, and green for\u2026 The Greens). And Olaf Scholz\u2019s Foreign Minister in the cabinet became the then co-leader of The Greens (in Germany, The Greens always make a point of electing two leaders, a woman and a man) Annalena Baerbock.Truly, keeping his own ministers in check must have been quite a toil for Mr Scholz, especially in a situation when interests of parties which may see eye-to-eye on some issues, but have radically different agenda\u2019s on others.In January, FM Baerbock also travelled to meet with her US counterpart, Antony Blinken, and the discussion about the threat posed by Russia was one of the topics of the talks., who Tweeted:Merely a week and a half before the war broke out, Chancellor Scholz still had hopes that the conflict could be avoided. \u201cThe diplomatic possibilities are far from being exhausted,\u201d Scholz said back then. He also praised the apparent withdrawal of the Russian troops from the border with Ukraine, following yet another unannounced \u201cmilitary manoeuvres.\u201dNow that the war has started, the Chancellor and his top diplomat are of one mind at least on one thing, and that is that Germany should not supply Ukraine with weapons, ostensibly because of Germany\u2019s troubled history with war.But when it comes to that, the outcome of such attitude has probably been best summarised by Timothy Snyder, an American historian specialising in the history of Central and Eastern Europe and especially the toll that totalitarian regimes took on the people of the region, who described the outcome of such policy in such blunt terms:Mr Snyder has written numerous books about the bloodied history of the countries wedged between Germany and Russia. He can most definitely write another historical opus about the events unfolding before our eyes, but for now, that Tweet offers a pretty decent summary of what German foreign policies in Central and Eastern Europe have brought about.A few weeks ago, the German government was ridiculed for offering to send Ukraine 5,000 helmets. The Germans stepped up their game a bit and offered to provide Ukraine with assistance in the form of other equipment. But when Ukrainians presented them with a list of the necessary material, the Germans struck out any requested heavy military equipment from it, such as e.g. Leopard tanks.\n\nWhat Chancellor Scholz offered instead, was that Germany will send to Ukraine its Soviet-era equipment, that the Federal Republic of Germany inherited from the People\u2019s Army of the communist German Democratic Republic (East Germany) upon German re-unification.\n\n\n\nThe excuses for that were several, one of them being that it would diminish Germany\u2019s own defensive capabilities. And that in spite of the fact that the German military industry is perfectly well capable of manufacturing enough equipment to provide for the defensive needs of Germany and more.\n\n\n\nMany countries of the former Eastern Bloc have offered to send Ukraine their Warsaw-Pact-era equipment. The difference here is that in the case of countries such as Czechia or Poland, this equipment has been conserved to be serviceable until very recently, while their militaries were updating their weaponry to the modern western-manufactured arsenal. Whether post-Soviet equipment that would be sent by Germany is at all serviceable after spending over 30 years rotting away in warehouses is dubious at best.\n\nDonald Tusk elected head of EPP The President of the European Council and former Polish PM Donald Tusk has been elected unopposed as leader of the European People\u2019s Party (EPP) at... see more\n\nDonald Tusk\n\nThe two existing strings of the Yamal gas pipeline. Photo: Wikimedia Commons/Samuel Bailey\n\nThe former Prime Minister of Poland and once-President of the European Council said in a recent interview given to the Polish weekly \u201cPolityka\u201d, that in Brussels, he had an opinion of a Russophobe, almost monomaniacally pre-occupied with Ukraine. But for those who have an attention span longer than the four-year electoral cycle, it is not exactly the way they may remember his behaviour or his policies towards Russia prior to the annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbas in 2014 (Mr Tusk was elected the President of the EC later that year).Mr Tusk became the Prime Minister of Poland after the snap election in 2007. But Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, who ran on the Law and Justice party ticket, remained the President of Poland. This led to a conflict between the offices of the PM, now Mr Tusk, and President Kaczy\u0144ski.Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, as well as his twin brother Jaros\u0142aw (who has served and continues to serve as the head of the Law and Justice party), have always remained wary of Russian imperial ambitions, seeking closer ties with the US as the largest NATO country and the best guarantor of Poland\u2019s security. There were even plans to construct elements of a US-backed anti-missile shield in Poland to increase its defensive capabilities.These plans were cancelled following the 2007 elections to avoid tensions with Russia.According to him, \u201cthe lack of dialogue serves neither Poland nor Russia. It is bad for the interests of both countries on the international arena,\u201d adding that \u201cthe time for a change in the matter [of Polish-Russian relations] is now,\u201d and that, according to him \u201csignals from our eastern neighbour confirm that they are also maturing to reach that conclusion.\u201dThroughout most of his tenure as PM, the Tusk cabinet attempted to distance itself from the US and tie Poland closer to Brussels, including by maintaining good relations with Berlin. Berlin and the Merkel government have, as previously demonstrated, done their best to maintain good relations with Russia at any cost, and the then Polish government attempted to do the same.When in 2008 Russian forces invaded the Caucasian country of Georgia, ostensibly to protect the people of the autonomous region of South Ossetia (which after Russian victory in the war was transformed into an internationally unrecognised breakaway republic under Russian protectorate \u2013 some of our observant readers may notice a pattern there\u2026), President Kaczy\u0144ski, along with the heads of state of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia visited the beleaguered Georgia and during a rally in the country\u2019s capital of Tbilisi addressed the crowds with words that now seem prophetic:The fact that the President was conducting his own foreign policy, independent of the Prime Minister, was not well received. PM Tusk and his cabinet have been trying to pursue a policy of rapprochement with the Kremlin, and President Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s visit did not help in achieving that goal., during what was to be a visit to the Katyn Memorial, where thousands of Polish officers murdered by the Soviet NKVD are buried. There were no survivors.The catastrophe immediately sparked accusations from Law and Justice politicians and supporters against the Kremlin, accusing Putin of orchestrating an assassination of the Polish President and his entourage. Several factors were of particular concern, e.g. aeroplane was of Soviet manufacture and as such, it was serviced in Russia. To exacerbate the matter the Polish government led by Donald Tusk relinquished the investigation to the Russian side, even though it could pursue an international investigation into the crash, which sparked accusations of at best gross negligence, and at worst collusion. The Russians refused to release the wreck of the aeroplane, leaving it to be exposed to the elements and eaten away by rust on the Smolensk airfield.But in Poland, the matter of who is responsible for the death of the President and the rest of the Polish delegation only fueled the polarisation of the political scene., and even mocked those who entertained the idea.Nine years after it was proposed, and six years after the construction beganMoreover, there were plans to sign a long-term contract for the supply of Russian natural gas via the Yamal pipeline until 2037, and securing Russian transit rights through Poland for supplying Europe with natural gas until 2045.\n\nSince the pipeline splits into two branches in Belarus, whose dictator, Alyaksandr Lukashenka is Putin\u2019s vassal, and one of the branches circumvents the territory of Poland, and the other the territory of Ukraine, each of the countries could at any time see its natural gas supply cut off entirely. The construction of Nord Stream and the abandonment of plans to diversify the Polish gas supply would put Poland and Ukraine entirely at Putin\u2019s mercy.\n\n\n\nIf Mr Tusk did indeed have an opinion of a Russophobe among other European politicians in Brussels, then it really tells us more about the state of mind of those politicians. If Poland\u2019s Deputy PM Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, who continues to maintain that Putin had his brother murdered, or Mr Donald Tusk, who completely dismissed the idea, are both Russophobes, then perhaps \u201cRussophobe\u201d is simply another word Brussels politicians use for \u201ca person from a country which had the misfortune to border Russia for centuries\u201d.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt\n\nGuy Verhofstadt is a liberal Flemish-Belgian politician, former Belgian MP, minister and Prime Minister, and currently an MEP and the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe faction in the European Parliament, in which position he has served since 2009.He is a strong advocate of a tighter European integration in the form of transforming the European Union into a federal entity, \u201cThe United States of Europe\u201d, which is also the title of a book he published in 2005.Back in 2002, following the shock of the 9/11 attacks, Mr Verhofstadt, who was then the Belgian PM, went even further. During a meeting of the Russia-NATO Council, which was meant to bring the alliance and Russia closer in terms of co-operating on global security, he said that:Any gains in those terms that Russia had made since the fall of communism have obviously been erased during the past 20 years of Putin\u2019s rule, and when it comes to global security, Russia has served as a destabilising factor. Not only when it invaded Georgia and now Ukraine, but also through its involvement in Mali and elsewhere.Mr Verhofstadt is one of those European politicians who have visited Ukraine in recent weeks and was abhorred by the evidence of atrocities perpetrated in places such as Borodyanka by the Russian invasion troops. To his credit, for the last several years he has been highly critical of European politicians who maintain a relationship with Russian politicians connected to the Kremlin. Justly so.The problem is that Mr Verhofstadt is linking anyone who disagrees with his liberal agenda, that is anyone who can be considered even remotely conservative, to Putin. For him, every conservative is just as bad as a dictator of a country that exercises practically full control of the media, imprisons or even murders political opponents, orders the invasion of neighbouring countries, and has his soldiers perpetrate genocide and other war crimes. Such a skewed perspective is not much different from accusing anyone with slightly different political views of being a re-incarnation of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, etc.And while it is true that several leaders of European conservative or right-wing movements have indeed fallen for the Kremlin peddled narrative portraying Putin\u2019s regime as one standing up to the \u201crotten, liberal West\u201d, even the current savage aggression perpetrated by Russia against Ukraine not quite making them rethink their attitude, some accusations are more hit-and-miss.\n\nFor example, Guy Verhofstadt has been an extremely vocal critic of the current Polish government. He was very critical of the \u201cWarsaw Summit\u201d, a conference of conservative and right- and centre-right-wing party leaders that occurred in Warsaw in December 2021, that was organised by the Polish ruling United Right coalition.\n\n\n\nIn a Tweet written in Polish, he referred to a very controversial comment made by Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French right-wing National Rally party. Her comment dated extremely poorly over the past several months, that is quite clear. But when Mr. Verhofstadt writes that \u201cOnly Putin and zero Europe\u2026 Law and Justice brings Poland closer to their national nightmare\u2026 in the name of blind party ambitions!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTylko Putin i zero Europy\u2026\n\n\n\nPiS przybli\u017ca Polsk\u0119 coraz bardziej do ich narodowego koszmaru\u2026 wszystko w imi\u0119 \u015blepych ambicji partyjnych ! https://t.co/h3JOAUKDnj \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) December 6, 2021\n\nWell\u2026 Ms Le Pen\u2019s comments, as already said, dated extremely poorly. The Hungarian PM, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, was also present at the summit, and his reluctance to give up cheap Russian crude oil and natural gas in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has met with harsh criticism from the Polish government, making the regional co-operation within the V4 group (made up of Poland, Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia) extremely hard.\n\n\n\nBut accusing the Polish conservatives of being Putin\u2019s supporters? People that believe that the Kremlin is responsible for the death of a Polish president from their own party?\n\n\n\nIt seems that according to Mr Verhofstadt\u2019s logic, the Polish government is some strange animal, in the vein of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat. It somehow manages to be anti-Russian and pro-Putin at the same time.\n\n\n\nAnd of course, any chance to lambast conservatives is a good one... So Guy Verhofstadt throws muck at conservative and right-wing politicians, and hopes something will stick. But he should be more careful when using photos of European politicians being chummy with Putin, because there are many European politicians that over the years have shaken Putin\u2019s hand. Including Mr Verhofstadt himself.\n\nWhen Europe is under threat, always remember:\n\n\n\nThose who talk about our sovereignty are always the first the sell it off ! pic.twitter.com/YqWxcPxqqH \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) February 22, 2022\n\nEmmanuel Macron\n\nCompared to other old hands listed so far, the President of the French Republic is relatively new to politics. His career only really began when he worked for one of the agencies of the Ministry of Finance in 2004 and served as an adviser to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande since 2006. But the only post he was ever elected to was that of the president, in 2017.Mr Macron\u2019s relationship with Putin is a complicated one. To his credit,He has also ordered airstrikes against Russian-backed Syrian government forces.His opinion on the subject may have evolved since then.he said in November 2019 in an interview given to The Independent. NATO Secretary-General and even Mr Macron\u2019s close ally, Chancellor Merkel, were shocked by the assessment, the latter even calling Macron\u2019s statement \u201cdrastic words\u201d. This was in contrast to the reaction of the Kremlin. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson called them \u201ctruthful words\u201d.And perhaps most controversially, he defended the selling of French-manufactured weapons to Russia, which occurred between 2014 and 2020, so after the illegal annexation of Crimea. While it is true that the decision was originally made by the Hollande administration, President Macron did not immediately put a stop to the arms trade.It seems that the ability to freely trade with Russia is very important to the French leader.The fact that many countries are not comfortable with Russia due to its aggressive policies appears to have eluded him. The fact that France, positioned on the other side of Europe and far away from Russia, may have been a contributing factor.Back in the day he said that the sanctions were inefficient, and that they \u201chave changed absolutely nothing in Russia \u2014 I am not proposing at all to lift them, I am just stating this.\u201d Well, that much has definitely proven true. The question is whether the correct course of action would not have been applying more sanctions, something that European countries were in the end forced to do, but it is happening only now, after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Macron has made numerous phone calls to Putin following the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian hostilities to a full-scale invasion. His frequent contacts with Putin and attempts at diplomacy have even invited mockery. Macron\u2019s attempts to broker peace have also been criticised by some politicians, including the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki who, when commenting on the French President for his efforts, asked whether he would also negotiate with Hitler. This prompted the French head of state to lash out against the Polish PM, not only accusing him of trying to interfere in French elections on behalf of Marine Le Pen, but also of being an antisemite and homophobe.\n\n\n\nAccording to President Macron, following the revelation of war crimes perpetrated on Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and its vicinity, he is no longer in direct contact with Vladimir Putin. He has also joined the calls for an embargo on Russian crude oil, although, notably, not on natural gas. But just as the call for an embargo on one strategic energy resource the sale of which is filling the Kremlin\u2019s coffers is blunted by the refusal to give up another one, he has been rather coy when it comes to calling a spade a spade.\n\n\u201cSo far, it has been established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and bring them to justice,\u201d Macron said during an interview given to France 2 television channel on April 13. As he said \u201cI am very careful with some terms [genocide] these days,\u201d he added. \u201cI'm not sure the escalation of words is helping the cause right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nFortunately for Mr Macron, who is running for re-election (the second round of the French presidential election will take place on April 24), his reluctance to call the genocide Russians are perpetrating against Ukrainians a genocide is still probably not as jarring as Ms Le Pen\u2019s statements about Crimea belonging within the Russian sphere of influence.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy\n\nsource: TVP World\n\nAnd finally, on a brief note, the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Sarkozy was one of the western leaders who helped negotiate a cease-fire during the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008 (officially: \u201cpeace enforcement\u201d). The Kremlin agreed to halt its invasion of its southern neighbour, once they have achieved their military goals, that is the conquest of South Ossetia. So perhaps giving Sarkozy too much credit for his role in the cessation of hostilities would be a bit of a stretch.But the issue is not Mr Sarkozy\u2019s role in brokering a cease-fire, but rather what followed.In a speech on April 3, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited Mr Sarkozy (as well as Angela Merkel) to visit Bucha, the site of the Russian-perpetrated massacre. He said that while he does not blame anyone except Russia for the aggression on Ukraine, he insisted the two former leaders \u201csee tortured Ukrainians with their own eyes\u201d, so that they can understand what the concession policy to Russia has led to 14 years later.",

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The Russians hadn\u2019t taken into account the railway saboteurs of Belarus. Starting in the earliest days of the invasion in February, a clandestine network of railway workers, hackers and dissident security forces went into action to disable or disrupt the railway links connecting Russia to Ukraine through Belarus, wreaking havoc on Russian supply lines.\n\nThe attacks have drawn little attention outside Belarus amid the drama of the Russian onslaught and the bloody aftermath of Russia\u2019s humiliating retreat. Fierce Ukrainian resistance and tactical errors by an ill-prepared Russian force were likely enough to thwart Russia\u2019s plans, analysts say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Belarus railway saboteurs can at least claim a role in fueling the logistical chaos that quickly engulfed the Russians, leaving troops stranded on the front lines without food, fuel and ammunition within days of the invasion.\n\nAlexander Kamyshin, head of Ukrainian railways, expressed Ukraine\u2019s gratitude to the Belarusian saboteurs. \u201cThey are brave and honest people who have helped us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe attacks were simple but effective, targeting the signal control cabinets essential to the functioning of the railways, members of the activist network said. For days on end, the movement of trains was paralyzed, forcing the Russians to attempt to resupply their troops by road and contributing to the snarl-up that stalled the infamous 40-mile military convoy north of Kyiv.\n\nHow much of the chaos can be attributed to the sabotage and how much to poor logistical planning by the Russians is hard to tell, especially as there is no independent media reporting from Belarus, said Emily Ferris, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. But without automated signaling, trains were forced to slow to a crawl and the number of them traveling on the tracks at any one time would have been severely restricted, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGiven the Russian reliance on trains, I\u2019m sure it contributed to some of the problems they had in the north. It would have slowed down their ability to move,\u201d she said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t push further into Ukrainian territory and snarled their supply lines because they had to rely on trucks.\u201d\n\nThe attacks also bought time for Ukrainian troops to formulate an effective response to the Russian invasion, said Yury Ravavoi, a Belarusian activist and trade unionist who escaped to Poland under threat of arrest during the anti-government protests that rocked Belarus in 2020.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say we were the most important factor, but we were an important brick in the wall,\u201d he said.\n\nThe saboteurs drew inspiration from an earlier episode in Belarusian history, during World War II, when Belarusians opposed to the Nazi occupation blew up railway lines and train stations to disrupt German supply lines. The Rail War, as it is known, is venerated as a moment of triumph for Belarus, taught in schools as the most successful of the tactics deployed by resistance fighters that eased the way for Soviet troops to drive the Germans out.\n\nThe battle for control over eastern and southern Ukrainian cities is the latest stage in this war, as Russia attempts to solidify its grip on the Black Sea. (Video: Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)\n\nEight decades later, it is Russia\u2019s presence in Belarus that has stirred dissent. The deployment of tens of thousands of Russian troops in Belarus in preparation for the invasion of Ukraine triggered widespread domestic opposition and rekindled opposition networks formed during the 2020 protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said Hanna Liubakova, a Belarusian journalist living in exile in Lithuania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis second Rail War has taken a more benign form than its predecessor. The partisans were keen not to inflict casualties, Ravavoi said. So they focused their attacks on damaging equipment to stop the railways from functioning.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to kill any Russian army or Belarusian train drivers. We used a peaceful way to stop them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe and other Belarusians involved in organizing the attacks decline to reveal precise details of how the attacks were carried out and by whom, citing the need for secrecy and concerns for the safety of the railway partisans, as the saboteurs are loosely known.\n\nThree main groups have been involved, representing railway workers, security force defectors and cyber specialists, said Lt. Col Alexander Azarov, a former security official living in Warsaw who heads the security force group called Bypol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRailway employees sympathetic to the partisans have leaked details of Russian movements and the locations of key railway infrastructure to a group called the Community of Railway Workers, which shares them on Telegram channels. Supporters on the ground link up to carry out the attacks, but there is no formal chain of command, Azarov said.\n\n\u201cOur movement is not centralized,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a leader of the resistance. It\u2019s horizontal, with dozens of groups working on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe third group, the Cyber Partisans, is formed of exiled Belarusian IT professionals who have carried out several cyberattacks on the Belarusian government since joining in 2020.\n\nThe Cyber Partisans launched the first attack, hacking into the railway\u2019s computer network in the days leading up to the invasion and snarling rail traffic before Russian troops had even crossed the border. Infiltrating the railway network\u2019s computers was relatively easy, said Yuliana Shemetovets, a spokesperson for the group who is based in New York, because the railway company is still using Windows XP, an outdated version of the software that contains many vulnerabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting on Feb. 26, two days after the invasion began, a succession of five sabotage attacks against signaling cabinets brought train traffic to an almost complete halt, said Sergey Voitekhovich, a former railway employee now based in Poland who is a leader in the Community of Railway Workers.\n\nBy Feb. 28, satellite photographs began to appear of the 40-mile convoy of Russian trucks and tanks ostensibly headed from Belarus toward Kyiv. Within a week, the convoy had completely stalled as vehicles ran out of fuel or broke down.\n\nThe Belarusian authorities have since launched an intense effort to prevent attacks and hunt down the saboteurs. The Interior Ministry has decreed that damaging railway infrastructure is an act of terrorism, a crime that carries a 20-year prison term.\n\nDozens of railway workers have been randomly detained and their phones searched for evidence that they were in touch with the partisans, the activists say. At least 11 Belarusians are in custody, accused of participating in the attacks, according to human rights groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early April, security police captured three alleged saboteurs near the town of Bobruisk and shot them in the knees. State television broadcast footage of the bleeding men, their knees bandaged, and claimed they had been shot while resisting arrest.\n\nThe shootings have had a chilling effect on the saboteur network, Azarov said. Belarusian troops are patrolling and drones have been deployed to monitor the railway lines. \u201cIt has become too dangerous to do attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nBut by the time of the police shooting, Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the area around Kyiv was in full swing and the Kremlin had announced it would refocus its military effort on capturing the east of Ukraine. The majority of the Russian troops that entered Ukraine from Belarus are now in the process of being redeployed to the east, the Pentagon says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe believe the fact that the Russians gave up on taking Kyiv is a result of our work because the Russians didn\u2019t feel as safe in Belarus as they had expected,\u201d said Franak Viacorka, spokesman for Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. \u201cThousands of Russian troops didn\u2019t receive food, they didn\u2019t receive fuel, and they didn\u2019t receive equipment on time.\u201d\n\nNow, a new phase in the rail war may be underway. In recent days the railway activists have posted on Telegram photographs of damage to signaling cabinets along Russian railway lines being used to transport troops into eastern Ukraine. The attacks can\u2019t be independently confirmed, but Voitekhovich claimed members of his railway network are involved. \u201cThere are open borders between Belarus and Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "4/24/2022\n\ntags: foreign policy\n\nDaniel Herman is Professor of American History at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington. He is the author of three monographs including Hell on the Range: A Story of Honor, Conscience, and the American West (2010) and the novel The Feudist (2020).\n\nUS Senator John McCain speaks to a pro-EU crowd in Kyiv, December 2013.\n\nThis past March, three esteemed colleagues at Central Washington University convened a teach-in to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine (they convened another one in April, which I didn\u2019t attend and so won\u2019t talk about). The presenters\u2014all experts in the fields of Russian history and culture\u2014gave bravura expositions exploring Russian nationalism, empire building, war, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. To my mind, however, something was missing: dissent.\n\nThough effective in its aims\u2014to teach history and generate support (including money) for Ukraine\u2014this particular teach-in differed profoundly from civil disobedience campaigns of the Vietnam era. Those who participated in the original anti-war teach-ins of the 1960s stood the risk of being ridiculed, bombed, spied on by FBI agents, and excoriated by community authorities and administrators. The CWU presenters, by contrast, buttressed rather than challenged a dominant narrative, given that 70% of Americans already view Russia as a threat. If the presenters are critical of hawkish U.S. foreign policy and the decades-long expansion of the military-industrial complex, not to mention the role of the U.S. in heightening tensions in Ukraine, they didn\u2019t say so.\n\nI find this particularly troubling at a time when 45% of Americans\u2014and 81% of Republicans\u2014view President Biden\u2019s actions viz. Ukraine as too cautious; 46% support a U.S.-imposed no-fly zone even when told it would risk nuclear war; and Congressional Democrats (Democrats!) seek to add billions more to the already record military budget that the administration requests.\n\nI\u2019m no expert on the history of Russia or Ukraine, but I am an avid consumer of news and I know quite a bit about U.S. history, including the history of U.S. wars and public opinion. In the spirit of scholarly debate\u2014and with respect and admiration for the presenters\u2014I take it upon myself to offer a dissenting view.\n\nHad I been among the presenters, I would have asserted that the overwhelming American support for Ukrainians in their fight against Russia\u2014though not without justice\u2014resembles earlier moments of American solidarity with European nations fighting authoritarianism, particularly 1917, when the U.S., reacting to German attacks and atrocities (but ignorant of British atrocities) joined the Entente Powers in what President Wilson called \u201ca war for democracy.\u201d Though the U.S. helped defeat autocratic Germany, the war spawned persecutions, authoritarianism, and jingoism at home (not least among Democrats, particularly intellectuals) and\u2014due to the terms of the Versailles Treaty\u2014fueled the rise of Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn that 1917 moment, like this one, a bellicose press\u2014with assistance from a bellicose government\u2014shut down dissent and marginalized dissenters. Randolph Bourne\u2019s justly famous essay condemning war fever seems every bit as apropos as it was in 1917.\n\nI do not doubt that Putin (rather like Germany\u2019s Kaiser) is a would-be imperialist who holds nostalgia for the Soviet Union and/or \u201cGreater Russia,\u201d and would like to recreate one or both, albeit without communism. The probability of that happening, however, seems exceedingly low. Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin had said that those who wish to recreate the Soviet Union \u201chave no brain\u201d and that his conventional military can in no way match that of NATO. More to the point, recreating the Soviet Union or Greater Russia would be enormously expensive and almost certainly impossible, no matter the outcome in Ukraine (part of why the Soviet Union dissolved was because the empire was more encumbrance than asset).\n\nMy own take is that the Western media\u2019s anti-Putin, pro-Ukraine, pro-NATO barrage has blinded both Americans and Europeans (especially the British, those hoary players of the \u201cGreat Game\u201d) to the fact that Putin, though capable of great brutality, is a rational actor. He is as likely to consolidate power due to the West\u2019s fervent response as to lose it. By making a diplomatic solution almost impossible (politicians need public support for any offer to lift sanctions as part of a peace package), the West\u2019s fervency might well protract the killing for years and destabilize Eastern Europe.\n\nLet me start my more detailed discussion by talking about NATO expansion. One of the teach-in presenters acknowledged that the U.S. and its European allies may have made a mistake by expanding NATO into nations that comprised the old Soviet Union but added that \u201cwoulda/couldas\u201d of past policymaking are beside the point. I disagree passionately. Revisiting \u201cwoulda/couldas\u201d is probably the only thing that can bring peace, at least any time in the near future.\n\nI have no particular expertise in foreign policy, but I defer to those who do (or did before their decease): George Kennan, the doyen of American Cold War policy; Paul Nitze, Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan; Paul Warnke, director of the Arms Control Association and SALT II negotiator; Richard Pipes, noted historian of the Soviet Union; Gary Hart, former Colorado Senator and co\u2011chair of the U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century; Jack Matlock, President Reagan\u2019s ambassador to the Soviet Union; Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State under Richard Nixon; William Perry, Secretary of Defense to Bill Clinton; and Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense under George Bush and Barack Obama. All of them\u2014and many others\u2014feared that NATO expansion into the former Soviet Union would lead to a renewed Cold War, if not a hot one.\n\nKennan\u2019s words are particularly apropos. The NATO expanders, he argued, had \u201clittle understanding of Russian history and Soviet history. Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then [the NATO expanders] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cI think it is the beginning of a new cold war \u2026 I think it is a tragic mistake.\u201d\n\nIn their zeal to punch Vladimir Putin, modern Democrats and their preferred media voices are quick to dismiss or diminish the assertion that the U.S. played a significant role in provoking the war (this isn\u2019t the Democratic Party of the 1970s or even the early 2000s; it\u2019s a party dedicated, or at least inured, to regime change policies, not just for Russia, but also Syria, Libya, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, Bolivia, and others to be announced). But yes, alas, the U.S. and NATO did much to provoke the war, and not just by expanding NATO. The U.S. also provoked the war with its own election meddling in Eastern Europe, especially in Ukraine, a meddling that was magnitudes\u2014light years\u2014greater than whatever Russia did or did not do in our 2016 election.\n\nSomething I have not seen reported in any mainstream venue is that as late as 2008, fully 50% of Ukrainians opposed NATO membership versus 24.3% who supported it. Another 2008 poll showed even greater opposition (56% against joining NATO versus 15% for). In a 2010 Gallup poll, 40% of Ukrainians viewed NATO as more threat than protector (just 17% said the opposite). What those poll numbers suggest is that the current situation resulted not from timeless Ukrainian fears of Russian aggression, but from blundering, arrogant neo-conservative Western foreign policy, along with equally blundering and over-aggressive Russian and Ukrainian policies since 2008.\n\nPolicy blunders, to be sure, weren\u2019t the only mover of opinion. Both the U.S. and EU offered powerful economic incentives. Quite simply, the EU and US are vastly wealthier than Russia and can offer enormous loans, bailouts, and investment capital. The fact that Russia has been Ukraine\u2019s main export partner, however, equalizes the equation to a degree.\n\nIf free market economics alone are driving Ukraine\u2019s movement toward the West, Russia should stand out of the way. The West, however, has not let the invisible hand do all the work. It also deploys another, more visible\u2014more problematic\u2014hand: the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), an agency created under President Reagan to perform tasks once under the purview of the CIA, including \u201cfostering \u2026 political parties, trade unions, free markets and business organizations.\u201d As idealistic and non-controversial as those goals sound, NED has a long history of promoting regime change; one observer calls it the National Endowment (for Meddling) in Democracy. In Ukraine, NED has poured tens of millions of dollars into building a pro-Western constituency. NED\u2019s European cousin, the European Endowment for the Democracy, has done the same on a smaller scale. They are assisted by the West\u2019s lavishly funded NGO complex, which (like NED) extended its reach across Eastern Europe. Total U.S. investment in Ukrainian \u201cgood governance\u201d and \u201cother goals,\u201d averred former Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland (now Undersecretary of State), amounted to $5 billion between 1991 and 2013.\n\nLet\u2019s step back a moment and imagine that Russia was an economic juggernaut able to spend $5 billion to turn Mexico into a close ally, modernize its army. Imagine, moreover, that Russia proposed to station troops\u2014along with anti-ballistic missiles\u2014in Mexico after bringing it into a defensive alliance (which is what NATO has done in nations formerly allied with Russia). Imagine, moreover, that Mexico was receptive to Russia\u2019s money\u2014and welcomed its meddling\u2014because it was poor and because some of its citizens, but not a majority, had lingering fears of U.S. hostility. Keep in mind that the U.S. has invaded Mexico twice, though not recently. That is precisely what the United States and its NATO allies have done in Ukraine.\n\nOne can certainly reply that Western meddling is necessary to counter Russian meddling. Russia clearly supports Ukrainian parties and leaders that favor its interests. No doubt it has brought tremendous pressure to bear on Ukrainian governments. I reiterate, however, that, as late as 2010, Ukrainians didn\u2019t want to join NATO. It was the West that had to lobby Ukrainians to gain support.\n\nThe NED/NGO complex is obviously not the only reason that Ukrainians have increasingly favored entering NATO and the EU. There is also the matter of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for the breakaway states in the Donbas (including sending a small number of troops), which occurred in reaction to Ukraine\u2019s Maidan revolution in 2014. The effect of Russia\u2019s decision was to strengthen Ukrainian nationalism and support for NATO, partly due to Russia\u2019s straightforward aggression, and partly because the withdrawal of Crimea and the Donbas greatly diminished Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian electorate.[1]\n\nGiven that Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea and Donbas created a predictable Ukrainian backlash, why did Russia take them? What we mostly hear from the cable press\u2014whether Fox, MSNBC, or CNN\u2014is that Putin\u2019s Russia is an imperialist, hateful, lying nation guided by the idea that might makes right. The Maidan revolution and its aftermath, however, is complex and ambiguous.\n\nTo understand that revolution\u2014or coup, by some accounts\u2014we have to go back to 2008, when George W. Bush, along with NATO, declared that Ukraine and Georgia would both become NATO members. Russia\u2014which had been warning against NATO expansion even before the first wave in 1999\u2014threatened war if that happened. From the Russian point of view, NATO wasn\u2019t an innocent, defensive alliance, but an aggressive, pro-Western alliance seeking to encircle them, isolate them economically, and, ultimately, strangle them militarily. In his speech justifying the Ukraine invasion, Putin discussed the threat of NATO encirclement in his first substantive paragraph and mentioned NATO nine more times. It is certainly possible that Putin invoked the NATO threat in an effort to disguise ulterior motives (e.g., recreating the Soviet Union), but to make that assumption is to overlook longstanding Russian fears.\n\nThe fact that NATO placed a \u201cdefensive\u201d shield of anti-ballistic missiles in former Warsaw Pact nations\u2014ostensibly to shoot down nuclear weapons launched by Iran\u2014was particularly anathema to Russia. From the Russian point of view, the West sought to give itself impunity to launch a nuclear attack without Russia being able to retaliate (since its missiles would be shot down). This would give the West so-called \u201cfirst-strike capability.\u201d The fact that the U.S. proceeded to withdraw from one arms-control treaty after another\u2014ABM, the INF, the Open Skies Treaty\u2014only intensified Russian fears (to be fair, the U.S. and NATO have accused Russians of any number of treaty violations; this is not simply a \u201cWest is malicious\u201d scenario, nor is it simply a \u201cRussia is malicious\u201d scenario).\n\nThe latter two treaty withdrawals, incidentally, were decisions by Putin\u2019s ostensible best friend, Donald Trump, who was also the first president to send \u201clethal aid\u201d (mostly meaning Javelin anti-tank missiles) to Ukraine, thus overturning Obama\u2019s decision not to do so for fear of worsening tensions and arming neo-Nazi \u201cthugs.\u201d Trump, too\u2014contrary to popular perceptions\u2014ramped up economic sanctions beyond Congressional mandates, causing Putin to believe that the West was waging economic war. Whether those sanctions were justified is a question I\u2019ll put aside for now; what is likely, however, is that they did more harm than good.\n\nWe can argue about whether Russian leaders are/were irrational to think that the West is out to get them, but it\u2019s unquestionably true that\u2019s what many of them thought and continue to think. Those fears led Russia to develop hypersonic nuclear-tipped missiles that the West thus far cannot defend against. They also led Russia to attack Georgia in 2008 in a five-day war initiated by Georgia\u2019s illegal attempt to reclaim a breakaway region called South Ossetia. This is a war that Russia\u2019s detractors cite as evidence that Putin is ruthless and seeks to recreate the Soviet Union. The actuality was a great deal more complex, and did not end with Russia annexing Georgia (though it continues to pose a military threat to Georgia).\n\nNor will Russia annex Ukraine, despite what we hear in the media. Its troops aren\u2019t positioned to capture the whole of Ukraine, much less occupy it. The objective seems to be to destroy Ukraine\u2019s military capabilities and to carve off a part of eastern Ukraine in order to attach Crimea to Russia by land and to better defend the Donbas. One would never know this from watching CNN, but, according to U.S. military and intelligence officials, Russian forces\u2014despite inflicting enormous carnage\u2014have been deliberately restrained in order to give room for diplomacy. The other objective seems to be precisely what Putin has stated: to ensure that Ukraine does not become a member of NATO. Nor am I willing to entirely discredit Putin\u2019s statement that he seeks to \u201cde-Nazify\u201d Ukraine (more on that later), given the Azov Battalion\u2019s role in attacks on the Donbas.\n\nStill, as my colleagues insist, this is Putin\u2019s war. He made an illegal decision to invade a sovereign nation. He and his supporters deserve whatever they get. Yes, but no, that\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nEven in the early 2000s, the NED/NGO complex had gone to work to turn Ukraine into a pro-Western nation. After NATO\u2019s decision in 2008 to encourage Ukraine\u2019s admission (I say \u201cencourage admission\u201d because, to reiterate, Ukrainians themselves opposed it), the fight for Ukrainian hearts and minds became more fraught, with pro-Western forces competing against Russophones to elect a favorable government. This was an inherently destabilizing situation.\n\nA turning point came in 2010, when Ukraine elected Viktor Yanukovych as president. Though considered pro-Russian, he strongly favored integrating Ukraine\u2019s economy with the European Union, partly by negotiating an EU economic bailout package. In 2013, however, he turned down the EU\u2019s offer because it required austerity measures that would shred Ukraine\u2019s social safety net and, arguably, because it contained strict anti-corruption requirements (Ukraine is awash in corruption). When Russia offered its own bailout deal sans austerity and anti-corruption measures and with guaranteed access to cheap natural gas, Yanukovych accepted, triggering his right-wing opponents to accuse him of making secret concessions (presumably involving control of Ukraine\u2019s gas pipelines).\n\nWhat often got lost in coverage of the ensuing protests was that Yanukovych\u2019s Russia deal protected industrial jobs in Ukraine\u2019s eastern \u201cRust Belt\u201d that might well disappear under the EU package. Nor did Western coverage give much attention to Russia\u2019s fears that cheap EU imports would undermine its fragile economy. Not surprisingly, the strongly pro-free enterprise NED/NGO complex went to work to undermine Yanukovych by working closely with the leaders of the Maidan revolution.\n\nThe U.S. and its NED/NGO apparatus did not create the Maidan phenomenon, to be sure, but did steer it to their own ends. Multiple U.S. officials\u2014including Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and Republican John McCain\u2014met with members of the far-right Svoboda party to affirm their support for Maidan. The equivalent would be Russian leaders meeting directly with, say, January 6 insurrectionaries. The staunchly neoconservative Assistant Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, moreover, called Geoffrey Pyatt, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine to instruct him about which Ukrainians the U.S. wanted in President Yanukovych\u2019s ministry and which ones the U.S. wanted excluded. Nuland in particular recommended Arseniy Yatsenyuk (\u201cYats is the guy who\u2019s got the economic experience,\u201d she says in the leaked audio of the call). After Maidan forces forced Yanukovych to flee the country (even after he had called new elections), Yatsenyuk became president. In a space of five months, Yatsenyuk nixed the Russia bailout deal, resuscitated the EU package (including austerity), and resigned.\n\nDid Maidan amount to a U.S.-endorsed coup? Was Nuland promoting Yatsenyuk for the role of president? We\u2019re told that the idea that the U.S. supported a coup in Ukraine is Russian disinformation, but are we sure? What precisely did Geoffrey Pyatt mean by \u201c[we need] somebody with an international personality to come out here and help to midwife this thing.\u201d Did Pyatt require a high-profile Western leader to visit Ukraine merely to endorse a ministerial shuffle? Or was the U.S. playing a bigger game? At the very least, the U.S. was meddling in Ukraine\u2019s politics to impose its will.\n\nIn supporting the Maidan project, the U.S. found a ready ally not just in the professorial accountant, Yatsenyuk, but also in Ukraine\u2019s energetic far-right, which provided shock troops\u2014militants\u2014in the protests in Kyiv and elsewhere. After those protests succeeded, the new government repealed a law allowing Russian as an official language in Eastern Ukraine, outlawed left-wing political parties (due to their sympathy with Russia) and outright banned and/or greatly curtailed books imported from Russia. Right-wing thugs meanwhile attacked left-wing political gatherings and drove them underground while the Ukrainian government looked the other way. NED\u2019s president, Carl Gershwin (prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to neo-con Jeanne Kirkpatrick of the Reagan administration) openly boasted that Maidan was a first step toward ousting Putin. This sort of statement fell short of optimal diplomacy, but was, and is, ubiquitous among Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment (aka, \u201cthe Blob\u201d).\n\nShortly after Maidan\u2014and the violence and repression that followed\u2014the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine passed referendums demanding (depending on how one translates) either to be fully independent or at least autonomous (the latter would be akin to creating Ukrainian federalism akin to that of the United States). There is little question that the referendums were replete with irregularities and coercion and lacked legitimacy under Ukrainian law. It\u2019s equally clear that much of the Donbas population\u2014with equal justification\u2014believed the Maidan government to be illegal (Yanukovych, after all, had prevailed in a fair election) and were infuriated by the Maidan government\u2019s attacks on separatists.\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, poured $2.5 billion into Ukraine\u2019s military seeking to modernize it, partly so it could recapture the breakaway states. The CIA began training Ukrainians to fight in the Donbas in 2015. Though it performed poorly in the early days, the Ukrainian army, along with right-wing paramilitary forces (there were 102,000 of them as of 2020), soon began inflicting agonies. In the war that followed, some 14,000 died between 2014 and 2022. According to the U.N., 81% of civilian casualties were in rebel-held areas between 2018 and 2021, a time when cease-fire agreements supposedly existed in accordance with Minsk protocols. To be sure, civilian casualties had diminished steeply from 2014-15, but cease-fire violations were numerous, and it was Ukrainian attackers who were mostly in violation.\n\nAn aside here on Ukrainian neo-Nazis who played roles in both the Maidan revolution and the fighting in the Donbas: There\u2019s a concerted effort afoot to paint them as selfless patriots who either never were genuine Nazis, or who have given up their ideology, or who represent but a tiny sliver of Ukraine\u2019s population. Examine reporting on those same right-wing zealots from before the Russian invasion and you\u2019ll find a different picture.\n\nIn 2020, Tim Lister of the U.S. Military Academy\u2019s Combating Terrorism Center had this to say: \u201cIn recent years, some Americans and Europeans drawn to various brands of far-right nationalism have looked to Ukraine as their field of dreams: a country with a well-established, trained, and equipped far-right militia\u2014the Azov Regiment\u2014that has been actively engaged in the conflict against Russian-backed separatists in Donbas. Most of these \u2018foreign fighters\u2019 appear to travel as individuals and at their own expense, according to the author\u2019s review of many cases, but there is a broader relationship between the Ukrainian far-right, and especially its political flagship the National Corps, and a variety of far-right groups and individuals in the United States and Europe.\u201d\n\nThough the U.S. theoretically bars arms shipments to Ukraine\u2019s right-wing militias, there is no way to know precisely where the massive influx of arms will go (just as there was no way to stop U.S. arms shipments from flowing to Al Nusra in Syria or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan). You can find more now pass\u00e9 and impolitic warnings about Ukraine\u2019s Nazis here, here, here, here, and here. Also, here, here, here, and here. And here, too. And here, here, here, and here. And here and here and here. The U.S. policy of flooding Ukraine with arms, in short, might well strengthen (and embolden) far-right constituencies throughout Eastern Europe, and possibly Western Europe.\n\nTo end the fighting, Ukraine, Russia, the Donbas states, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) hammered out the Minsk I and Minsk II accords in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Both created a path for the breakaway regions to gain autonomous status. The Ukrainian right, however\u2014which continued to pour fighters into the Donbas\u2014refused to honor the terms and the Ukrainian government did little to restrain them. Though President Zelensky demanded that right-wing militias leave the Donbas as a preliminary to making peace with Russia, he was met with adamant refusal as well as threats on his life. Since then, he has decided to work with the far-right. Ethnic Russians in the Donbas also violated the accords. Both sides, according to the U.N., abducted and tortured opponents, though the most gratuitous crime was committed by pro-Maidan forces that in 2014 set fire to a trade union building in Odessa, killing over 40 anti-Maidan protestors.\n\nSo, why did Putin and Russia wait to attack Ukraine until 2022, fully eight years after Russia annexed Crimea and the Donbas declared independence? Putin claims\u2014not without evidence\u2014that Ukraine was planning an offensive to reclaim Crimea and the Donbas. How did he know? Partly because President Zelensky had announced his intention to do so in 2021. Then\u2014in summer 2022, presumably\u2014Ukraine would join NATO as a full member. Zelensky announced that, too, in a tweet he later deleted (Zelensky, incidentally, asked the U.S. to say once and for all whether Ukraine would be allowed into NATO. He was told that no, probably not, but for appearances sake the answer was yes. Some observers suggest that the U.S., by leaving the door open, was deliberately luring Putin into war.) Once Ukraine joined NATO, Russia would have faced an Article 5 war against NATO to defend either the Donbas or its annexed territory in Crimea. Article 5 is the article in NATO\u2019s charter stipulating that a war against one member is a war against all, and that all will defend the one. Russia had zero prospect of winning such a war short of using nuclear weapons.\n\nThat alone, however, did not precipitate immediate attack. Putin massed forces on Ukraine\u2019s border in the hope of forcing Ukraine and the West to agree to Ukraine\u2019s neutrality (that is, a guarantee that Ukraine would not join NATO). He was also reacting to Ukraine\u2019s violation of the Minsk accords, including an increase in shelling and the use of weaponized drones. President Zelensky\u2019s stated willingness to pursue nuclear weapons undoubtedly figured in Putin\u2019s thinking, too.\n\nAccording to CIA sources, Putin\u2019s decision to attack Ukraine was made at the last minute, after his diplomatic overtures (which included direct talks with European leaders) failed. In other words, contrary to endless assertions in our media, the attack on Ukraine was not a long-planned decision meant to recreate the Soviet Union.\n\nIf Putin was correct\u2014if Ukraine intended to recapture Crimea and the Donbas, then promptly sign on with NATO\u2014his decision to invade was a preemptive strategy. That is not to say he lacked peaceful options. He could have recognized the Donbas states and stationed troops in them without embarking on a wholesale invasion. Alternately, he could have continued to seek support for the Minsk protocols, especially given that the Donbas holds limited economic and strategic importance to Russia and is an enormous drain on the Russian treasury. It is harder, however, to imagine Putin surrendering Russia\u2019s strategically important Black Sea naval base at Sevastopol (Crimea), which Ukraine would hand over to NATO. An apt analogy would be Cuba handing over the American base at Guantanamo to Russia. The U.S. would never allow it.\n\nWhatever his options, he declared a war. No doubt you have noticed, given that the U.S. media spent more time covering the Ukraine war in the last month than it spent in any previous month on any war in the past 31 years, including Iraq. Either a certain news-obsessed demographic of Americans is utterly fixated on the war, or the media really really wants Americans to care about it. Or both.\n\nThat observation becomes more interesting when one considers that, according to a Rasmussen poll, support for direct U.S. involvement correlates with income. The wealthier you are, the more likely you are to support U.S. involvement (at least in the hypothetical situation that the war escalates beyond Ukraine). Wealth tracks with whiteness and educational attainment, which, in turn, tracks with the mainstream media\u2019s main clientele: prosperous white Americans who grew up during the Cold War. Mind you, the mainstream media\u2019s coverage isn\u2019t falsified; it\u2019s simply credulous. It routinely reports faulty and/or speculative intelligence that the U.S. puts out for PR and strategic purposes, not to mention self-serving Ukrainian assertions that lack independent verification. That\u2019s not to say that mainstream coverage is always wrong; it\u2019s mostly just frenetic and fulsome. But don\u2019t even think about calling it propaganda.\n\nI find the situation frightening and deplorable. Frightening because any direct involvement by U.S. forces could escalate into nuclear war, starting with Russia\u2019s use of tactical nuclear weapons (which it has in abundance) to stop troop flows and arms shipments. Deplorable because the U.S. (and British) media have stoked an inferno of self-righteous rage, all in support of a country that has little strategic significance to the United States (or Britain).\n\nYes, I pity Ukrainians, who are being slaughtered by Russia\u2019s war machine. I hope the Ukrainians win without a prolonged bloodbath. But no, I do not believe that Ukraine\u2019s defeat would lead Russia to attack NATO or recreate the Soviet Union. As the scholar John Mearsheimer has noted, those are fables that Western policy elites tell themselves to deny their own culpability. Nor do I think that guaranteeing that Ukraine will remain neutral, rather than join NATO, will encourage China to think \u201caha, we can attack Taiwan and the U.S. will stay out of it!\u201d Such stories\u2014that diplomacy will make the U.S. \u201clook weak\u201d\u2014are endlessly recycled in every single conflict we enter, which is partly why we stayed in Vietnam and Afghanistan long after any conceivable progress was achievable.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re going to care about Ukraine, maybe we should also start caring about Yemen, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have died miserable deaths due to Saudi Arabia\u2019s attack on a sovereign nation, or about Syria, where our own occupying forces and proxies have displaced 7.1 million people and perpetuated a war that has cost more than 600,000 lives and untold misery (not least due to crippling Western sanctions that starve and impoverish millions), or about our own war crimes in Iraq, where our invasion led directly to the violent deaths of between 184,382 and 207,168 civilians (and hundreds of thousands more indirectly), or Libya, where NATO\u2019s regime change operation turned the most prosperous country in Africa into a fratricidal warlord state with open slave markets.\n\nOur press gives us wall-to-wall images of suffering in Ukraine, including images of bombed-out buildings and murdered civilians that attest to \u201cgenocide.\u201d If one wants to see equally convincing attestations to genocide, take a look at images of Fallujah, Iraq, where the U.S. and allied forces used white phosphorous and cluster bombs (and buried corpses, including some tied and shot, in mass graves) and destroyed 36,000 homes, 60 schools, and 65 mosques. Or, look at Mosul, Iraq, after the U.S. leveled it, with a nary a mention of civilian corpses. Or, Raqqa, Syria.\n\nRussia isn\u2019t the only nation that commits wartime atrocities.\n\nWhich brings us to the question: why does the West hate Putin so much? I have zero doubt that Putin is an autocrat who can be ruthless (as witnessed by the 1999 bombing of Grozny, which the West ambivalently condemned). Nor do I doubt that Russia, like the U.S., but on a smaller scale, meddles in other countries\u2019 elections for strategic purposes (though what Russia did in our 2016 election has been grossly overstated and misrepresented). I am inclined to think, too, though evidence isn\u2019t iron-clad, Putin has approved the assassinations of turncoat spies and journalists. All that is likely true. And yet the U.S. supports ally nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that are far more authoritarian than Putin\u2019s Russia. Nor is Ukraine itself innocent of human rights abuses, including torture, murder, and political repression. What, then, makes us hate Putin so much?\n\nThe answer is threefold. First, Russia\u2019s 2015 intervention in Syria on behalf of its longtime ally, Bashir Assad, ramped up tensions to new heights. The U.S.\u2014which was spending a billion dollars a year to arm supposedly \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d rightly condemned Assad and Russia for war crimes but had little or no interest in atrocities by their own proxies. Because the press focused on Syrian/Russian atrocities, moreover, the American public gained little understanding of Russian motives (namely, to protect their longtime military base in Syria and to prevent a Daesh-type government from replacing Assad).\n\nThen\u2014on the heels of Russian entry into the Syrian conflict\u2014came the Russiagate furor, which was repeatedly distorted and exaggerated by venues like MSNBC, CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, for whom Russiagate was a financial windfall. Amid the blizzard of hyperbolic punditry, 67% of Democrats came to believe that Russia had actually changed vote totals in the 2016 presidential election. The impeachment sagas of 2018 and 2020 more firmly linked Russiagate to the cause of Ukrainians whom Trump stood accused of endangering. The U.S. must arm Ukrainians in their fight against Russia, intoned impeachment lawyer Pamela Karlin, so that \u201cwe don't have to fight them here\u201d (even as the Minsk Accords, in theory, remained in effect). Any number of Congressional Democrats joined her chorus of Red Dawn-style hyperbole.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile\u2014despite their anger over the false Russiagate charges\u2014never really abandoned their Cold War mentality. After Russia invaded Ukraine, they were more than happy to resurrect Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 contention that Russia remained our country\u2019s greatest nemesis. It wasn\u2019t, but the ubiquity of Russophobia among foreign policy elites made his statement self-fulfilling. Lindsay Graham and John McCain\u2014long the GOP\u2019s and most eager and strident hawks\u2014personally advanced Romney\u2019s Cold War narrative by visiting Ukraine in 2017, where they promised to help Ukrainian troops prosecute their war against separatists. When Russia launched its invasion, the GOP finally had its 1980s foreign policy back.\n\nWhat all this leads up to is simply this: if Americans who fly Ukrainian flags actually want to help Ukrainians, they would be well advised to support diplomatic negotiations rather than limitless flows of weaponry. It is highly unlikely that Putin will withdraw without a negotiated settlement that would include a promise that Ukraine will not join NATO, as well as some guarantee that the Ukraine will recognize Crimea as part of Russia and grant autonomy to the Donbas. What Russia might provide, in return, would be war reparations (couched as \u201ceconomic aid\u201d) and recognition of Kosovo. Using Ukrainian proxies to fight for regime change in Russia may seem emotionally satisfying but doesn\u2019t offer a path to peace.",

            "channel": "prospectmagazine.co.uk",
            "text": "Two months on from the start of the war, Russia seems no closer to achieving its original aims. Even if taken at face value, the recent announcement that the goal is now the capture of Donbas and southern Ukrainian territory, creating a land bridge from Crimea, is a dramatic climbdown from the original goals of conquering the whole country, effecting regime change, and forcing Nato to retreat to the force posture of the mid-1990s.\n\nRevising goals downward so early in a war of choice is, of course, a sign that the Kremlin thinks things are going badly. And there is every reason to think that things are going to get significantly worse for Putin.\n\nFrom the start of the war, western analysis has highlighted the Russian army\u2019s apparent problems with logistics, communication, equipment, training and morale. All of these are issues that could in theory be fixed, greatly improving Russia\u2019s capacity to fight the war. But there are two immediate problems with this. The first is the impact of sanctions, which will continue to put pressure on Russian finances, ultimately limiting the Kremlin\u2019s capacity to spend its way out of the difficulty. Sanctions also pose a challenge to attempts to resupply and repair\u2014let alone upgrade\u2014equipment, because they cover military and technology sales.\n\nThe second problem is time. Russian personnel and equipment losses have been enormous. Repairing and building new vehicles, planes and helicopters is a slow process, and it takes many years to replace lost warships. It also takes time to adequately train soldiers to replace the many thousands killed and wounded. Russia appears to be losing men and weapons more quickly than it can replace them; unless this changes, it spells defeat.\n\nBut even if the Kremlin were able to overcome these problems, there are two further, fundamental challenges concerning the conduct of the war and its aims that are entirely outside its control. These mean Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine will continue to fail.\n\nThe first is that the west seems committed to supplying Ukraine with military assistance for the foreseeable future. The scale of this aid is staggering. The United States alone has provided or pledged $3.4bn in military assistance since the start of the war, including $1.6bn in the last two weeks alone; the top ten countries providing military aid have collectively pledged nearly $6bn. It is impossible for Russia to compete with this.\n\nBeyond the headline figures, the specifics of western aid should also be deeply worrying for the Kremlin. The most obvious problem for Putin is that aid is seemingly being tailored to address the changing character of the war. The UK government, for example, has announced that it will \u201cbackfill\u201d Polish tank capacity, supplying Poland with tanks that will enable the country to supply its own tanks to Ukraine. Like the recent announcement that the US will provide armoured personnel carriers and howitzers, this seems designed to help Ukraine in the fight for its eastern territory.\n\nEarly in the war, concerns about the risk of escalation appeared to be limiting the types of western aid provided to Ukraine. The Kremlin attempted to increase this anxiety, and so choke off the aid supply, by announcing that western supply convoys would be regarded as legitimate targets and by making ominous, if vague, noises about nuclear weapons. The latest round of pledges from western donors suggests that these threats may be causing less concern than previously, or that that they carry less weight because the will to support Ukraine has strengthened. Either is very bad news for Putin, since this was almost the only lever that he could pull to try to slow or stop aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe public acknowledgement by western leaders that the war could last for years is an important signal that they are not shaping policy in expectation of a quick resolution; they are preparing their populations for a long-term commitment to Ukraine. Any hopes that Putin may have pinned on nervousness about this would seem to be misplaced.\n\nThis means that Russia, with its capacity to wage war significantly degraded by the first two months of fighting and with limited (and declining) scope to reverse its losses, will have to deal with an opponent benefitting from a seemingly open-ended supply of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of weapons. That is not sustainable.\n\nThere is a second fundamental issue that Putin is unable to control. In aiming to weaken the west and turn the European strategic clock back, he has triggered the opposite outcome. Although differences inevitably remain, western states look much more united than they have at any point this century, and much more focused on strengthening military capacity in the face of Russian threats. It now looks possible that despite their long histories of neutrality, Finland and Sweden will join Nato. This would be a strategic disaster and a profound humiliation for Russia. Threats intended to prevent their accession seem to be having the reverse effect. Whatever short-term gains the Russian army may make by reducing cities like Mariupol to ruins, the medium- and long-term prospects look disastrous for Putin, and he appears powerless to do anything about it.",

            "text": "Russia-Ukraine War: Is The World Witnessing Another \u2018Cold War\u2019 Era?\n\nBy Mukhtar Ya\u2019u Madobi\n\nOf course, it was true, which is hard to believe. We have been hearing about the first and second world wars and how they were fought, because we never had a chance to witness any of them. Nevertheless, in what appears to be akin to a recipe for the third world war, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin had in Late February authorized a \u2018special military operation\u2019 against the neighboring country, Ukraine. This is to press home his demands about Russia\u2019s refusal to allow Ukraine join the United States and European military alliance, known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.\n\nThe Russian forces have so far invaded the country, seized many cities, strategic institutions and facilities that are very crucial to Ukraine as a corporate nation. Alas, a lot of people have been killed, wounded while a host of others were sent packing as refugees around the border of neighboring countries. The situation has really led to a critical emergency response as the UN stated that more than 3million Ukrainians have currently plunged into deep humanitarian crises and are in dire need of assistance.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the war, the Russian Federation had for months stationed a large number of troops around the Ukraine border as a precautionary measure for any attempt by the NATO forces to establish their presence in Ukraine. A lot of efforts have been made through mediation by international organizations to avert this unfortunate experience, but no light was found at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThis is due to the obsession of the Ukraine President, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky obsession to join forces with NATO as well as the latter\u2019s long term ambition to also expand their geographical reach downward the eastern Europe so as to establish proximity to Russia by creating a military base in an ally country, specifically the presently war-torn Ukraine.\n\nA lot of pundits, which I shared the same view with, argued that Zelensky was thoughtless to have engaged his country into war with Russia, a fight which he knows clearly that he never stood a chance of winning due to superior military spirits of Russia. Because, the Russian military forces put at 1,014,000 with reserve forces of 2,000,000 are five times greater than Ukrainian military forces of 200,000 and reservists of 500,000. Thus, it is obvious that the latter is no match for the former.\n\nEven though I wasn\u2019t born, from what I have read in history, the present Ukrainian situation is just a replica of the olden days \u2018cold war\u2019 between the two world \u2018super powers\u2019 i.e. the defunct Soviet Union (presently Russia) and the United State of America. It is obvious that they are now fighting a proxy war thereby using Ukraine as a battle ground to flex their muscles and showcase their military prowess.\n\nLet me flash our memories a little back to the era of cold war for the purpose of adequate comprehension of this article.\n\nAfter the Second World War ended with the defeat of Germany, Japan and Italy in the hands of the alliance comprising mainly Great Britain, Soviet Russia and the USA. The United States with its economic wealth and military strength, no doubt, made a matchless contribution to the victory in the War and it was felt that its strengths and leadership would be needed to maintain peace in the post-War world, too. Having contributed significantly to the victory in the war, Soviet Russia was not to be sidelined; the country claimed equal say in deciding on European problems.\n\nNevertheless, not so long after this gentlemen\u2019s agreement, the US and the Soviet Union developed differences about working together for the peace and stability of Europe. There were political and ideological reasons for these differences. The US practiced and preached \u2018democracy\u2019 and \u2018free market\u2019 enterprise as the desirable model of governance, while the Soviet Union believed and practiced governance by a single (communist) party and of state-controlled economy.\n\nThese differences led to feelings of one being threatened by the other. So began the bipolar phase in the world order immediately after the War. The United States and the Soviet Union stood out as two opposite poles around which, to begin with, European politics revolved. While the countries of Western Europe joined hands with the US and called themselves the \u201cFree World\u201d, countries of Eastern Europe became part of the Socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. These two leading countries of rival camps were clubbed under the exclusive, new category of \u201csuper powers\u201d.\n\nRelations between East and West were never cordial. Short of going to war directly, the two camps indulged constantly in political and military competition. This state of affairs was widely called the \u201cCold War\u201d. The Cold War was marked by a great deal of competition in forming military alliances, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO).\n\nNATO was formed in 1949 with the United States, Canada and 10 countries in Western Europe including Belgium, Britain, Netherlands, West Germany, France etc. The Soviet Union then cleverly offered to join the alliance, but NATO turned down the offer because NATO\u2019s real purpose was to stop the spread of the Soviet influence and ideology.\n\nAs a result, the Soviet Union set up in 1955 its own military grouping, the WTO with its allies in Eastern Europe to counter NATO. The original members are; Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania.\n\nHowever, the Soviet Union broke up into the Russian Federation and 14 other Republics in 1991 and the WTO was equally disbanded. All these new states abandoned socialism and embraced Western ideology of \u2018democracy\u2019 and \u2018free market economy\u2019. For example, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland joined NATO on March 12 March 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia joined in March 2004 and Albania joined on 1 April 2009.\n\nIt was regarded as a grand victory for the US as it has recorded victory in the Cold War and it became an object of both admiration and fear. The US became the single remaining super power with the fall of socialism and breakup of the Soviet Union\n\nSo going back to our previous discussion, it is obviously simple to understand why Russia invaded Ukraine all of sudden. It is apparent that NATO-US would have the right to establish a military base in Ukraine soil immediately when it joins the alliance. And this gives them proximity to Russia, which is one of the vicious thorns in their flesh.\n\nIt can be recalled that the US invaded Cuba in 1961 because the Soviet wanted to build a military base in that country. Cuba is a few miles away from the US and the latter felt threatened by the Russian presence back then. So why should NATO and the US now build a military base in Ukraine which is also a few miles away from Moscow, the capital city of Russia? Putin is not stupid. He clearly knows that the moment NATO/US enters Ukraine and establishes a military base, then Russia is vulnerable to attack anytime.\n\nAdditionally, NATO and US breached the 1990 treaty which prevented NATO and US from expanding eastwards of Europe from the then East Germany. As of today, NATO establishes its presence almost everywhere in eastern Europe including Croatia, Poland and other places that are closer to Russia. Thus, getting closer to Russia means NATO and US missiles can strike Moscow very quickly without wasting time.\n\nOver the years, as a result of their vested interests, US-NATO forces have been playing a vital role in creating tensions among various countries in the world. Recall that in 2011, NATO and French forces ransacked Libya and killed Colonel Muammar Ghaddafi of blessed memory. Libya that used to be a prosperous nation has now reduced to a poverty and war-ravaged country in Africa.\n\nAlso, US single-handedly invaded Iraq in 1990, bombed the country and also killed Saddam Hussein, the President. America claimed to have acted on \u2018credible intelligence\u2019 which turned out to be false, saying that Iraq had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction and up to now, none of such was found. Today Iraq lies in ruins with no sober government.\n\nAdditionally, they also pounded on Syria and nearly overthrew its President, Bashar Al-Asaad if not because of Russia\u2019s intervention. For over decade, Syria has been shattered and turned to safe haven, swarmed by criminal elements including terrorists.\n\nAs of today, Afghanistan that used to be a peaceful nation has now become stateless after so many years of war occasioned by the presence of the US after the Russians have left. Today Afghanistan is a total mess.\n\nAs it stands now, US and NATO have started sending military logistics to allied nations which will apparently sneak their way into Ukraine. This is dangerous and it might prove the assertion by Russia that NATO and US wants to enter Ukraine so that it can launch attacks on Russian soil.\n\nBelieve me, when this happens, those staunch allies to Russia including China, India, Syria, Iran, the defiant boy of North Korea and others will surely waste no time in coming to its aid. In fact, North Korea has already started testing ballistic missiles and would be ready to shell her close rival and US ally, South Korea at the glimpse of an opportunity.\n\nSo, is the Third World War knocking on our doors?\n\nHonestly, US and NATO unwarranted activities should be checked, if not, they might wake up one day and decide to replace the government of any country they deem fit with another.\n\nMeanwhile NATO and US should cast aside their greediness of expanding eastward of Europe, especially toward Russia as a mark of respect for the treaty they signed earlier on that regard.\n\nTo the inexperienced Zelensky of Ukraine, who allowed himself to be brainwashed by turning his country into a battlefield for NATO/US and Russian forces, the earlier he shelves his interest in joining that military alliance, the better for him and his country as he never stands a chance of emerging victorious against Russia.\n\nBecause, none of NATO/US forces will engage in direct physical confrontations with fully nuclear missiles armed Russia as a result of the known consequences that might accompany such recklessness.",

            "text": "Placeholder while article actions load\n\nThe United Nations secretary general called this week for an Easter truce between Russia and Ukraine. Orthodox Christians in both countries observe Easter on Sunday. But as the fighting continued to rage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow on Thursday of rejecting the U.N. proposal. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Russia\u2019s invasion has roiled global markets, revived the NATO alliance and triggered war crimes investigations. It has also opened a rift in the Orthodox Church, pitting the Russian wing and its pro-Kremlin patriarch against Orthodox leaders in Kyiv and around the globe.\n\nOrthodox Christianity is one of the largest Christian communions in the world \u2014 after Catholicism and the Protestant church. Most of its roughly 260 million adherents are concentrated in Europe, Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union.\n\nDespite the ongoing Russian invasion of their country, Ukrainians celebrated Orthodox Easter on April 24. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nIt is the dominant faith in both Russia and Ukraine, where the status of the church has become a source of tension between Moscow and Kyiv. For Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally in the church, Patriarch Kirill, Ukraine is an inseparable part of a greater Russian world \u2014 one with Moscow as its political center and Kyiv as its spiritual hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this, Kirill, 75, has offered a full-throated endorsement of the war, doubling down even as the world recoils at widespread reports of Russian atrocities in Ukraine. His pro-war stance has angered other church leaders, in Ukraine and across the Orthodox faith, many of whom have condemned the war and urged Kirill to reconsider his support.\n\nAs the Orthodox world celebrates its Easter holiday Sunday, here\u2019s how the tensions within the church are playing out:\n\nRussian Orthodox Church\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is one of the largest and most influential in the world, with more than 100 million followers, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2009, Kirill was elected patriarch \u2014 the first since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nAt first, Kirill was seen as a modernizer who might carve out some independence for the church, after his predecessor, Alexiy II, used his political ties to raise the church\u2019s profile after decades of atheist communism. Russian politicians bankrolled the construction of new churches, and religious leaders appeared front and center at state functions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, however, Kirill has solidified his role as an ally of the Kremlin, helping Putin cloak his political and military ambitions in the language of faith.\n\nOn Feb. 23, one day before the invasion, Kirill released a statement praising Putin for his \u201chigh and responsible service to the people of Russia\u201d and describing mandatory military service as \u201can active manifestation of evangelical love for neighbors.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since the war started, Kirill has used his sermons to justify the campaign, portraying it as a struggle against sinful Western culture \u2014 although he is careful to avoid referring to the conflict as a war or invasion that was launched by Russia.\n\nHe has focused almost entirely on what he calls Ukraine\u2019s \u201cextermination\u201d of pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region in the eastern part of the country. Earlier this month, Kirill delivered a sermon urging Russians to rally around the government \u201cduring this difficult time,\u201d the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet the Lord help us unite during this difficult time for our Fatherland, including around the authorities,\u201d the Interfax news agency quoted Kirill as saying at a sermon in Moscow.\n\nUkrainian Orthodox Church \u2014 Moscow Patriarchate\n\nThe vast majority of Ukrainians identify as Orthodox Christian, according to Pew. Their loyalties, however, are split between at least two major ecclesiastical bodies, one being the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is \u201cself-governing\u201d but remains under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nFor centuries, churches in Ukraine and Russia were both under the leadership of the Moscow patriarch. However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the church in Ukraine pressed for \u2014 and obtained \u2014 semiautonomous status in 1990.\n\nBut in recent years, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine, an increasing number of Ukrainian followers have sought to counter what they see as Moscow\u2019s influence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the invasion, those calls have intensified \u2014 and parishioners have grown angry over the Russian Orthodox Church\u2019s support for the war. All of this has put the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its leader, Metropolitan Onuphury, in a precarious position, particularly as reports of civilian massacres and other atrocities mount.\n\nOn Feb. 24, the day of the invasion, Onuphury released a statement calling the military campaign a \u201cdisaster\u201d and appealing to Putin to \u201cimmediately stop the fratricidal war.\u201d\n\nThe war between Russians and Ukrainians \u201cis a repetition of the sin of Cain, who killed his own brother out of envy,\u201d Onuphury said. \u201cSuch a war has no justification either from God or from people.\u201d\n\nThe church has emphasized its role in providing assistance to civilians and presiding over the burial of Ukrainian service members. Some priests have stopped commemorating Kirill in their services or have called on Onuphury to break away from Moscow entirely.\n\nOrthodox Church of Ukraine\n\nThe Orthodox Church of Ukraine is three years old. Its founding was the direct result of the burgeoning movement to peel away from the Russian Orthodox Church and create a purely independent ecclesiastical entity for Ukraine. The church\u2019s recognition by the patriarchate in Turkey angered Moscow, and the Russian Orthodox Church severed its ties with that body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leader of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine is Metropolitan Epiphanius, 43, who has been vocal in his criticism of Putin and the war. Soon after the invasion, Epiphanius released a statement likening the Russian leader to both the Antichrist and Adolf Hitler.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of the Antichrist operates in the leader of Russia, the signs of which the Scriptures reveal to us: pride, devotion to evil, ruthlessness, false religiosity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was Hitler during World War II. This is what Putin has become today.\u201d\n\nThis week, after he visited the devastated city of Chernihiv, Epiphanius urged Ukrainians to continue to fight the Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cSeeing the suffering, destruction, brutal violence and spread of death that Russia brings to every corner of Ukraine ... we understand even better that only the fight against the aggressor [and] his expulsion from our land can bring us a just peace,\u201d he said.\n\nEcumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is one of the world\u2019s oldest institutions. The Orthodox Church has no single leader, but Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is considered its spiritual guide and \u201cfirst among equals\u201d with the other patriarchs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBartholomew has been critical of Moscow and the war, and of Kirill and the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nOn the first day of the invasion, he condemned what he said was an \u201cunprovoked attack by Russia against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nLater, in an interview with CNN Turk, he defended his decision to grant autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and warned that Russia\u2019s aggression and isolation could lead to a \u201cnew Cold War.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole world is against Russia,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cThe distance between Russia and the Western world is getting bigger. It means that we are entering a new Cold War period.\u201d\n\nThe patriarchate has delivered humanitarian aid to the church in Kyiv. On a visit to Poland in late March, Bartholomew denounced the invasion as an \u201catrocious\u201d act.\n\n\u201cIt is simply impossible to imagine how much devastation this atrocious invasion has caused for the Ukrainian people and the entire world,\u201d Bartholomew said at a news briefing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe added that solidarity with Ukrainians \u201cis the only thing that can overcome evil and darkness in the world.\u201d\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "By Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA)\n\nBy Bipandeep Sharma*\n\nThe Arctic region witnessed extensive militarisation during the Second World War. In the Cold War period, despite military exercises conducted by rival blocks\u2014the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact countries\u2014the Arctic remained stable without any confrontation. In fact, the 196-km border between the Soviet Union and Norway (the only NATO-member country to share a border with the Soviet Union) remained peaceful throughout the Cold War. In 1987, with the Cold War in its end-phase, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in his famous \u2018Murmansk Speech\u2019, called for the Arctic as a \u2018Zone of Peace\u2019 and emphasised the need for cooperation in the region. 1\n\nGorbachev\u2019s vision was reciprocated by the West. The first environmental cooperative initiative, called the \u2018Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy\u2019 (AEPS), was signed by eight Arctic states in 1991.2 AEPS was the initiative of government of Finland that resulted in successful conclusion of various cooperative measures to protect the Arctic environment. 3 These eight Arctic states in 1996 signed the Ottawa Declaration which led to the establishment of the Arctic Council.4 Since its formation, the Arctic Council has become an important forum for addressing issues of environment, sustainable development and purveying the socio-economic context in the region.5 The Arctic Council is the most important intergovernmental forum for cooperation between the Arctic states in the high north. The working of the Arctic Council is executed through its six working groups and the decision making within the Council is based on \u2018consensus basis\u2019.\n\nIn February 2022, as a result of Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine, the seven Western Arctic states (A7), 6 five of which are members of NATO,7 have issued a joint statement to \u2018temporarily pause\u2019 their participation in all meetings of the Council and its subsidiary bodies.8 These states argued that the Arctic Council works on the fundamental rules of international law, and Russia, which currently holds the chairmanship of the Arctic Council, has violated it. While describing the action as \u2018regrettable\u2019, Russia, in response, highlighted that the Arctic Council has remained depoliticised, despite the past geopolitical issues.9\n\nThe A7\u2019s decision could have serious implications for the Arctic. First, all the eight Arctic states are at close geographical proximity to one another. Even a temporary suspension of the Arctic Council could challenge its established credibility and decision making. This could enhance geopolitical competition by superseding the existing scientific cooperation, consensus on environmental concerns and other mutually agreed solidarities between the states in the region.\n\nSecond, the Arctic contains multiple existing issues of territorial sovereignty, resource exploitation and disagreements over national/international shipping routes. Suspending the working of the Arctic Council would terminate the existing cooperation, resulting in unwanted strategic competition in the region. Furthermore, in order to protect their own self-interests in the Arctic, a potential military build-up can be expected.\n\nThird, Russia holds the largest territorial and coastal extent in the Arctic. It remains the only state with strong Arctic infrastructure and military capabilities. The Russian Arctic accounts for almost half of the total Arctic population living in the region.10 If the current situation prevails or the A7 countries consider forming any new alliance or forum without Russia, it would polarise the Arctic region, which could lead to dangerous outcomes. Similarly, any such alternative approach/alliance by Russia with non-Arctic states, would further challenge the existing cooperation in the region.11\n\nFourth, the issue of climate change is serious in the Arctic, where the global warming is occurring at thrice the average normal. Suspension of all established cooperation with Russia through Arctic Council, would seriously affect academic and scientific engagements between states on climate research in the region.\n\nFifth, the Arctic Council has become successful in negotiating three important legally binding agreements in the region. These include \u2018Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation\u2019,12\u2018Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response\u2019,13 and the \u2018Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic\u2019.14 Also, all the Arctic states have successfully concluded an \u2018International Agreement on Prevention of Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean\u2019.15 As a counter measure to A7\u2019s decision on the Arctic Council, Russia may consider withdrawing from these important agreements in the Arctic, which would further lead to greater insecurities in the region.\n\nSixth, apart from the Arctic permanent states, there are 13 non-Arctic observer states in the Arctic Council.16 Though these states remain outside the decision-making process of the Council, they are actively engaged in the various working groups of the Council. Asian observers such as India, China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea face vulnerabilities as a result of climate change in the Arctic. A pause in the Working Groups of the Arctic Council will have significant implications for the ongoing and future projects undertaken by these states.\n\nFinally, the ongoing debate within the Finish and the Swedish parliaments to join NATO membership will make the revival of the Arctic Council difficult, if not impossible. As and when these two Arctic Council members join NATO, it will have significant geopolitical repercussions for the region. Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, has already warned of Russia\u2019s nuclear and hypersonic deployments, if Finland and Sweden secured NATO membership.17\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Arctic Council, till recently, has proved itself to be a successful model of cooperation. Security issues were consciously kept away from the charter of the Arctic Council. The heightened political contestations in the wake of Russia\u2013Ukraine war could radically alter the spirit as well as structure of the Council. With Finland and Sweden seeking membership of NATO, the situation in the region will, in all likelihood, aggravate further. How the Arctic Council responds to these developments and whether it will remould itself is a moot question.\n\nViews expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Manohar Parrrikar IDSA or of the Government of India.\n\n*About the author: Bipandeep Sharma is a Research Analyst at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.\n\nSource: This article was published by Manohar Parrrikar IDSA",

But Poland\u2019s government has consistently argued for tougher measures, saying that existing ones have not done enough to prevent or discourage the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cWe need crushing sanctions, much stronger than those that have been imposed so far,\u201d said Morawiecki today. \u201cOur job is to convince our partners in Western Europe to act faster and stronger for a free Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister recently directly criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for prioritising business interests over Ukrainian victims and French President Emmanuel Macron for trying to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. Macron hit back by accusing Morawiecki of interfering in the French elections on behalf of Marine Le Pen.\n\nWhile Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party initially refrained from direct criticism of Hungary \u2013 a close ally \u2013 for its lack of support for Ukraine and opposition to tougher sanctions on Russia, earlier this month PiS chairman Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski expressed his disappointment regarding Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s approach.\n\nRussia has \"committed genocide\" in Ukraine and must face severe international repercussions, says Poland's PM.

It admits that its embargo on coal may violate EU rules, but said that it \u201ccannot wait any longer\u201d for Brussels to act.\n\nPolish officials were also among the first to warn that genocide may be taking place in Ukraine. President Andrzej Duda said as early as 2 March, six days after the invasion, that Russian actions \u201cbear the hallmarks of genocide\u201d. Polish prosecutors have been helping the International Criminal Court investigate crimes against humanity.\n\nAs well placing billboards in western European cities, the new campaign will also feature conferences organised by Polish diplomats with the presence of Ukrainian ambassadors, the government revealed.\n\nMain image credit: KPRM (under CC BY 3.0 PL)",

            "text": "KYIV: Russian forces tried to storm a steel plant sheltering soldiers and civilians in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol , and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he would meet Sunday in his nation's capital with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Zelenskyy in a news conference gave few details about the logistics of his upcoming encounter with Blinken and Austin but said he expected results \u2014 \u201cnot just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons.\u201dIt would be the first high-level US trip to Kyiv since before the war began on Feb. 24.While visiting Poland in March, Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil to meet with the country's foreign minister.Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a US leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris.Russia's effort in Mariupol is aimed at crushing the last pocket of resistance in the city, a place of deep symbolic and strategic value to Moscow. Completing its capture would give Russia its biggest victory yet, after a nearly two-month siege reduced much of the city to a smoking ruin.In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces also pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine A 3-month-old baby girl was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, officials said. Zelenskyy said 18 more were wounded. The Ukrainian news agency UNIAN said the baby's mother, Valeria Glodan, and grandmother also were killed, citing social media posts from the baby's father and others.\u201cThe war started when this baby was 1 month old. Can you imagine what is happening?\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThey are just bastards. ... I don't have any other words for it, just bastards.\u201dThe Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.The command post was hit on Friday, killing two generals and critically wounding another, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency said in a statement. The Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.The fate of the Ukrainians in the sprawling and besieged seaside steel mill in Mariupol, where Russia says its forces have taken the rest of the city, wasn't immediately clear.A Ukrainian military unit on Saturday released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun.\u201cWe want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,\u201d one woman in the video said. \u201cYou have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness.\u201dRussia said it took control of several villages elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region and destroyed 11 Ukrainian military targets overnight, including three artillery warehouses. Russian attacks also struck populated areas.Associated Press journalists observed shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city; regional Gov. Oleh Sinehubov said three people were killed.In the Luhansk area of the Donbas, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six people died during the shelling of a village, Gorskoi.In Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas, the AP witnessed two soldiers arriving at a hospital, one of them mortally wounded.Sitting in a wheelchair outside her damaged Sloviansk apartment, Anna Direnskaya, 70, said, \u201cI want peace.\u201dOne of many native Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, Direnskaya said she wishes Russians would understand that Ukrainians are not bad people and that there should be no enmity between them.\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d she said. \u201cI don't know.\u201dBritish officials said Russian forces had not gained significant new ground, but Ukrainian officials announced a nationwide curfew ahead of Easter Sunday, a sign of the war's disruption and threat to the entire country.Mariupol has been a key Russian objective and has taken on outsize importance in the war.It would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014. Russia-backed separatists control parts of the Donbas.An adviser to Ukraine's presidential office, Oleksiy Arestovych, said Russian forces resumed airstrikes on the Azovstal plant and were also trying to storm it, in an apparent reversal of tactics. Two days earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin had given an order not to send troops in but instead to blockade the plant.Ukrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops along with civilians are taking refuge in its tunnels.Earlier Saturday the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the plant, released the video of around two dozen women and children. Its contents could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians trapped underground there.The video shows soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl says she and her relatives \u201chaven't seen neither the sky nor the sun\u201d since they left home Feb. 27.The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told the AP the video was shot Thursday.The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed by far-right activists in 2014 at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and has elicited criticism for some of its tactics.More than 100,000 people \u2014 down from a prewar population of about 430,000 \u2014 are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city.Yet another attempt to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol failed Saturday. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organised buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 227 kilometres to the northwest.\u201cAt 11 o'clock, at least 200 Mariupol residents gathered near the Port City shopping centre, waiting for evacuation,\u201d Andryushchenko posted on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cThe Russian military drove up to the Mariupol residents and ordered them to disperse, because now there will be shelling.\u201dAt the same time, he said, Russian buses assembled about 200 metres (yards) away.Residents who boarded those were told they were being taken to separatist-occupied territory and not allowed to disembark, Andryushchenko said. His account could not be independently verified.In the attack on Odesa, Russian troops fired at least six missiles, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister.\u201cResidents of the city heard explosions in different areas,\u201d Gerashchenko said via Telegram.\u201cResidential buildings were hit. It is already known about one victim. He burned in his car in a courtyard of one of the buildings.\u201dZelenskyy's news conference was held in a Kyiv subway station, where he paused at one point as a train noisily passed through.The subway system, which includes the world's deepest station, attracted widespread attention early in the war when hordes of people took shelter there.Regarding the expected visit Sunday by US officials, Zelenskyy said: \u201cI believe that we will be able to get agreements from the United States or part of that package on arming Ukraine which we agreed on earlier. Besides, we have strategic questions about security guarantees, which it is time to discuss in detail, because the United States will be one of those leaders of security countries for our state.\u201d",

            "text": "Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel became the frontlines of the unprovoked Russian invasion for a month as Putin\u2019s forces attempted to capture the capital city Kyiv.\n\nIrpin was the first of the trio of cities to become free from Russian occupation on March 28. The liberation of Bucha and Hostomel followed on April 1. Also on the same day, Ukrainian Armed Forces regained control over Demidov, Dymer, and Ivankov, towns that had suffered from brutal occupation since the first days of the war. Reports were gathered from numerous sources in Irpin and participants in the counterattack, to create a chronicle of events to document the history of the war and the chapter of Ukraine\u2019s struggle to maintain its independence.\n\nWhen the horror began on February 27\n\nA swarm of Russian helicopters attacked the airfield in Hostomel, home of the Antonov AN-225 airplane, at the beginning of the war. The first fierce battle took place there. On February 27, the first column of Russian armored forces entered Bucha. On the same day, the invading forces took heavy losses for the first time on Vokzalna Street, which was the main transportation route to Irpin. The enemy continued to push for Kyiv, but contrary to the predictions of Russian planners and Western military observers, Russian troops did not reach there in three days or thirty-three. Instead, the Ukrainian Army counterattacked.\n\nThe Russians were stopped on March 8\n\nOn March 8, military experts recorded the last successful attempt by Russian troops to attack on the right flank in the direction of Kyiv. They were moving from the formerly occupied village of Babyntsi in the direction of Kyiv with forces of up to five battalion-tactical groups, but they could not push beyond Bucha. From that moment on, Russian troops lost the ability to advance and began to prepare for defense.\n\nOn March 15, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appointed the head of the military administration in Kyiv region. He selected Oleksandr Pavliuk, former commander of the Ukrainian Peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. Awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine in early March, Zelenskyy appointed him to further strengthen the defense of the capital and Kyiv region.\n\nOn March 17, military experts reported that the Russians had begun digging in across the occupied territories. It was predicted that Russia would try to turn the war into one of attrition, and use its numerical advantage in artillery to destroy Kyiv and its defenders.\n\nOn March 21, the Russians were close to being able to fire not only cruise and ballistic missiles at the center of Kyiv, but also artillery. To accomplish this, however, they needed positions closer than 15 miles.\n\nThe distance was strategically important, because Russian forces had a limited supply of their expensive missiles to used against the capital\u2019s air defense network. Artillery shells, by contrast, are virtually impossible to intercept. They are very cheap and the Russians have huge reserves. It was the use of artillery that brought the greatest destruction to Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, and other cities.\n\nThe first reports of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops surfaced on March 19 and 20. On March 22, Ukrainian Armed Forces expelled the Russians from Makarov, a village near the Zhytomyr highway, and from the village of Moshchun near Pushcha-Vodytsya, along the Irpin River and northeast of the city of Irpin. The Irpin River bank became the main barrier utilized by the defenders of Kyiv.\n\nDue to the demolition of the dam near the village of Demydiv, the water of Irpin River \u2013 which was were previously pumped into the Kyiv Sea \u2013 overflowed and blocked the road for enemy vehicles north of the city of Irpin. The natural obstruction limited possible approaches to the capital to three, or would require the Russians to drive further South. All three bridges across the river on the Zhytomyr, Irpin, and Warsaw routes were blown up in the first days of the war.\n\nOn March 23, the first details of a siege by Russian forces in Bucha and Irpin were reported. Ukrainian troops pushed the Russians to Borodyanka and marched on the outskirts of the Warsaw route. It was along that route that the 40-mile armored convoy traveled, the main supply line for Russian invasion forces in Irpin and Bucha. The Ukrainian military was able to attack the stalled Russian vehicles at that section of the road, and destroy the rear of the Russian army near Kyiv.\n\nThere were actually two main roads for resupply at that time. The best was the Warsaw route from Bucha to Borodyanka and further \u2013 the road north to Ivankov, through the Chernobyl zone to Belarus. The second and more problematic was a little east, along the river Irpin and further to Demydiv, Dymer, and Ivankiv.\n\nFighting in the Russian rear in the region was also visible in satellite images. In a service provided by NASA that collects information about fires visible from space, plumes of burning smoke can be seen along the routes that Russian forces received supplies near Kyiv. The destruction was the result of Ukrainian artillery, and frequent ambushes that destroyed logistics at the Russian rear.\n\nThe military operation around Irpin-Bucha lasted for the next three days. According to military expert Tom Cooper, the Armed Forces went on the offensive, \u201cstriking in different places and at different times along the front line to disrupt the supply of Russian troops.\u201d He described the tactic as an effective way to keep Russian artillery beyond 15 miles from Kyiv, which prevented effective strikes at the city\u2019s center.\n\nOn March 26, it was reported that the Russian military had appointed Alexander Chayko of the Eastern Military District as commander of the 35th Separate Army near Chernobyl. He was expected to regroup Russian troops and lead them into battle. But on the March 28 there was an official announcement about the liberation of Irpin. On April 1, reports confirmed that the Russian army had left the Chernobyl zone.\n\nLiberating cities is harder than defending\n\nThe operation to liberate Irpin began two weeks after the destruction of the Russian rear by the Ukrainian Army. Ukraine Forces recaptured street after street in close combat.\n\nMilitary experts have described urban defense as a hell for any soldier. Defenders always have the advantage. They choose where to fight, and can hold back the dominant forces of the enemy. This tactic gave Ukrainians the advantage at the start of the invasion. However, once Russians captured an area the same tactic made it harder for Ukrainian troops to push them out. But Irpin was an example of Ukraine\u2019s determination, and set the stage for the liberation of the rest of Ukraine.\n\nA member of the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps (DUK), Danya Dansky, offered details of the operation. He participated against Russian hostilities in 2014, including the battles for Donetsk Airport. Before the war, Dansky worked in production of furniture. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, he began military training to defend his homeland. When Putin launched his unprovoked war to seize all of Ukraine, Dansky again volunteered.\n\nOn March 20, his unit arrived in Irpin with the task of liberating the city from enemy forces. At that time, the Ukrainian military controlled the central part of the city and the bridge to Bucha near the Giraffe Mall on Soborna Street, the central street that runs through the entire city and connects Kyiv to Bucha.\n\nOn the eastern and western outskirts of the city, and on both sides at the center, were Russian troops. But they failed to completely occupy the city. Russian troops were based in a triangle in the west of the city and in the northeast.\n\nOne of the final battles took place at the intersection of Hostomel Highway, Vulytsya Severynivs Road, and 10th Street. The Pchelka store at the crossroads was the main landmark.\n\nDansky commanded reconnaissance and cover for his tank unit. The task of his team was to find the enemy, assess its strength, help coordinate an armored attack, and protect the tank in battle. Despite considerable armor and firepower, tanks are vulnerable to anti-tank missiles and grenade launchers. The inability of the Russians to apply basic military tactics left much of their armor without infantry support. The result was that Ukrainian forces were highly effective in the destruction of Russian tanks.\n\nHow the liberation of Irpin took place\n\nAfter arriving in Irpin, Dansky\u2019s platoon began to advance along with a collection of other units. Each day, step by step, they moved forward until the city was completely liberated. In his eight years of fighting, Dansky said he had never encountered such intense artillery fire from the enemy.\n\n\u201cThe Russians got stuck in the buildings. They shot or burned our equipment. But the main problem was that they beat us very hard with artillery, mines, grenades, everything. \u201cIn the first 4 hours when we arrived, they fired 260 shells. We counted. Our artillery could not fire so actively at the Russians, because there were civilians everywhere. The Russian military was not worried at all about civilian casualties or destruction. We had to fight against enemy infantry and also against their armored vehicles. The enemy used tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and even light self-propelled guns in Irpin.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nThe heaviest final battles took place in the area of Hostomel Highway and the military hospital on the northern outskirts of the city. At that time the Russian occupation of Irpin was coming to an end.\n\n\u201cAt the crossroads we met enemy infantry, when they saw our tanks gathered in one place. They were about 54 yards away and started running away after we opened up on them. The Russians left behind many weapons and equipment that will now work against them. And they also left evidence of their robberies. In places where there should be infantry gear used for fighting, we found many stolen things. They were purely looters, taking things to sell back home.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nElite Russian forces in Irpin\n\nThe city was occupied by elite units of the Russian army. Soldiers of the 106th and 98th Airborne Divisions, the 76th and 31st Airborne Assault Divisions, and the Black Sea Fleet Marines were spotted there. These troops are the best trained and equipped units of the Russian army. It was their job to quickly capture the suburbs of Kyiv and storm the capital. But the Ukrainian people stopped their invasion and forced them to retreat.\n\n\u201cWe saw these so-called elite troops flee very quickly. After we came in and advanced on their positions, they immediately ran away. They did not want to die, they were afraid. We were ready to stand to the end, because this is our land,. It will be liberated. Everything will be liberated, both Crimea and Donbas.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nMurders of citizens and destruction of buildings\n\nMost Irpin residents were evacuated in late February and early March. But from the first days of spring, it became dangerous to leave the city alone, outside the humanitarian corridors. During the month of March, while the fighting continued, locals were evacuated in groups over a pedestrian crossing under the destroyed bridge to Romanivka. The efforts took place under fire and at risk of death. After the destruction of the railways, it was the only way to leave Irpin, all other areas were shelled and controlled by the enemy.\n\nBut several thousand people remained in the city during that time, in all areas including the occupied ones. For a month they lived almost without communication, without electricity, no gas, no water, and no heat. They practically did not leave their basements, because they risked their lives to go outside and look for supplies. But many did go out, and became victims of Russian war crimes. Many eyewitness accounts from surviving residents have been collected, about shootings and rapes by Russians. Ukrainian soldiers also saw evidence of those crimes when they entered the city, along with hundreds of boobytraps left behind.\n\nSome of the residents who remained in the city could not leave their sick relatives, some simply decided that it was safer to stay at home. Among them were the elderly. At the same time, the locals helped Ukrainian soldiers, and showed them the safe ways navigate around Irpin.\n\nOnly a few days after the city\u2019s liberation did local authorities and police have the opportunity to pick up and bury the dead. But it was a slow process because occupation forces had left numerous mines, particularly on bodies.\n\nMost of the houses in the city were damaged or destroyed. According to Irpin\u2019s Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, who headed the Irpin Territorial Defense and was in the city all the time helping the townspeople, the western suburbs, the Synergy district with new buildings, and the BKZ district bordering Bucha, all suffered the most damage. The new building in the area of Hostomel Highway were severely damaged from the fighting. Thousands of private estates in all parts of the city were looted and destroyed, along with schools and businesses.\n\nIrpin has started the slow process of cleaning up after war and is in the process of coming back to life. Despite all the attempts by Russian forces to wipe out the town, it remained defiant and victorious. Irpin was awarded the title of \u201cHero City\u201d for stopping the Russian advance, and for its sacrifice. All the artillery shells, rockets, and bombs that fell on Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel could fall on Kyiv.",

However, the European community which is already mobilizing cutting-edge equipment for Ukraine is unconvinced.\n\nUnder pressure, Germany had to pull the plug on the Nord Stream II pipeline but it now seems to be drawing a line.\n\nCriticism of Berlin has grown tremendously after it was revealed that German companies had used a loophole in an EU embargo on arms exports to Russia, selling \u201cdual-use\u201d equipment to Moscow for \u20ac121 million ($130.1 million), including guns and special protection vehicles.\n\nUkrainian ambassador to Germany accused Berlin of arming Russia while refusing to send military equipment to Ukraine. In 2020 alone Germany sold \u20ac366 million of dual use goods to Russia. These can be used for military purposes. German policy in the Ukraine crisis is shameful. \u2014 Alan Sked (@profsked) February 13, 2022\n\nInterestingly, Germany had earlier taken advantage of the loopholes in the EU embargo regime against China to supply MTU engines for its submarines. It was not too long ago that it clarified that it was not doing any business with China anymore, as previously observed by the EurAsian Times.\n\nBerlin justified its use of an ambiguity in the EU\u2019s 2014 arms embargo, saying that the products were only delivered after the Kremlin promised they would be used for civilian purposes rather than military ones.\n\nOn the other hand, as part of 76 export licenses, France was also determined to be liable for shipments worth \u20ac152 million ($164.4 million) to Russia. Using a loophole in the EU embargo, Paris permitted exporters to complete contracts signed before 2014.\n\nAlong with bombs, rockets, and torpedoes, French companies delivered thermal imaging cameras, as well as navigation systems for fighter aircraft, attack helicopters and Russian tanks.\n\nSince the Russian invasion began on February 24, the EU has imposed additional limitations on dual-use item exports to Moscow, effectively shutting the loophole. However, the exemption on previously agreed-upon weaponry sales to Russia was not revoked until the bloc\u2019s fifth package of sanctions.\n\nWhen it became clear that weapons were still flowing into Russia, envoys from Poland and Lithuania worked to alter the original 2014 arms embargo language earlier this month.\n\nAccording to data from the European Commission, EU members sold Russia \u20ac39 million ($35.7 million) in weaponry and ammunition last year as the Kremlin prepared for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCountries often cite the \u201cGrandfather Clause\u201d to evade the embargos set by organizations, something that France has chosen as an escape from this situation. A grandfather clause is a provision that allows an old rule to apply to some current instances while a new rule applies to all future cases.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that France goes to the second round of polling soon and these revelations might have some impact on the voting patterns across the French population.\n\nNATO Divided Over Russia?\n\nEven though NATO countries have unanimously condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Russia\u2019s use of brute force and war crimes, there is no perfect agreement among the allies on the extent of sanctions that should be imposed on Russia.\n\nSome countries like Hungary have openly stated that they would not support more sanctions on Russia that would dent its own economy.\n\nFurther, even as the US, the UK, Canada and Australia have completely banned oil purchases from Russia, several European countries have continued to buy the Russian oil which has led to an uptick in supply. However, this could be expected to be sized down in the coming days.\n\nThe fact that France and Germany chose to supply arms to Russia despite largely acknowledging the insurgency fueled by Russia in the Donbas region is telling of Moscow\u2019s role in international integration, trade and defense relationships. However, these same weapons would now be used by the Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nTobias Ellwood, the chairman of the Commons defense committee, believes that at the June NATO meeting in Madrid, all member states should announce that they will not be transferring armaments to Russia.\n\n\u201cIf we agree Russia now presents an existential threat to European security, then there is no excuse for any European country to continue supplying Russia arms,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Russian assault in the Donbas region has intensified manifold in the last few days as it prepares to seize the region from Ukraine. Even as military aid keeps pouring from some NATO states, there is a challenge for the allies to put their own house in order and ensure consensus to avoid public embarrassment and Ukraine\u2019s ire.",

Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 over 2.9 million people have entered Poland from Ukraine -- a large proportion of the over 5 million who\u2019ve left the country.\n\nUkraine Continues to Repel Russia Along Line of Contact (7:30 a.m.)\n\nRussia has made some territorial gains, likely at \u201csignificant cost\u201d to its troops, but numerous assaults along the line of contact in the Donbas this week have been repelled, the U.K. said in an intelligence update.\n\n\u201cPoor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,\u201d the U.K. said.\n\nRussia continues to attack the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, including with strikes from long-range aircraft. Satellite images in towns near Mariupol show what appear to be mass graves; city officials have estimated 10,000 or more may have died during the week\u2019s long siege.\n\nGermany to Borrow Extra 40 Billion Euros to Cushion War Blow (11:41 p.m.)\n\nGermany will increase its borrowing plans this year to cushion the effect of the war in Ukraine, taking the total for net new debt to almost 140 billion euros, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe adjustment is needed to help finance measures to offset the economic impact of the war and surging energy prices on companies and consumers, said the people. The plan will be presented to the cabinet on Wednesday, and then onto parliament for approval.\n\nZelenskiy Says Austin, Blinken Will Visit (6:40 p.m.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be discussing the list of weapons we need and the pace of their delivery to Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskiy said at a press conference in a Kyiv subway station. \u201cI will emphasize again -- the last week, the signals, the messages, the tone on weapon supplies -- everything has improved.\u201d Ukraine is waiting for the security situation to allow the U.S. president to visit, he said.\n\nThe U.S. National Security Council and the State Department did not immediately comment. The visits, if confirmed, would be the first by top American officials to Ukraine\u2019s capital since the war began.\n\nZelenskiy Says Weapons Flow May Bolster Counteroffensive (6:40 p.m.)\n\nZelenskiy also said accelerated weapon supplies from the U.S. and European nations may enable Ukraine\u2019s military to step its counteroffensive. \u201cParticularly, we see a change in the speed of response from the U.S., and if this speed increases, we\u2019ll be able to speed up de-occupation of our territory.\u201d\n\nThe president said Ukraine\u2019s military isn\u2019t in a position to relieve forces and citizens trapped in the Azovstal factory in Mariupol, which is encircled by Russian forces.\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "text": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces called in airstrikes on a besieged steel factory in the southern city of Mariupol to try to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops holding out in the strategic port, Ukrainian officials said Sunday, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would meet in Kyiv with two top American officials.Zelenskyy gave few details about the logistics of his planned talks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on what was the 60th day since Russia invaded Ukraine. But he told reporters he expected the Americans to come bringing \"not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons.\"The visit would be the first to Ukraine's capital by high-level U.S. officials since the invasion began Feb. 24. While visiting Poland in March, Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil to meet with the country's foreign minister. Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a U.S. leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris.The meeting was set to take place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter, an occasion Zelenskyy highlighted the allegorical significance of to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\"The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!\" he said, speaking Sunday from the ancient St. Sophia Cathedral.Russia has been trying to take Mariupol for nearly two months, and the city on the Sea of Azov has seen some of the war's worst deprivations. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014.Some 2,000 troops have been fighting tenaciously to hold on to the last remaining Ukrainian outpost in the city, the Azovstal steel plant, which also has civilians taking refuge in its labyrinthine tunnel system.Russian forces have continued to pummel the plant, hitting it with air strikes, including by long-range aircraft, Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesman for the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff, said Sunday.Mariupol has been blockaded for most of the war. Ukrainian officials have said they expect to find thousands of dead civilians and evidence of war crimes there when the fighting ends. Satellite images have shown what appear to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol.In the last day, Russia also pressed its attacks elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war and the Russians are aiming to gain full control over Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland.Shtupun said Russian forces intensified their assault operations toward the cities of Popasna and Siverodonetsk in Luhansk, and Kurakhiv in Donetsk. Luhansk regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that eight people were killed and two others were wounded in a Russian barrage on Saturday.The Russians also have shelled the Dnipro region west of Donbas, where at least one person was killed by a Russian missile, according to regional Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko.Russia has pulled back forces from Kyiv, and the north of the country to feed into the Donbas offensive, but the British Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week.\"Despite Russia making some territorial gains, Ukrainian resistance has been strong across all axes and inflicted significant cost on Russian forces,\" the ministry said in an intelligence update.\"Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,\" it said.In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. A 3-month-old baby was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, officials said. Zelenskyy said 18 more were wounded.\"The war started when this baby was one month old. Can you imagine what is happening?\" Zelenskyy said. \"They are just bastards. ... I don't have any other words for it, just bastards.\"The Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.The command post was hit on Friday, killing two generals and critically wounding another, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency said in a statement. The Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.If true, at least nine Russian generals have been killed since the start of the invasion, according to Ukrainian reports.On Saturday the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the Mariupol steel plant, released a video of around two dozen women and children sheltering there. Its contents could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians trapped underground there.The video shows soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl said she and her relatives had \"seen neither the sky nor the sun\" since they left home Feb. 27.The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told the AP the video was shot Thursday. The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed by far-right activists in 2014 at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and has elicited criticism for some of its tactics.More than 100,000 people - down from a prewar population of about 430,000 - are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city.Yet another attempt to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol failed Saturday. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organized buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 141 miles to the northwest.",

This hasn\u2019t been the case since the Cold War,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area\u201d in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe said.\n\nCurrently, there are about 20 Russian warships positioned around the Mediterranean, Lavernhe told the AFP news agency. Meanwhile, the United States has doubled its naval presence in the region since the start of the Ukraine war, the official said.\n\n\u201cWhere there are American forces, the Russians are there too,\u201d Lavernhe said. \u201cRussian ships are positioned to monitor the activity of allied forces.\u201d\n\nNATO operated about three aircraft carrier strike groups in the region before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

The UK has promised to send military vehicles and said it was considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw\u2019s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces are attempting to storm the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol by land, backed up by aerial and artillery bombardment, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on April 24.\n\n\u201cRussian troops are trying to finish off the defenders of Azovstal and more than 1,000 civilians who are hiding at the plant,\u201d Arestovych wrote on Facebook.

Click here for updates from April 22.\n\nRussia Destroys US and EU Weapons Delivered to Ukraine, Moscow Says\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said it used high-precision missiles on Saturday to destroy a logistics terminal in the Black Sea port city of Odesa where a large number of weapons supplied by the United States and European nations were being stored.\n\nIt also said Russian forces had killed up to 200 Ukrainian troops and destroyed more than 30 vehicles on Saturday.\n\nIn Odesa, at least eight people were killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings, and two more were destroyed on Saturday, the Ukrainian armed forces said.\n\nThe death toll could not be independently verified. The last big strike on or near Odesa was in early April.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin to Visit Kyiv and Hold Talks with Zelenskyy\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said Saturday.\n\nThe U.S. top diplomat and Pentagon chief will hold talks with Zelenskyy and discuss what kinds of weapons are to be provided to Ukraine to confront the Russian offensive, the Ukrainian leader said during a press conference.\n\nThe visit was announced after President Joe Biden add an extra $800 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nRussia Investigates Media Report on Presence of British SAS Special Forces in Ukraine\n\nRussia\u2019s top state investigative body said on Saturday it was looking into a Russian media report alleging that sabotage experts from Britain\u2019s Special Air Service (SAS) have been deployed to western Ukraine.\n\nThe SAS is an elite military force trained to conduct special operations, surveillance, and counter-terrorism. Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti news agency on Saturday quoted a Russian security source as saying about 20 SAS members had been sent to the Lviv region.\n\nIn a statement, the Investigative Committee said it would follow up on the report that they had been sent in \u201cto assist the Ukrainian special services in organizing sabotage on the territory of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe British Ministry of Defense had no immediate comment on the Russian investigation in response to a Reuters request.\n\nBritain said it sent military trainers to Ukraine earlier this year to instruct local forces in using anti-tank weapons but the British government said on Feb. 17\u2014a week before Russia\u2019s invasion\u2014that it had pulled out all troops except those needed to protect its ambassador.\n\nIt was not clear what steps the Investigative Committee planned to take in response to any SAS involvement in Ukraine. But the investigation into the possible presence of forces from a NATO country is significant, given that Russia has issued warnings to the West not to get in the way of its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine.\n\n___\n\nRussian Space Chief Warns of Possible Trigger for World War III\n\nAn attack against a spacecraft could usher in the next global war, Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia\u2019s national space agency Roscosmos, said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cOne must keep in mind that the destruction of a foreign spacecraft means World War III. It\u2019s a casus belli, and there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Rogozin said, using a Latin term for a formal legal reason to start a war.\n\nRogozin was commenting on Washington\u2019s decision to stop conducting anti-satellite missile tests. Announcing the move on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris called the destruction of satellites during such tests \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d because it leaves dangerous space debris.\n\nThe Roscosmos chief, however, argued that the United States is now \u201cpretending to be doves\u201d because it had already conducted all the necessary tests. \u201cThis move should, therefore, be strictly viewed as propaganda,\u201d he said.\n\nRogozin argued that the Boeing X-37, an unmanned U.S. shuttle-like spacecraft currently orbiting the Earth, could potentially be used for spying and carrying weapons of mass destruction. He said that a proposal by Russia and China to sign a treaty banning the placement of weapons in outer space was met with \u201cdead silence\u201d in Washington.\n\nThe stationing of weapons of mass destruction in outer space has been internationally banned since 1967.\n\n____\n\nGeneral Accuses Boris Johnson of Disclosing Military Secrets\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is \u201ctempting evil\u201d with his statements about the training of Ukrainian troops abroad amid the conflict with Russia, Polish General Waldemar Skrzypczak, who advises the defense minister, said on Friday.\n\nDuring a visit to India earlier this week, Johnson told journalists that \u201cwe are currently training Ukrainians in Poland in the use of anti-aircraft defense, and actually in the UK in the use of armored vehicles.\u201d\n\nSkrzypczak, who headed one of the multinational divisions in Iraq in the mid-2000s, told Polish newspaper Fakt that \u201cwhen we were on missions abroad it was hard to imagine that one of the politicians would talk about our plans or training on television.\u201d\n\nBy making the comments, Johnson \u201creveals military secrets\u201d to Russia, the general said. \u201cTraining is a military matter and must be kept under wraps. The man should \u2026 think before saying such things.\u201d\n\nThe former commander of Poland\u2019s land forces called the prime minister\u2019s behavior \u201cextremely irresponsible,\u201d warning that it could lead to \u201cdisastrous consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prime minister may not be aware of this, but with such statements he endangers the success of the entire military operation, as well as the safety of soldiers,\u201d Skrzypczak said.\n\n_____\n\nRussia to Deploy Sarmat Missiles by Autumn in \u2018Historic\u2019 Nuclear Upgrade\n\nRussia said on Saturday it plans to deploy its newly tested Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles by autumn.\n\nThe target stated by Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, is an ambitious one as Russia reported its first test-launch only on Wednesday and Western military experts say more will be needed before the missile can be deployed.\n\nThe Sarmat is capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads and decoys, and of striking targets thousands of miles away in the United States or Europe.\n\nThis week\u2019s test, after years of delays due to funding and technical issues, marks a show of strength by Russia at a time when the war in Ukraine has sent tensions with the United States and its allies soaring to their highest levels since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.\n\nRogozin said in an interview with Russian state TV that the missiles would be deployed with a unit in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, about 3,000 km (1,860 miles) east of Moscow.\n\nHe said they would be placed at the same sites and in the same silos as the Soviet-era Voyevoda missiles they are replacing, something that would save \u201ccolossal resources and time.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the \u201csuper-weapon\u201d was a historic event that would guarantee the security of Russia\u2019s children and grandchildren for the next 30 to 40 years, Rogozin added.\n\nWestern concern about the risk of nuclear war has increased since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 with a speech in which he pointedly referred to Moscow\u2019s nuclear forces and warned that any attempt to get in Russia\u2019s way \u201cwill lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJapan, Russia Reach Agreement on Fishing Quotas Amid Ukraine-Related Sanctions\n\nJapan and Russia have reached an agreement on Tokyo\u2019s fishing quotas for salmon and trout spawned in Russian rivers, despite Moscow\u2019s anger over the spate of economic sanctions that Tokyo imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nJapan\u2019s Fisheries Agency said Saturday that the two countries agreed on Tokyo\u2019s fishing quota of 2,050 tons of salmon and trout within its exclusive economic zone, with the agreement expected to be signed next week, Kyodo News reported.\n\nUnder the agreement, Japan will pay an annual cooperation fee of between 200 million yen ($1.56 million) and 300 million yen ($2.34 million) to Russia, depending on the eventual tonnage of the catch. A cooperation fee is paid to the country where the fish were spawned.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\nUkraine President Spoke With UK\u2019s Johnson About \u2018New Phase\u2019 of Military Aid\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson about a \u201cnew phase\u201d of military aid, including the provision of heavy weapons, the president\u2019s deputy chief of staff Andriy Sybiga said on Saturday.\n\nSpeaking on national television, Sybiga said the pair also talked about further financial support for Ukraine on the call.\n\n____\n\nZelenskyy: Allies Finally Delivering Weapons Kyiv Asked For\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday said allies were finally delivering the weapons that Kyiv had asked for, adding the arms would help save the lives of thousands of people.\n\nIn a late-night video address, Zelenskyy also said comments earlier in the day by a Russian commander about the need to link up with Moldova showed Moscow wanted to invade other countries.\n\n_____\n\nUkraine: Missile Attack Kills 5 in Odesa\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president says five people were killed in a missile attack in the Black Sea port city of Odesa.\n\nUkraine presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, provided the information Saturday.\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister earlier said Russian forces fired at least six cruise missiles at the city.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko said in a Telegram post on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were able to shoot down several missiles, but at least one landed and exploded.\n\n____\n\nUS Warns Russia of \u2018Astronomical\u2019 Nuclear Price\n\nRussia would pay an \u201castronomical\u201d price should its President Vladimir Putin order the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, said on Friday amid the ongoing Russian offensive.\n\nIn an interview for the Ukrainian outlet European Pravda, Nuland was asked to assess the possibility of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons. She responded that she could not rule out such a \u201ccatastrophic scenario\u201d as Putin \u201chas already ordered\u201d what, she alleged, were \u201cbrutal war crimes,\u201d and the world must be prepared for the worst. At the same time, Nuland stressed, the consequences of such steps would be catastrophic for Russia and for Putin personally.\n\nShe refused to provide any details about the potential response from the West, saying instead that use of nuclear weapons would take the situation to a \u201cfundamentally new level\u201d where the price will be \u201csimply astronomical.\u201d\n\nAsked by a journalist if Kyiv can rely on its Western partners\u2019 support in a worst-case scenario, Nuland reassured Ukraine that it would not be left alone. Meanwhile, the under secretary of state said, the United States would continue to provide Ukraine with military assistance. She revealed that Washington has begun supplying Kyiv with multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and would do its best to keep up with Ukraine\u2019s needs.\n\nNuland\u2019s strongly-worded warnings came just two days after the Pentagon said that at this point it does not see a need to change the country\u2019s nuclear posture. The U.S. Department of Defense spokesman\u2019s statement followed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s claims that Moscow could use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\n_____\n\nPentagon Seeking Info From US Industry on Ukraine-Ready Systems\n\nThe Pentagon is looking for new avenues for U.S. industry to accelerate production and build more capacity for proven, effective weapons that require minimal training and can be rapidly exported to Ukraine, according to a government website posting on Friday.\n\nThe Department of Defense posted a request for information on SAM.gov that had an initial response deadline of May 6 and sought information on weapons or commercial capabilities related to air defense, anti-armor, anti-personnel, coastal defense, counter battery, unmanned aerial systems, and communications like radios or satellite internet.\n\n______\n\nGermany Should Stop Sending Weapons to Ukraine: Public Figures\n\nFurther military aid to Ukraine would only lead to an uncontrollable escalation of hostilities and prolong the suffering of the people caught up in the fighting, a group of German politicians and public figures have warned Chancellor Olaf Scholz in an open letter. By providing arms to Kyiv, Germany and other NATO nations \u201chave de facto made themselves a war party,\u201d the letter published by the Berliner Zeitung on Friday has said.\n\nThe co-authors of the letter, which include the ex-vice president of the Bundestag, Antje Vollmer, and a former U.N. assistant secretary general, Hans-Christof Graf von Sponeck, have said that Ukraine has \u201cbecome the battlefield for the conflict between NATO and Russia over the security order in Europe,\u201d which is now waged \u201cat the expense of the Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\nIf the conflict is not stopped quickly, it will end up in \u201canother big war\u201d similar to Word War I, the letter warns, adding that this time nuclear weapons might be used, bringing \u201cwidespread devastation and the end of human civilization.\u201d Avoiding further destruction and escalation should be an \u201cabsolute priority,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe co-authors, who also include a former German MP, Norman Paech, as well as an ex-director of the Center for Conflict Research in Marburg, Johannes Becker, maintain that NATO\u2019s military support only delays a diplomatic solution, fueling the resistance of the Ukrainian army that \u201chas little chance of winning.\u201d Instead, steps to end the bloodshed must be taken, they argue.\n\n___\n\nRussia Reveals Crew Losses From Sunken Warship\n\nAt least one person was killed and another 27 are missing after the Moskva, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, sunk earlier this month, according to Russian state media.\n\nAnother 396 crew members were evacuated to nearby ships and sent on to Sevastopol, a city in Crimea, Russia\u2019s TASS news agency reported. The Russian government, as of Tuesday, had not previously acknowledged any casualties.\n\nThe Moskva, a guided-missile cruiser, sunk on April 14, though the cause remains disputed.\n\nUkraine says it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles, which sparked a fire that detonated stored ammunition. The Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns, and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had massive amounts of explosives aboard.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry, however, says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ammunition and the resulting explosions left the Moskva with structural damage. It says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port.\n\nPhotos and a short video clip emerged early Monday on social media showing the Moskva badly damaged and on fire in the hours before it sank. The images show the Moskva listing to one side, with black holes from possible missile puncture marks, and significant scarring just above the waterline on the port (left) side in the middle of the vessel. The Kremlin on Monday said it had seen the photos of the Moskva but that they could not verify them.\n\n_____\n\nUkraine: Russians Trying to Storm Steel Mill\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s presidential office says Russian forces are attacking a steel plant that is the last defense stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the strategic port city of Mariupol.\n\nOleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, said during a briefing on Saturday that the Russian forces have resumed airstrikes on Azovstal and were trying to storm it.\n\nArestovich\u2019s statement came two days after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the whole of Mariupol, with the exception of Azovstal, had been \u201cliberated\u201d by the Russians.\n\nPutin ordered the Russian military not to storm the plant and instead to block it off in an apparent attempt to stifle the remaining pocket of resistance there.\n\n____\n\nLviv Announces Curfew Starting Easter Night\n\nLviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy has announced a curfew starting on Orthodox Easter night.\n\nCiting \u201cnew intelligence,\u201d Kozytskyy said the curfew would run from 11 p.m. Saturday to 5 a.m. Sunday, and then every day between those hours until further notice.\n\nKozytskyy said the church leadership is in support of the decision and that all churches in the region will be postponing their Easter night services until the morning hours.\n\n____\n\nCivilian Evacuation Effort Set for Mariupol\n\nEfforts to evacuate civilians to safer areas will continue in Ukraine on Saturday, the country\u2019s officials said.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app there will be another attempt to evacuate women, children, and the elderly from the strategic port city of Mariupol, which has been besieged by Russian forces for weeks.\n\nThe Kremlin earlier this week declared that Mariupol has been \u201cliberated,\u201d with the exception of the Azovstal steel mill, the last pocket of resistance where Ukrainian troops are holed up.\n\nVereshchuk said that \u201cif everything goes according to plan,\u201d the evacuation in Mariupol will begin at midday on Saturday. Many previous attempts to evacuate civilians from the city have failed.\n\nThe governor of the eastern Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on Telegram that an evacuation train will depart Saturday from the eastern city of Pokrovsk. Residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland known as Donbas, will be able to take the train free of charge.\n\nIt will bring them to the Western city of Chop near Ukraine\u2019s border with Slovakia and Hungary, according to Haidai.\n\n_____\n\nUS Convening Talks on Ukraine\u2019s Defense Needs\n\nThe Pentagon says U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will convene a meeting next week in Germany of defense officials and military leaders from more than 20 countries to discuss Ukraine\u2019s immediate and long-term defense needs.\n\nThe Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said Friday that about 40 nations, including NATO members, were invited and that responses are still arriving for the session to be held Tuesday at Ramstein air base. He did not identify the nations that have agreed to attend but said more details will be provided in coming days.\n\nThe meeting comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a major offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe agenda will include an updated assessment of the Ukraine battlefield as well as discussion of efforts to continue a steady flow of weapons and other military aid, Kirby said. It will include consultations on Ukraine\u2019s post-war defense needs but is not expected to consider changes in the U.S. military posture in Europe, he said.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says Ukrainian Fighters \u2018Securely Blockaded\u2019 at Mariupol Steel Plant\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian fighters and foreign mercenaries had been \u201csecurely blockaded\u201d at the Azovstal steel plant where they have been holding out in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin had ordered his defense minister on Thursday to block off the vast Azovstal complex \u201cso not even a fly can get through\u201d rather than try to storm it.\n\nThe defense ministry also said Russia had hit dozens of targets in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions of Ukraine on Friday.\n\n\u201cAll remnants of the Ukrainian \u2018Azov\u2019 Nazis, together with foreign mercenaries from the United States and European countries, are securely blockaded on the territory of the Azovstal plant,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Nazis are ignoring our demands to release the women and children allegedly with them to travel freely in any direction.\u201d\n\nPutin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 with the stated aim of demilitarizing and \u201cdenazifying\u201d the country.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Says Shelling of Eastern Luhansk\u2019s Cities Intensifying\n\nAll the Ukrainian-controlled cities in the eastern region of Luhansk were being shelled by Russian forces on Saturday and the barrage was intensifying, the region\u2019s governor Serhiy Haidai said on television.\n\nHe claimed Ukrainian forces were leaving some settlements there in order to regroup, but that the move did not amount to a critical setback. Russia denies targeting civilian areas.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russian Forces Made No Major Gains in the Last 24 Hours\n\nRussian forces have made no major gains in the last 24 hours despite increased activity, as Ukrainian counterattacks continue to hinder their efforts, British military intelligence claimed on Saturday.\n\nDespite Russia\u2019s claimed conquest of the port city of Mariupol, heavy fighting continues to frustrate Moscow\u2019s attempts to capture the city, impeding their progress in the Donbas region, the Ministry of Defence claimed on Twitter.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the report.\n\n_____\n\nKyiv Accuses Moscow of \u2018Imperialism\u2019 After Russia Flags Interest in South Ukraine\n\nMoscow wants to take full control over southern Ukraine, a Russian general said on Friday, a statement Ukraine said gave the lie to Russia\u2019s previous assertions that it had no territorial ambitions.\n\nRustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district, was quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to Transnistria, a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Minnekayev\u2019s statement showed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was \u201cintended only as a beginning.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry said Russia\u2019s goal of the \u201csecond phase\u201d of the war is \u201csimply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine. Imperialism as it is.\u201d\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Jalina Porter declined specific comment on Minnekayev\u2019s statement but said Washington firmly supported Moldova\u2019s sovereignty and was \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about events on the ground. \u201cNo one should be fooled by the Kremlin\u2019s announcements,\u201d Porter said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment when asked if Russia had expanded the goals of its operation and how Moscow saw the political future of southern Ukraine.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says It Shot Down Ukrainian Fighter Jet in Kharkiv Region\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said on Saturday that its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet and destroyed three MI-8 helicopters at an airfield in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Ukraine regarding the Russian claims.\n\n_____\n\nG20 Cannot Function With Russia at the Table, Canada Claims\n\nThe Group of 20 major economies cannot effectively function as long as Russia remains a member, Canada\u2019s finance minister claimed on Friday after a week of protests against Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington.\n\nDiscord over Russia\u2019s presence at the meetings has been on display all week, with officials from the United States, Canada, Britain, and other Western countries staging walkouts three days in a row whenever Russian officials spoke.\n\nThe G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, who met in Washington on Wednesday, failed to agree on its traditional communique outlining economic policy goals as Russia blocked language condemning its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe IMF steering committee and the World Bank-IMF Development Committee also failed to issue joint statements.\n\n\u201cThe G20 can\u2019t function effectively with Russia at the table,\u201d Chrystia Freeland, Canadian minister of finance who is of Ukrainian descent, told a news conference with Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko in Washington.\n\nThe tensions have called into question the effectiveness of the G20, which includes Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, as well as China, India, Indonesia, and South Africa, which have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict.\n\nThis year\u2019s G20 host country Indonesia is still optimistic that progress can be made on a number of issues despite the tensions, Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cEven with a walk out, we all agree\u201d on the substance of work that needs to be done, Indrawati said.\n\nIndrawati said she is more focused on \u201cgrassroots\u201d technical work underlying issues such as strengthening a G20 common debt framework for poor countries, and creating a new financing mechanism for future pandemic needs, than issuing a communique at the present stage.\n\nWith other G20 finance meetings scheduled for July and October and a leaders summit in November, Indrawati said there was ample time to continue progress.\n\n\u201cIf there is no forum at all, then the world is going to be in a much worse place,\u201d with each country setting policy without regard for others.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says It Plans Full Control of Donbas and Southern Ukraine; Moldova Summons Russian Ambassador\n\nRussia plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine during the second phase of what it calls its special military operation, the deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district said on Friday, reported Russian news agencies.\n\nThe Interfax and TASS news agencies cited him as saying that full control of southern Ukraine would improve Russian access to Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transdniestria, which borders Ukraine.\n\n\u201cControl over the south of Ukraine is another way to Transdniestria, where there is also evidence that the Russian-speaking population is being oppressed,\u201d TASS quoted Minnekayev as saying at a meeting in Russia\u2019s central Sverdlovsk region.\n\nMoldova\u2019s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian ambassador to express \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the remarks.\n\n\u201cThese statements are unfounded and contradict the position of the Russian Federation supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of Moldova,\u201d it said on its website.\n\n\u201cDuring the meeting, it was reiterated that the republic of Moldova \u2026 is a neutral state and this principle must be respected by all international actors, including the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\n____\n\nUkraine: Russian Offensive Continues in East\n\nThe Ukraine military\u2019s general staff says that Russian forces continue their \u201coffensive operations\u201d in eastern Ukraine with the goal of defeating Ukrainian forces, establishing full control over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and securing \u201ca land route between these territories and the occupied Crimea.\u201d\n\nUkrainian forces in the past 24 hours repelled eight Russian attacks in the two regions, destroying nine tanks, 18 armored units and 13 vehicles, a tanker, and three artillery systems, the general staff said on its Facebook page on Saturday morning.\n\nRussian forces continue to partially block and shell Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, and are active in the area of Izyum, the update said.\n\nIn the strategic port city of Mariupol, Russian troops \u201ccontinue to blockade\u201d Ukrainian units in the area of the Azovstal steelworks, the last remaining stronghold, and \u201claunch air strikes on the city, including with the use of long-range aircraft,\u201d the post said, adding that an engineering unit arrived in Mariupol in order to demine the port infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nUN Chief to Meet Putin and Zelenskyy Next Week\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will visit Moscow next week to meet Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin and then head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nGuterres will head to Moscow on Tuesday and meet Putin as well as having a working meeting and lunch with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Eri Kaneko, Guterres\u2019 associate spokesperson, told a news briefing in New York on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe hopes to talk about what can be done to bring peace to Ukraine urgently,\u201d Kaneko said.\n\nHe will meet with Zelenskyy on Thursday, foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and staff at UN agencies to discuss the scaling up of humanitarian assistance efforts, the U.N. spokesperson\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nAldgra Fredly, Allen Zhong, CNN, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Over the past eight weeks, Ukrainians have shown incredible resilience against the Russian invasion. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, over 21,000 Russian soldiers have died since the start of the invasion (Western officials estimate the figure is closer to 15,000). Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have died, and the United States believes that 2,000 to 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers have perished in the war. This is in addition to the 14,000 ethnic Ukrainians and Russians who perished after the first Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Simply put, the war has been catastrophic.\n\nDespite these tremendous losses, the Ukrainians have stood their ground. Ukrainian forces have destroyed thousands of Russian tanks, aircraft, helicopters, and armored vehicles. They also sank the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Simply put, the Ukrainians have stalled Russian advances in the country. Except for Kherson, a city located just north of the Crimean peninsula, the Ukrainians have yet to lose a metropolitan center to the Russians.\n\nBut how long can the Ukrainians hold out?\n\nWhile the international community continues to aid Ukraine, the Ukrainians desperately need military assistance. The Ukrainian army and its volunteer battalions need bulletproof vests, helmets, boots, and ammunition. The country has also called for medical assistance so that hospitals can tend to injured combatants and civilians. Finally, Ukraine is in urgent need of funding; the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine have already surpassed $100 billion. A food crisis is also possible.\n\nGiven the devastation caused by the war, Ukraine\u2019s borders must remain open. Numerous forms of humanitarian, medical, and military aid have arrived in Ukraine by way of Poland. Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, has become a major hub for this effort.\n\nIf the international community continues to provide aid to Ukraine, then the Ukrainians can win the war. According to reports, Russia executed its invasion incredibly poorly, with casualties now mounting and much of its equipment destroyed. The losses are leading to a major decline in Russian morale.\n\nMeanwhile, half a million Ukrainians have returned to Ukraine to protect their homeland, and countless foreign fighters have traveled to Ukraine to help defend the country. Overall, Ukrainian morale is high. The Ukrainian military\u2019s persistence could force the Russians from the country, reminiscent of the Finns defeating the Soviets in the 1939-1940 war. Ukraine\u2019s resilience, economic sanctions, and the continued loss of Russian life could be enough to stop the Russian invasion.\n\nThe Russian incursion is also behind schedule. According to reports provided by the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, the Russian General Staff is dissatisfied with the progress of the invasion. Russian officials assumed they would capture Kyiv within four days, and the country within fifteen. Neither occurred.\n\nGiven the failed conquest in northern Ukraine and Russia\u2019s inability to penetrate Ukrainian forces near Kyiv, the Russians have now resorted to a two-front war. In the south, Russian forces are moving through the Crimean peninsula. They established naval superiority, captured the city of Kherson, and launched an offensive in Mariupol. In the east, the Russians entered the country through the controlled territories in Luhansk and Donetsk. The Russians have attempted to capture the major cities in the east, such as Kharkiv and Kramatorsk, but Ukrainian forces have kept them at bay. As a result, the Russians have resorted to shelling these cities, leading to the deaths of thousands of civilians.\n\nWhile Ukraine has stood its ground, new problems could emerge. The Russians have now recruited volunteers from Chechnya and Syria, and Russian president Vladimir Putin is also trying to coerce Belarusian president Alyaksandr Lukashenko to join the fight. Belarusian involvement could be catastrophic for Ukraine, as the distance from the Belarusian-Ukrainian border to Kyiv is only 140 miles. If the Belarusians were to invade northern Ukraine, this could turn the tide in Russia\u2019s favor. The Ukrainians have done well in holding the Russians at bay, but fighting against two armies would be an incredible challenge.\n\nIf Belarusian forces were to enter the war, they could try to disrupt the humanitarian corridor in western Ukraine. Belarusian forces would look to position themselves near the Polish-Ukrainian border. This would stretch the Ukrainian military and its volunteer battalions by forcing them to fight on another front. A new front for Ukraine would allow the Russians to make further advances in southern and eastern Ukraine. Understanding that the corridor with Poland is essential to Ukraine\u2019s survival, Ukrainian forces would need to combat the Belarusians so that the Ukrainians could receive humanitarian, medical, and defense aid from the international community. In other words, if the Belarusians establish a presence near the Polish-Ukrainian border, this would cut off aid to Ukraine.\n\nTherefore, the corridor to Ukraine must remain open, and the international community should continue to arm Ukraine. If Syrian and Chechen mercenaries join the fight, and if the Belarusians cut off the international community\u2019s supply chain to western Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s chances of winning the war will be significantly diminished. However, swiftly providing Ukraine with the lethal and nonlethal aid it needs will help it win the war. Time is of the essence.\n\nMark Temnycky is an accredited freelance journalist covering Eastern Europe and a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nImage: Reuters",

It said Russia had \"acknowledged that the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, Russia's Central Military District said it planned to seize Ukraine's south as part of the \"second phase\" of its military operation.\n\nOver 369,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Germany\n\nAt least 369,000 people fleeing the war have registered in Germany since Russia invaded on February 24, Germany's Interior Ministry said on Friday.\n\nThe precise number to register is 369,381, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed, adding that the actual number is probably much higher.\n\nUN says humanitarian law 'tossed aside,' documents 50 civilians killed in Bucha\n\nThe United Nations said Friday that 50 civilians had been killed in Bucha, some of whom by summary execution.\n\nA UN mission to the Kyiv suburb documented the killings.\n\n\"During a mission to Bucha on the ninth of April, UN human rights officers documented the unlawful killing including by summary execution of some 50 civilians there,\" said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for Michelle Bachelet, UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nBachelet, meanwhile, said on Friday that since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 \"international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored but seemingly tossed aside.\"\n\nThe UN says, in total, it has received more than 300 allegations of civilians being killed in the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, all under the control of Russian armed forces in late February and early March.\n\nAccording to the Geneva Convention, the killing of persons \"taking no active part in hostilities\" constitutes a war crime.\n\nWatch video 00:36 UN official in Ukraine: 'Mariupol is an unfolding tragedy.'\n\nAustralia adds Putin daughters to sanctions lists\n\nAustralia has imposed sanctions and travel bans on two daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has also been targeted, the Australian government said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe statement did not name the two relations of Putin but the president is known to have two adult daughters, Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova.\n\nThe fresh round of sanctions also targets 144 Russian senators.\n\nForeign Minister Marisa Payne added that Canberra will continue to increase the pressure on Moscow by targeting those who bear responsibility for the \"unjustified and unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.\"\n\nWatch video 02:19 Ukrainians' day-to-day lives of suffering\n\nRussian military aims for 'full control' of southern Ukraine, route to Trans-Dniester\n\nMoscow is planning to seize Ukraine's south and open a route to Moldova's Trans-Dniester region, as part of the \"second phase\" of its military operation, Russia's Central Military District (CFD) command said.\n\nIn a statement carried by TASS and Interfax, Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of the CFD, said Russia plans to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine, allowing it access to Trans-Dniester.\n\n\"Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Trans-Dniester,\" Minnekayev said. He then claimed there was evidence of \"oppression\" of the Russian-speaking population there.\n\nRussia had previously used claims of oppression of Russian minorities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine as grounds for military action.\n\nA pro-Russian regime has de facto ruled the breakaway republic of Trans-Dniester since the 1990s, with support from Russian troops.\n\nKyiv has previously warned that Russia may use the region to launch attacks into western Ukraine, potentially surrounding Ukrainian forces in the south of the country, especially around the Odesa region.\n\nMariupol mayor pleads for evacuations but top official says routes too dangerous\n\nThe mayor of Mariupol has pleaded for the \"full evacuation\" of the southern city, but Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said there \"will be no humanitarian corridors\" in the country on Friday.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said \"about 100,000 people remain\" in the city, which President Vladimir Putin says is now controlled by Russian forces, a claim Ukraine denies.\n\nHowever, Deputy PM Vereshchuk said it would be too dangerous for civilians to leave on Friday.\n\n\"Because of the insecurity along the routes, there will be no humanitarian corridors today, April 22,\" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nWatch video 03:40 Russia claims victory in Mariupol\n\nUK: Russia wants to free up troops by not storming Mariupol steel plant\n\nIn an intelligence update on the Ukraine conflict, the UK suggested \"Putin's decision to blockade the Azovstal steel plant likely indicates a desire to contain Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol and free up Russian forces to be deployed elsewhere in eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin previously said it was unnecessary to storm the industrial zone containing the plant.\n\n\"A full ground assault by Russia on the plant would likely incur significant Russian casualties, further decreasing their overall combat effectiveness,\" the UK Ministry of Defense posted on Twitter.\n\nThe statement also said that despite Russia's \"renewed focus they are still suffering from losses sustained earlier in the conflict. In order to try and reconstitute their depleted forces, they have resorted to transiting inoperable equipment back to Russia for repair.\"\n\nHeavy shelling is continuing in the Donbas region as Russia seeks to advance towards settlements, including Krasnyy Lyman, Buhayikva, Barvinkove, Lyman and Popasna, the ministry said in its regular bulletin.\n\nZelenskyy: Russia planning independence 'referendum' in Ukraine's south\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of planning to \"falsify\" a \"referendum\" in parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions that are under Russian control. The regions are located to the north of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nZelenskyy urged residents in these areas not to provide their passport numbers or other personal information to Russian forces.\n\n\"This is not to help you ... This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nMoscow has either orchestrated or supported several similar votes in contested areas of Ukraine in recent years, holding a referendum in Crimea after occupying the territory in 2014 and later supporting independence votes held by pro-Russian separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nLuhansk and Donetsk later declared themselves independent \"people's republics,\" a status soon supported by Russia. The two regions are officially recognized as Ukrainian territory by almost every country in the world, despite being under control of the separatists since 2014.\n\n\"Any 'Kherson People's Republics' are not going to fly,\" Zelenskyy said, alluding to the entities established by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\n\"If someone wants a new annexation, it can only lead to new powerful sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nWatch video 26:00 Can the West ever deal again with Putin?\n\nUkraine's Zelenskyy: Mariupol 'continues to resist'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Mariupol \"continues to resist\" despite Moscow's claim to have captured it.\n\n\"In the south and east of our country, the occupiers continue to do everything to have a reason to talk about at least some victories,\" he said in a video address.\n\n\"They can only delay the inevitable \u2014 the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory, in particular Mariupol, a city that continues to resist Russia, despite everything the occupiers say.\"\n\nUN refugee agency: Situation around the world worsening amid Ukraine war\n\nThe UN High Commission for Refugees (UNCHR) said on Friday that the situation of refugees has further worsened due to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"The conflict has further worsened the situation of many of the approximately 84 million displaced people on earth, as food has already become scarcer and significantly more expensive worldwide,\" the acting UNHCR office manager in Germany, Roland Bank, said in remarks published by Germany's Funke Media Group.\n\nBank added that millions of people had already lost their incomes due to the pandemic. Soaring food and fuel prices pose new challenges for humanitarian groups, Bank said.\n\nWatch video 03:35 An estimated 20.000 have died in Mariupol over the last few weeks: DW's Mathias B\u00f6linger\n\nGermany to provide \u20ac37 million to Ukraine\n\nGerman Development Minister Svenja Shulze on Friday told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper that Berlin would allocate funds for reconstruction in Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine urgently needs housing for millions of internally displaced people and it needs an intact power grid. This is where German development cooperation can help in the short term,\" Shulze told Augsburger Allgemeine. \"My ministry has reallocated funds for this via an emergency program.\"\n\nGermany will provide \u20ac37 million (\u20ac40.1 million) for reconstruction in Ukraine, the paper went on to say citing ministry sources.\n\nAround \u20ac22.5 million would go to the reconstruction of Ukraine's power grid, while the remainder would go to the rebuilding of apartments as well as for the acquisition of medical equipment.\n\nWatch video 03:50 US public broadly supports military help for Ukraine: DW's Sumi Somaskanda\n\nZelenskyy: Russia turned down Easter truce offer\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia rejected a proposal for a cease-fire over the Orthodox Christian Easter period.\n\n\"This very well demonstrates how the leaders of this state actually treat the Christian faith, one of the most joyful and important holidays,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"But we keep the hope. Hope for peace, hope that life beats death,\" he added.\n\nZelenskyy's remarks came after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had appealed for a cease-fire during Easter.\n\nUkraine's Orthodox majority celebrate the holiday this weekend, with the Easter service starting late on Saturday into Sunday morning. Eastern Orthodoxy is also Russia's largest religious denomination.\n\nRussia takes 42 villages in Donetsk region \u2014 Ukrainian presidential aid\n\nUkrainian presidential aid Olena Symonenko said that Russian forces had captured 42 villages in the eastern Donetsk region on Thursday, as Moscow continues to gain ground in Ukraine's east.\n\nSymonenko said that Ukrainian forces could retake the villages on Friday.\n\nThe statements follows Russia's announcement that it had defeated the Ukrainian forces in Mariupol, also located in the Donetsk region, albeit without clearing out the last holdouts at a steelworks in the city.\n\nSummary of Thursday's events in Russia-Ukraine crisis\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin claimed that the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which holds a significant strategic value to Russia, had been \"liberated\" after nearly two months of siege.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials disputed Moscow's claim that Russia was in control of the city.\n\nHundreds of fighters and civilians were believed to still be inside a huge steel plant in Mariupol, which Putin ordered his forces to blockade \"so that not even a fly\" could escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington said it saw \"no evidence\" that Russia was in control of Mariupol, and announced another $800 million (around \u20ac738 million) in military aid for Ukraine, including heavy artillery.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated calls for Western governments to send more heavy weapons to Ukraine in a plea to Portuguese lawmakers.\n\nIn a separate address, Zelenskyy told a World Bank forum that Ukraine needs $7 billion a month to function amid the devastating \"economic losses\" caused by the Russian invasion.\n\nWorld Bank chief David Malpass estimated physical damage to Ukraine's buildings and infrastructure had reached roughly $60 billion, saying the figure would rise further as the war continues.\n\nYou can revisit our April 21 live updates here.\n\nWatch video 00:18 US President Biden steps up military support for Ukraine\n\njsi,sdi,fb/wmr (AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters)",

It is sad that in these days that are the holiest and most solemn for all Christians, the deadly clamor of arms is louder than the sound of bells announcing the Resurrection.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Switzerland has rejected two requests by Germany to export Swiss ammunition to Ukraine, citing the Alpine nation\u2019s strict neutrality.\n\nThe decision was first reported Sunday by Swiss weekly Sonntagszeitung.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs confirmed that \u201cboth requests from Germany, whether the ammunition received from Switzerland can be passed on to Ukraine, were answered negatively with a reference to Swiss neutrality.\u201d\n\nGermany needs Switzerland\u2019s consent for the arms delivery as part of the original sale contract.

He also challenged Russia to conduct a round of talks to negotiate an exit for the Ukrainian defenders of the plant.\n\nPodolyak tweeted that the Russian military is attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery barrage and is accumulating forces and equipment for an assault.\n\nSviatoslav Palamar, an officer with the Azov Regiment defending the plant, said in a video that on Eastern Sunday the Russians are continuing to shower the plant with bombs and shell it with heavy artillery.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military says Russian forces have continued to press their attacks in the east.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Sunday that the Russians fired on Ukrainian positions along the entire line of contact on the war\u2019s 60th day. It also said the Russian military intensified its offensive and assault operations in the Siverodonetsk, Kurakhiv and Popasna directions.\n\nA regional official in eastern Ukraine says at least eight people have been killed by the Russian shelling.\n\nLuhansk regional Governor Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that two others were wounded by the Russian barrage in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe General Staff added that Russian forces have also continued to pummel the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, hitting it with air strikes, including by long-range aircraft.\n\nThe shelling comes as the Russians are pressing their offensive in a bid to gain full control over Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland called Donbas.\n\nThe Russians have also shelled the Dnipro region west of Donbas, where at least one person was killed by a Russian missile, according to Dnipro regional Governor Valentyn Reznichenko.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian military intelligence agency posted a statement saying the command post was hit on Friday and two generals were killed and one was critically wounded.\n\nOleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in an online interview that 50 senior Russian officers were in the command center when it came under attack.

He said Ukraine has intercepted Russian conversations about \u201chow they are concealing the traces of their crimes.\u201d Satellite images have shown what appear to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nZelenskyy said the Russians set up \u201cfiltration camps\u201d near Mariupol for those trying to leave the city, which has largely been reduced to rubble. He said those who survive these camps are sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East. Many of them, he said, are children.\n\nHe said he spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday about the situation in Mariupol and the general course of the war.\n\nZelenskyy promised to find and punish those responsible for the missile attack on Odesa, which he said killed eight people and wounded 18.\n\nZelenskyy urged Ukrainians to observe a curfew and not attend Orthodox Easter services overnight. The lengthy services traditionally begin late Saturday and run through Sunday morning. \u201cBut starting from 5 a.m. you may go to the church in your city, town or community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSLOVIANSK, Ukraine \u2014 The sound of outgoing artillery and air raid sirens were heard Saturday in Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas that had come under Russian attack the day before.\n\nTwo servicemen were brought to a hospital from a nearby town, but one of them was mortally wounded and could not be saved.\n\nThe Russian strike early Friday had damaged several buildings, including a school.\n\nThe war has brought back painful memories for residents of Sloviansk, where in 2014 Ukrainian government forces repulsed Russia-backed separatists after a fierce battle. In the years since, the separatists maintained control over part of the Donbas, and Moscow has now set out to capture the entire region.\n\nAnna Direnskaya, 70, said she and her son and daughter-in-law decided to remain in Sloviansk.\n\n\u201cI lived through 2014. I was also here. I didn\u2019t go anywhere and I don\u2019t want to go anywhere. I am not hiding from myself,\u201d she said while sitting in a wheelchair outside her damaged apartment building. \u201cI want peace.\u201d\n\nDirenskaya, who like many in eastern Ukraine is a native Russian speaker, said she wishes the Russians would understand that Ukrainians are not bad people and there is no enmity between them.\n\n\u201cWhy did this happen? Why is this happening? I don\u2019t know. Tell everyone I want peace and quiet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s president says he will meet Sunday in Kyiv with the U.S. secretary of state and secretary of defense.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke of the plans Saturday during a press conference. He did not immediately share more detail about the visit from Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Saturday. The U.S. State Department also declined comment.\n\nZelenskyy has for weeks urged Western allies to send Ukraine more weapons to counter the Russian invasion.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland and Ukraine have signed an agreement increasing cooperation in the railway transport sector, aiming to help Ukraine maintain its trade exchange with foreign countries as the Russian invasion affects its ports.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Poland\u2019s premier, Mateusz Morawiecki, met on Saturday in Krakow, Poland.\n\nMorawiecki said on Facebook that they both agreed that current sanctions on Russia are insufficient, which can be seen by the condition of the \u201cRussian currency, bonds or inflation.\u201d They appealed to the international community for tougher steps that would stop Russia\u2019s aggression on Ukraine and for more military aid to help Ukraine.\n\nMorawiecki drew special attention to the plight of civilians seeking protection in a steel plant in Mariupol, as he called for the assistance.\n\n\u201cIn Mariupol soldiers \u2013 or rather Russian criminals want to make women and children starve to death. They are waiting until they run out of water. What kind of strategy is that? This is not war. This is genocide.\u201d\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9",

            "text": "Sergey Karaganov has served as a presidential advisor in the Kremlin both under Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin. He is still considered close to Russia\u2019s president and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. His recent proposals on Russian-speaking minorities in the \u201cnear abroad\u201d are known as \u201cPutin doctrine\u201d and Professor Karaganov, who is honorary chair of the Moscow think tank the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy, was first to come out publicly about an all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2019. President Putin has mentioned on Feb. 24 that Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO warrants Russia\u2019s military intervention to prevent it. However, Ukraine didn\u2019t even have a Membership Action Plan for NATO and Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz clearly stated accession was many, many years off.\n\n\n\nHow can an attack be justified on such grounds?\n\n\u00abFor 25 years people like myself have said that NATO expansion would lead to war. Putin said several times that if it came to Ukraine becoming a member of NATO, there would be no Ukraine anymore. In Bucharest in 2008 there was a plan of quick accession of Ukraine and Georgia to NATO. It was blocked by the efforts of Germany and France, but since that time Ukraine has been integrated into NATO. It was pumped up by weaponry and its troops were trained by NATO, their army getting stronger and stronger day by day. In addition we saw a very rapid increase of neo-Nazi sentiment especially among the military, the society and the ruling elite. It was clear that Ukraine had become something like Germany around 1936-1937. The war was inevitable, they were a spearhead of NATO. We made the very hard decision to strike first, before the threat becomes deadlier\u00bb.\n\nBut Ukraine was not about to become a member of NATO, not for at least many, many years. There was time to negotiate.\n\n\u00abWe have heard all kinds of promises by Western leaders throughout these 30 years. But they lied to us or they forgot about their promises. We were told at the beginning that NATO would not expand\u00bb.\n\nHow can you think a non-nuclear medium-sized country like Ukraine would ever attack a nuclear giant like Russia? And how can you think this is a Nazi country with a Jewish president elected with over 70% of the votes?\n\n\u00abUkraine was being built by the US and other NATO countries as a spearhead, maybe of aggression or at least of military pressure, to bring NATO\u2019s military machine closer to the heart of Russia. We can see now how well their forces had been preparing for a war. And Nazis were not only about killing jews. Nazism is about supremacy of one nation over another. Nazism is humiliation of other nations. The regime and the society in Ukraine were going very much like Germany in the 1930s\u00bb.\n\nYou say that NATO promised never to enlarge to the East and Russia was cheated on that. But former Warsaw Pact countries requested to be included in NATO themselves. And Russia signed up to the Founding Act on Russia-NATO relations in 1997, accepting NATO enlargement. No cheating there.\n\n\u00abIt was the biggest mistake of Russia\u2019s foreign policy in the last 30 years. I fought against it, because the Founding Act of 1997 legitimized further NATO expansion. But we signed it because we were desperately poor and we still were trusting in the wisdom of our partners. President Yeltsin probably thought that we would sneak between drops of rain, to no avail. As for NATO, it was formed as a defensive alliance. But when the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia was weak, I was shocked when I saw the rape of Serbia in 1999. Then we had an absolutely atrocious war in Iraq waged by most of the NATO members and then we had another clear-cut aggression in Libya, always by NATO. So we do not trust words. But we know that article 5 of NATO, stating that an attack on a NATO member is an attack to all, doesn\u2019t work. There is no automatic guarantee that NATO would come to the defense of a member under attack. Please read article 5 of the Treaty. But this enlargement is an enlargement of the aggressive alliance. It\u2019s cancer and we wanted to stop this metastasis. We have to do it by a surgical operation. I regret we were unable to prevent such an outcome\u00bb.\n\nWe all agree the Iraq war was illegitimate and was a very serious mistake. Corriere della Sera came out against that war at the time. But one grave mistake doesn\u2019t justify a second grave mistake. And the US people could elect a new leader, Obama, that was against the Iraq war and changed American policy. Can Russians have an opportunity to do the same?\n\n\u00abI don\u2019t think that in the foreseeable future we will have any change of power in Russia, because we are fighting a war of survival. This is a war with the West and people are regrouping around their leader. This is an authoritarian country and the leadership is always very attentive to the moods of the people. But I don\u2019t see real signs of opposition. Also, in the US or else nobody was really punished for the war in Iraq, so we have our doubts about the effectiveness of democracy\u00bb.\n\nYour parallels don\u2019t seem to match. In Libya, Ghaddafi was bombing protest demonstrations from the sky. NATO enforced a no-fly zone that had been called for by a UN Security Council resolution and Russia did not veto it.\n\n\u00abYes. At that time we believed the reassurances of our Western partners. But then we saw a clear-cut aggression devastating the country. That led us toward total distrust of Western countries, and especially of NATO\u00bb.\n\nAs for the intervention in Yugoslavia in 1999, it was made to stop a war that led to over 10,000 deaths and a UN tribunal charged Milosevic for war crimes, deportation and crimes against humanity.\n\n\u00abThe massive killings in former Yugoslavia happened after the NATO\u2019s rape of Serbia. People were killed on all sides. It was a civil war. It was an unspeakable aggression. And the Milosevic trial was a sad and humiliating show by petty people trying to rationalize their previous mistakes if not crimes\u00bb.\n\n\n\nIt was a UN tribunal, not a EU tribunal.\u00abWe don\u2019t acknowledge the right of that tribunal\u00bb.\n\nYou said that the real war now is against Western expansion. What do you mean?\n\n\u00abWe saw Western expansion happening, we see Russophobia in the West reaching levels like antisemitism between the world wars. So war was already becoming likely. And we saw deep pisions and structural problems within Western societies, so we believed that anyway a war was more and more likely. So the Kremlin decided to strike first. Also, this military operation will be used to restructure Russian elite and Russian society. It will become a more militant-based and national-based society, pushing out non-patriotic elements from the elite\u00bb.\n\nThe bottom line question is: Mussolini did not recognize the international order that emerged from the Versailles Treaty in 1919. Does the Kremlin recognize the legitimacy of the European order that emerged from the fall of the Berlin Wall? Do you think this order is legitimate?\u00abWe should not recognize the order that was built against Russia. We tried to integrate in it but we saw it was a Versailles system number 2. I wrote that we had to destroy it. Not by force, but through constructive destruction, through refusal to participate in it. But after the last demand to stop NATO was again rejected, it was decided to use force\u00bb.\n\nSo the overall goal of this war is to overturn the presence of NATO in central and eastern European countries?\n\n\u00abWe see that most of the institutions are, in our view, one-sided and illegitimate. They are threatening Russia and Eastern Europe. We wanted fair peace, but the greed and stupidity of the Americans and the short-sightedness of the Europeans revealed they didn\u2019t want that. We have to correct their mistakes\u00bb.\n\nIs the EU part of the institutions that Russia feels are illegitimate?\n\n\u00abNo, it\u2019s legitimate. But sometimes we dislike EU policies, especially if they become more and more belligerent\u00bb.\n\n\n\nYou seem to believe that an escalation of this war to other countries is inevitable. Is that what you are saying?\n\n\u00abUnfortunately it is becoming more and more likely. Americans and their NATO partners continue support of Ukraine by sending arms. If that continues, it is obvious that targets in Europe could or will be hit in order to stop lines of communications. Then the war could escalate. At this juncture it is becoming more and more plausible. I think the Joint chiefs of staff of US armed forces are of the same opinion as I am\u00bb.\n\nDenazification is what Ukraine seems to have proven by electing a Jewish president. Demilitarization is the opposite of what Mr. Putin has achieved, as this attack led Ukraine to get heavy weaponry from the West. Plus, Germany and the EU are rearming too, NATO has moved troops closer to Russia\u2019s borders, Western sanctions are now much tighter, while Europe and the US got closer together and Russia is becoming financially isolated. Would you say Putin\u2019s military operation is proving a success, so far?\n\n\u00abNazism is not only about antisemitism. It is about hating and suppressing all other nationalities. And it was taking over Ukraine. We never know how the military operations end. Demilitarization means destruction of Ukrainian military forces \u2013 that is happening and will accelerate. Of course, if Ukraine is supported with new weapons, that could prolong the agony. We can only talk about \u201cvictory\u201d in quotes, because there are many casualties on both the Russian and the Ukrainian side. The war will be victorious, in one way or another. I assume demilitarization will be achieved and there will be denazification, too. Like we did in Germany and in Chechnya. Ukrainians will become much more peaceful and friendly to us\u00bb.\n\nBut so far the Russian military had to withdraw after keeping Kiev under siege for one month. It doesn\u2019t look like the military operation is going so well, does it?\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s a large military operation, so it has secrets in the way it\u2019s waged. What if the Kiev operation was meant to distract Ukrainian forces and keep them away from the main theater in the South and South-East? Maybe that was the plan. Moreover Russian troops have been very careful not to hit civilian targets, we used only 30-35% of the lethal weapons that we could use. If we had used everything, that would have meant the destruction of Ukrainian cities and a much quicker victory. We did not do carpet bombing like Americans in Iraq. The endgame probably will be a new treaty, maybe with Zelensky still there. Probably it would mean the creation of a country in South and South-East Ukraine that is friendly to Russia. Maybe there will be several Ukraines. But at this juncture it is impossible to predict because, of course, it\u2019s an open-ended story. We are in the fog of war\u00bb.\n\n\n\nThere is clear evidence that civilians have been targeted and killed by the Russian in Mariupol, in Bucha and elsewhere. These look very much like war crimes and crimes against humanity and they were deliberate. Should they be persecuted?\n\n\u00abThe Bucha story is completely fake-staged, it\u2019s a provocation\u00bb.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look staged at all.\n\n\u00abI watched the pictures and I am 99% sure. But more in general there is a war and civilians suffer. We know that Ukrainian neoNazi forces have been using civilians as living shields, especially in Mariupol. We have different pictures with you\u00bb.\n\nIt\u2019s rather the opposite: the Russian army did not allow humanitarian corridors.\n\n\u00abWe opened them. They were blocked by nationalist forces. I know how our military operates but, of course, this is a war. We face a tragedy\u00bb.\n\nDid you expect this level of cohesion between Europe and the US?\n\n\u00abWell, the cohesion will collapse because of the problems of the West. But for the time being they were organizing even before this conflict. The West is failing and losing its position in the world, so it needs an enemy \u2013 for the moment we are the enemy. I don\u2019t think the unity will last, Europe will not commit the suicide by choosing to lose its independence. I hope our European neighbors will recuperate from this dizziness of hatred\u00bb.\n\nYou speak like some other country started this war, in fact Russia started it.\n\n\u00abI was not for this particular scenario, but it happened. And I support my country. The West committed several aggressions. We are now on the same moral level, we are equal, we are doing more or less like you. I regret that we lost our moral superiority. But we are fighting an existential war\u00bb.\n\nSanctions are getting tighter. Will Russia become more dependent on China?\n\n\u00abThere is no question about that: we will be more integrated and more dependent on China. It has positive elements but overall we will be much more dependent. I am not very much afraid of becoming a pawn of China like some EU states became pawns of the US. First, Russians have a core gene of sovereignty. Second, we are culturally different from the Chinese, I don\u2019t think that China could or would like to overtake us. However we are not happy with the situation, because I would have preferred to have better relations with Europe. But Chinese are our close allies and friends and the biggest source of Russian strength after Russian people themselves. We are a source of their strength. I would prefer to end this confrontation with Europe. My calculation was to create a safe Western flank to compete more effectively In the Asian world of tomorrow\u00bb.\n\nYou declared that China, not Russia, will emerge as the victor in this war. What did you mean?\n\n\u00abWe will be victorious because Russians always are in the end. But in the meantime we will lose a lot. We will lose people. We will lose financial resources and we will become poorer for the time being. But we are ready to sacrifice in order to build a more viable and fair international system. We are talking about Ukraine, but we really want to build a different international system than the one that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union and, in turn, is now collapsing. We all are sinking into chaos now. We would like to build Fortress Russia to defend ourselves from this chaos, even if we are getting poorer for this. Unfortunately the chaos could take over Europe, if Europe doesn\u2019t act according to its interests. What Europe is doing right now is absolutely suicidal\u00bb.\n\nIs that a threat? Don\u2019t you think nuclear deterrence still applies?\n\n\u00abI know that officially under certain circumstances the US could use nuclear weapons for the defense of Europe and they allegedly could fight for the defense of Europe against a nuclear superpower. There is a 1% chance this might happen, so we have to be careful. But if a n American president takes such a decision inviting devastating response it would mean he is insane\u00bb.\n\nThis war doesn\u2019t look sustainable, including for Russia. It can\u2019t go on for long. What are the elements to agree at least on a real ceasefire?\n\n\u00abFirst, Ukraine must be a completely demilitarized neutral country \u2013 no heavy arms, for whatever of Ukraine remains. This should be guaranteed by outside powers, including Russia, and no military exercises should take place in the country if one of the guarantors is against it. Ukraine should be a peaceful buffer, hopefully sending back some of the arms systems deployed in recent years\u00bb.\n\nUkraine needs security guarantees, it needs to be able to defend itself or it will not be a sovereign country anymore.\n\n\u00abI am sorry but Italy and most European countries cannot defend themselves either\u00bb.\n\nThey belong to NATO\u2026\n\n\u00abThey have been saving on security. That is how they got themselves into this awkward position that Europe is not considered to be a serious actor in the world. Switzerland and Austria are neutral, but are safe. So can Ukraine\u00bb.\n\nDo you realize that after what you just said, the debate in Italy will move towards investing more on defense?\n\n\u00abYou are welcome. One of the grave mistakes of the Europeans in the last decades is that they didn\u2019t invest in their security, under their ideal of eternal peace. But I think European nations should be able to defend themselves, because they have real threats coming from the South and the world is becoming a very dangerous place as international relations are collapsing. The question is more against whom Italy would like to arm. Against Russia? Well, that would be insane. But you need a more robust military force. You are living in a very dangerous place in the world. If you depend on America, you are selling out your own security and sovereignty because the Americans have their own interests\u00bb.\n\nThe EU seems to be moving towards cutting dependence from Russian energy \u2013 first coal, then oil and finally natural gas. Did you expect that?\n\n\u00abI hope you are not suicidal. Of course that would damage Russia, too, but Europe would undermine its economy and its social situation. I hope it will not happen, because you can calculate your own interests. If you don\u2019t want our coal, we will sell it somewhere else. If you don\u2019t want our oil, after a time and some losses, we will sell it elsewhere. And if you don\u2019t want gas, well, well, we can also eventually redirect it after some suffering. Russians support Putin at 81% now, people are ready for a rough period\u00bb.\n\nDo you think Italy and Europe could do something to broker a deal?\n\n\u00abNot easy, given the situation. But what they could do is try to stop this Russophobia, akin anti-semitism of the previous centuries, this satanization of Russia that would lead us eventually to a worse confrontation than we have now. Even Russian culture is being erased in Europe by a new cancel culture\u00bb.\n\nFrom our partner RIAC",

But Ukrianian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also pointing the finger at former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He invited her to Bucha, to see for herself \"what the policy of 14 years of concessions to Russia has led to.\"\n\nIt was 14 years ago, in 2008, that Merkel, together with France's then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, helped block NATO's membership invitation to Ukraine during an alliance summit in Bucharest. They saw it as a provocation to Russia.\n\nZelenskyy has called that decision a \"miscalculation\" that has led to Ukraine now \"fighting for our lives in the most horrific war in Europe since World War II.\"\n\nDespite the rejection, NATO allies did agree at the summit to an unspecified timeline for Ukraine, along with Georgia, to become members.\n\nWatch video 03:04 'Mood in Germany has shifted significantly' after Bucha atrocities\n\nNord Stream 2 despite Crimea\n\nMerkel's government continued to deny Ukraine weapons deliveries after Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. At the same time, Germany approved the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under the Baltic \u2014 which meant less gas potentially flowing through Ukraine, from which the country earns transit fees.\n\n\"How else should Moscow understand that than as a tacit acceptance of a violent border shift?\" said Henning Hoff, the executive editor of Internationale Politik Quarterly, a magazine from the German Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nGermany's EU partners, such as Poland, have also noted Merkel's silence on the issue.\n\n\"Ms. Chancellor, you have said nothing since the beginning of the war,\" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said. \"German policy in the last 10 to 15 years has led to today's Russia enjoying a strength based on its monopoly over the sale of raw materials.\"\n\nMerkel's successor, Olaf Scholz, has blocked important sanctions from the European Union, he added.\n\nWatch video 03:52 Should trade with Russia continue?\n\nForeign policy as self-deception\n\nThe criticism goes beyond the previous and current German chancellors. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's president and former foreign minister, has also been accused of cozy relations with Russia.\n\n\"The relationship was fundamental, even holy, regardless what happened,\" Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, wrote in the Tagesspiegel, a German daily. \"Even an unprovoked war makes no difference.\"\n\nIt is among the harshest criticism an ambassador has ever publicly leveled at a German official.\n\nThe last 30 years of German foreign, security and trade policies are being called into question. \"Much too much dialogue and much too little hardball with the Kremlin,\" Melnyk wrote.\n\nFormer Chancellor Schr\u00f6der has entertained the closest ties with Putin, but other former leaders are now in hot water over their policies of appeasing the Kremlin\n\n\"Every German government since Putin became president has signaled that a smooth relationship with Moscow is more important than the fate of Ukraine. This encouraged the Kremlin's attack,\" Stephan Bierling, a political scientist at the University of Regensburg, told DW.\n\nCritics, including the United States and EU countries, have noted that Germany's adherence to a policy of Wandel durch Handel (\"change through trade\") is not limited to dealings with Russia, but with China, too. They have warned that engagement without strings attached will not lead to the desired liberalization of these autocratic regimes.\n\nAdmitting mistakes\n\nSteinmeier has since admitted that many aspects of Germany's Russia policy were \"poor assessments.\" Sticking to Nord Stream 2 has cost the country credibility, he said, but it was impossible to know how Putin would act.\n\nThe second Chechen War, which was raging as Putin first assumed the presidency, was already evidence of his \"criminal, hypernationalist\" character, Hoff said.\n\nMerkel, in a statement through a spokesperson, has stuck to her decision to block Ukraine's NATO accession, which remains the general position of the alliance itself, even as many of its members send Ukraine weapons with which to fight Russian troops. That includes Germany, in a major reversal of policy not to supply weapons to parties actively involved in conflict.\n\nZelenskyy, Merkel, Macron, and Putin met in 2019 under the Normandy format to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine\n\nRoom for negotiation\n\nDespite the strong criticism, and calls to beef up the Bundeswehr, there remains interest in Germany's playing a diplomatic role. In negotiations with Putin, \"we need Chancellor Olaf Scholz's personal leadership,\" Melnyk told the news agency Reuters. \"This would be a litmus test for the new German foreign policy.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian ambassador has also expressed support for the Normandy Format, a peace initiative between France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, which began under Merkel and Melnyk said he wants to see Scholz continue.\n\nThat comes with one condition: The Ukrainians want to bring the United States into those talks, which so far the EU powers have been reluctant to do.\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Every billboard also has a slogan reading \u201cStop Russia now!\u201d A separate billboard says that \u201cblood oil fuels Russia\u2019s genocide of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRusza kampania #StopRussiaNow.

Nothing special is happening there,\u201d he said, adding that restrictions might have some effect, but only in the long run.\n\nMorawiecki then called for \u201ccrushing sanctions \u2026 much stronger than those that have been imposed.\u201d The move comes as Washington and Brussels are reportedly discussing sanctions designed to hit Russia\u2019s energy sector. So far, Western nations have mostly targeted Russian finances and banking, while the EU has also banned Russia\u2019s coal imports.\n\nWhile the US introduced a total ban on energy from Russia, which was echoed by Canada, Australia, and Japan, EU member states have been split on the matter. Many European nations largely dependent on Russia\u2019s energy imports opposed an outright immediate ban on Russian oil and gas.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned in March that cutting off such imports immediately could cause \u201cmass unemployment, poverty, people who can\u2019t heat their homes.\u201d Austria admitted on Saturday that it simply cannot afford to ban imports of Russian gas.\n\nEven the US has been cautious about the possibility of an EU-wide oil and gas embargo against Russia, arguing it could drastically increase global oil prices and harm economies in Europe and beyond.\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.",

Around 700 million denial-of-service attacks mainly from outside of Europe were launched against the websites of the Estonian president, foreign ministry, police and public services agencies on Thursday and Friday, the Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team said.\n\nThe impact has so far been minimal, the authority said. The website of a NATO cybersecurity center in Estonia, which this week hosted a global exercise with 2,000 participants from 32 countries, was among the websites that were temporarily down. The pro-Kremlin hacker group Killnet has claimed to be behind the attacks, a military spokeswoman said on Friday.\n\nHalliburton Says It Must End Some Deals in Russia by May 15 (5:13 p.m.)\n\nHalliburton Co. said that sanctions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other nations require the company to wind down certain contracts in Russia by May 15.\n\nThe company also said that the total net book value of its assets in Russia is about $340 million, and warned the invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions could cause the company to take a charge related to those assets.\n\nEU Suggests Companies Should Keep Paying for Russia Gas in Euros (5:03 p.m.)\n\nThe European Union has suggested that companies could keep paying for gas in euros, as it published guidance that Moscow\u2019s decree calling for payment in rubles would violate sanctions.\n\nThe commission confirmed a preliminary assessment that the decree would run against European sanctions imposed on Russia. It also said the decree doesn\u2019t automatically preclude allowing companies to continue paying in euros, and the scope for exemptions is not yet clear. The commission advised companies to seek confirmation from Moscow that this was possible.\n\nU.S. Leaves World Bank-IMF Meeting in Protest as Russia Speaks (4:46 p.m.)\n\nOfficials representing the U.S., Germany, Japan, and other nations walked out of a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund gathering on Friday when Russia\u2019s envoy started speaking, the second such action at a high-profile gathering in Washington this week, people familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe representatives were attending a meeting of the institution\u2019s development committee, according to the people, who declined to be identified because the gathering is private. The committee is a ministerial-level forum of the World Bank and the IMF for intergovernmental consensus-building on development issues and has 25 members, usually ministers of finance or development, according to its website.\n\nRussia Faces \u2018Reverse Industrialization\u2019 Amid Sanctions (2:11 p.m.)\n\nRussia faces a deep and prolonged economic contraction along with higher inflation and reduced living standards, as sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies sap it of vital products and technology, according to economists at the central bank.\n\nIn its most detailed public statement on the outlook since the war started, the Bank of Russia warned that \u201cthe depth of the contraction may be quite significant and exit trajectory drawn out in time\u201d because the supply shocks triggered by sanctions are unlikely to fade quickly. It said Russia would experience \u201creverse industrialization\u201d as sanctions forced it to seek lower-tech replacements for western goods that were cut off.\n\nGeneral Says Kremlin Seeks Full Control of Southern Ukraine (11:04 a.m.)\n\nA top general said the Kremlin aims to secure control of the entire south of Ukraine as well as the eastern Donbas region, Russia\u2019s state-run Tass and RIA Novosti reported.\n\nMajor General Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Central Military District, spoke in Ekaterinburg. It\u2019s unclear whether his statements reflect official Kremlin objectives.\n\nRussia wants to create a land bridge to Crimea as well to influence key aspects of Ukraine\u2019s economy, including major Black Sea ports, he said. Ultimately the Kremlin wants access to Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria, which lies to the northwest of Odesa.\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "text": "\u00a9 Getty Images / simon2579 via RT\n\nMandelaw Bageru\n\nmandelawb@gmail.com\n\nFormed in the aftermath of World War II, NATO is a military alliance built on the principle of collective defense \u2014 meaning that all NATO countries agree to come to the defense of any individual member that comes under attack. Russia considers NATO to be a direct threat, and Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the possibility that Ukraine might join motivated his decision to launch the Russian invasion. Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry has also warned of serious military and political consequences if Sweden and Finland join the alliance. All these three countries are lately seeking to do that.\n\nSo is it worth provoking Putin and Russia to add Ukraine, Sweden, and Finland into the NATO alliance club? This issue requires serious look beyond the current hasty phobia-led and unequal political standing among nations.\n\nRussia\u2019s NATO-coerced invasion of parts of Eastern Ukraine has brought the dangerous likelihood of nuclear war into a new contemporary global political focus. Sadly, in response to the Russo-Ukraine protracted war crisis, many countries are opting to boost their respective military spending, much to the delight of weapons contractors and the arms industry. Even more alarming are the calls for increased investments in nuclear capabilities by nuclear-armed states, and the calls for deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons into countries that currently do not host them.\n\nIt is clearly known for generations how the four-pronged phobias have been causing inequality among global nations, simply rooted in erroneously perceived generalities of: (a) Russo-phobia, (b) Sino-phobia (c) Islam-phobia and (d) Afro-phobia. These phobic and irrational attitudes can easily trigger the jeopardy for nuclear bomb possibilities and the 3rd world war to occur suddenly.\n\nNuclear Bomb Proliferation and Flexing for Fight\n\nIt has been proven time and time again that on its own nuclear weapon can upset and/or destroy a city, by killing hundreds of thousands or even millions of people.\n\nFor instance, according to NukeMap:\n\nIf the largest Russian nuclear bomb were to be dropped on New York City, then over eight million people would be killed, and another nearly seven million injured. The U.S. already has an estimated one hundred nuclear weapons in Europe. Five NATO countries \u2014 Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Germany \u2014 take part in a nuclear sharing arrangement, each hosting twenty U.S. nuclear weapons. Germany, in addition to hosting U.S. nukes, is also ramping up its military spending to the tune of 100 billion Euros. In a major shift in German policy, the country has committed to spending more than 2% of its GDP on the military. Germany has also committed to buying US-made F-35 aircraft \u2014 jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons \u2014 to replace its own Tornado fighter jets. In Poland, a country that borders Ukraine and Russian ally \u2013 Belarus, does not have any nuclear weapons, yet, the leader of the ruling right-wing national-conservative Law and Justice Party says they are now \u201copen\u201d to the US putting nuclear weapons there.\n\nThe nuclear fever isn\u2019t just in Europe. China is accelerating its nuclear buildup amidst the rising fears of conflicts with the U.S.A \u2014 with Taiwan as a forthcoming flashpoint. On its part, China plans to build one hundred land-based nuclear missile silos, and a Pentagon report claims they\u2019ll have one thousand nuclear warheads by the end of the decade. This will add to the nearly thirteen thousand nuclear weapons that already exist globally. China is also nearing completion of its own nuclear triad \u2014 the ability to launch nuclear weapons by land, sea, and air \u2014 which, according to conventional wisdom, would secure its nuclear deterrence strategy.\n\nAdditionally, North Korea has restarted its ICBM program and recently launched a test missile for the first time since 2017. North Korea claims the missile to be a \u201cpowerful nuclear war deterrent,\u201d the same rationale every other nuclear-armed country uses for building and maintaining nuclear weapons.\n\nU.S. allies in the region aren\u2019t immune to the calls for nuclear weapons. Influential former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, who has long pushed for a more militarized Japan, recently called for the country to consider hosting U.S. nuclear weapons \u2014 despite Japan being the only place on Earth to know firsthand the horror wrought directly onto people by a nuclear-weapons attack. Luckily, the comments received pushback from current leader Fumio Kishida, who called the idea \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nBut too many leaders are not responsibly resisting the call for more nuclear weapons. Rather, neighboring countries to Russia like Finland, Sweden and others in the region are in hurry to be admitted into the NATO-Forces-Club in an attempt to squeeze Russia out of shape.\n\nOn his part, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, besides his calls for a No-Fly Zone, he recently told 60 Minutes: \u201cThe world is saying today that some people are politically hiding behind claims that \u2018we cannot stand up for Ukraine because there could be a nuclear war\u2026believing that by not helping Ukraine, you will hide from Russian nukes. I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019\u201d Zelensky appears to suggest that no matter if the West engages in a direct conventional military confrontation with Russia or not, a nuclear confrontation is a foregone conclusion. Zelensky\u2019s language that implies unavoidable nuclear attacks and a necessity for increased military intervention only pushes Russia closer to launching a nuclear attack \u2014 and the world toward a global nuclear war. This is not a path that Ukraine or the world should want to take. What is needed is more diplomacy.\n\nThe U.S. hasn\u2019t made things better. Instead, it is blatantly refusing to adopt \u201cno first use\u201d as official policy, the same nuclear policy shared by Russia \u2014 a policy that is striking fear across the globe right now, including majority of people in the U.S. who are now worried about a nuclear attack. This is doubly alarming considering the U.S.\u2019s history of fabricating evidence to go to war, as happened with George W. Bush\u2019s lies about WMDs in Iraq and the falsified Gulf of Tonkin incident that was used as a pretext to escalate the Vietnam War.\n\nCredibility of the Human Rights Council\n\nOn 7 April the UN General Assembly (GA) decided to suspend Russia\u2019s membership in the Human Rights Council. This hasty action establishes a destructive precedent not only for the future of the Human Rights Council, but also for the future of other United Nations institutions\u2019 existence and exercises around the globe. This biased action doesn\u2019t promote transparency. Rather, it challenges the idea that a few powerful countries can tank not only the Security Council initiatives but also the GA, without much is justified as a consensus or an explanation.\n\nObviously, this undigested hurried move was a big blow to Russia\u2019s prestige at the UN-forums, and adds bad precedence to the latent yet general atmosphere of Russo-phobia provoked by NATO pact hooligans. In the past we have seen similar collective actions imposed on a number of nations as well. This sets supremacy attitudes in the future in which unbalanced efforts will be made to exclude other countries from membership in the Human Rights Council too.\n\nIf the political trail is managed fairly, then, one could think of excluding several NATO countries or even NATO itself as an entity, for the war crimes and crimes committed against humanity by NATO forces during the wars of aggression against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and former Yugoslavia. Incidentally, one could think of excluding the UK for having extended its colonial arms invisibly through Saudi Arabia because of the protracted civil war committed in intensifying civil strife among ethnic groups in Yemen; or between Pakistan and India for its systematic war crimes and gross violations of human rights against the people of Kashmir, including widespread extra-judicial executions.\n\nAnother credible candidate for suspension would have been Azerbaijan because of its aggression against the unfortunate Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh during the Blitzkrieg of September-November 2020, where war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed, including torture and execution of Armenian prisoners of war. We could think of excluding for using its puppet regimes forcibly appointed in Colombia to carryout lethal para-military activities and consistent pattern of killing human rights defenders, social activist leaders, syndicalist and indigenous peoples.\n\nThus, it is not worth shedding popular tears over the UN Human Rights Council, whose authority and credibility are seriously jeopardized and still remain questionable; and whose resolutions are routinely ignored by many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel. Since its formation in 2006 the Human Rights Council has not served human rights well \u2013 but it has certainly served the geopolitical and informational interests of the global expansionist club members including, but not limited to, United States, the European Union, and the NATO alliance member countries.\n\nThe GA decision also puts a further nail on the coffin of the UN-General Assembly itself. It manifests how this Assembly can and is manipulated by the United States and by the bullying, arm-twisting and blackmailing practices of the Department of State. Countries have been overtly told to: \u201cTake the US-NATO way, or else, take the highway.\u201d\n\nFar more serious for the world are the economic sanctions and financial blockade imposed by the US and EU countries on Russia, which will have a long-lasting impact on the world economy, hurting the most vulnerable not only in Russia, but also in Europe, Africa, North and South America, and Asia.\n\nThe decision of the UN-General Assembly (GA) sets a dangerous precedent and further politicizes the Human Rights Council. One would think that precisely because some countries do not like what Russia is doing that they would like to \u201ctame\u201d it by involving it in the human rights work of the Council. Isolating a country is always counter-productive. What is needed is greater inclusion and greater debate \u2013 not exclusion and hate-mongering. In this respect, the GA vote illustrates the success of the \u201cinformation war\u201d that has been waged against Russia for decades \u2013 not just since 2022, not even since 2014 and the Maidan coup \u2013 long before there was systematic dis-information about Russia and a consistent negative narrative. This has a simple explanation: NATO has had no raison d\u2019\u00eatre since the Warsaw Pact was dismantled in 1991. In order to continue existing, NATO must have an \u201cenemy\u201d \u2013 and that is the only role that the US and NATO assigned to Russia. The Russian bogeyman is necessary and guarantees that the US military-industrial-financial complex can continue its war on the world and on the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n\nSignals Put Before the General Assembly\n\nThe allegations of war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces in Bucha in the vicinity of Kiev precipitated this move by the US to have Russia removed from the Human Rights Council. How much do we know about the events? While Ukraine accused Russia of murdering 400 civilians in Bucha before retreating from the town, the Russian government has refuted these allegations, pointing out that Russian forces withdrew in an orderly fashion on 30 March and that no allegations of extra judicial executions were made until 2 April 2022, four days later, when Ukrainian security forces and TV cameras arrived in Bucha. The US and NATO accepted Kiev\u2019s claims uncritically and used them to justify imposing further sanctions against Russia. However, serious doubts have arisen about a possible staged events and tampering with the photos and videos. After all, fake news has been in the global arena sawing intentionally spread misinformation propaganda news in recent decades since the war in Iraq.\n\nSo the serious question is: Do we have here another false flag operation as we have seen multiple times in Iraq Syria and Libya, staged chemical attacks that could not be confirmed by expert inspectors? Are the dead persons\u2019 civilians or military? Were the bodies of those of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian-civilian-victims of artillery bombardment? Were the bodies Russian soldiers wearing white armbands or Ukrainian civilians with white armbands to signal their peaceful intentions and subsequently lynched by Ukrainian extremists for collaboration with the Russians? One day we may find out whether the US had advance knowledge of the alleged crimes in Bucha or whether it was involved in manufacturing fake evidence for the information and psychological warfare. Of course, nobody knows. What we need is whistleblowers, more like Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. The classical mass media is no longer trustworthy; it has been long time since it proved to stage fake news even utilizing its social media wing.\n\nAn international commission of inquiry should investigate, but that will take time, because the evidence on the ground (to the extent it has not been destroyed) must be evaluated and witnesses on all sides must be heard. Gradually some information is coming out that does not confirm Ukrainian claims, and in a series of recorded satellite phone calls, a reporter identified as \u201cSimon\u201d tells his colleagues that at Borodyanka \u201cthere\u2019s no bodies in the streets at all\u201d, contrary to what he had been led to believe.\n\nApparently the town had been \u201cshelled to pieces\u201d, but it is not clear whether this was committed by Russian or Ukrainian artillery. In any event, Simon concluded \u201cthere is no evidence of any rights abuses here\u201d. Simon and his crew interviewed residents who reported that the Russian soldiers had been correct and given them food, water and other supplies. Simon concluded: \u201cI do not know what the prosecutor was talking about, but we have seen nothing like that. It is a completely different picture.\u201d An international investigation is justified and necessary, but any ad hoc commission must investigate allegations of crimes committed not only by Russian soldiers but also by Ukrainian soldiers and para-militaries, in particular against the Russian-Ukrainians of Lugansk and Donetsk since 2014, and the pogrom against 50 Russian-Ukrainians in Odessa in May 2014.\n\nTherefore, it could be said without fear of contradiction, that the GA vote was prematurely orchestrated hasty and coercive and cursive drama that left an added failure by this global entity. Sad enough, the GA violated the general principles of law concerning due process to be followed and the presumption of innocence. Above all, with due respect, the GA must have given the floor and the opportunity to entertain Russia\u2019s evidence and arguments and given due weight for conflict triggering matters with all fairness. The absence of due process is yet another disgrace for the General Assembly to gang up and take irrational, persuasive, hooligan type of nosy decision making forum without having any evidence put forward from either side to backstop its hasty resolution.\n\nThe UN-General Assembly\u2019s Double Standards\n\nThis is not the first and will not be the last time that the UN-General Assembly (GA) applies double standards and adopts flawed resolutions or decisions simply to please The USA, EU and the NATO alliance. It seems like the entire United Nations system has been hijacked by the West and has the full support of a homologated corporate media that acts as the echo chamber of the State Department.\n\nAnother example of shaky-double-standards and selective indignation: The International Criminal Court. We hear politicians demand a \u201cNuremberg\u201d Trial against Putin. Well, why not a Tribunal to investigate and condemn the crimes of aggression committed by Bill Clinton in Yugoslavia, by George W. Bush and Tony Blair in Iraq, by Barack Obama in Libya, Syria and Ukraine (after all, Obama was president when the \u201cno fly\u201d zone over Libya was manipulated for \u201cregime change\u201d. Worldwide, it has been recalled Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous words: \u201cWe came, we saw, he died\u201d.\n\nAny tribunal show should clearly investigate the crimes committed by Ukrainian sharp-shooters at Maidan in connection with the 2014 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the democratically elected President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovich. Was it not the legitimate legal duty or responsibility of the International Criminal Court also to investigate and prosecute the NATO forces from the US, UK, Germany, and Australia, who committed atrocities in Afghanistan and Iraq? How about the torture centers used in clandestine in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay? How about the use of indiscriminate weapons including depleted uranium weapons, white phosphorus and cluster bombs, causing tens of thousands of deaths? How about all the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d visited upon civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya?\n\nWhere is the accountability for all of these crimes? The International Criminal Court will not have any credibility until it decides to apply the Statute of Rome seriously and go after the likes of George W. Bush and Joe Biden. Hitherto the West has \u201cgotten away with it\u201d \u2013 but for how long? Will the ICC remain in the service of the West, as a strong arm of the Pentagon? Hitherto we have observed the culture of impunity that protects Western leaders. Will the rule of law ever evolve into the rule of justice? This is the real unanswered question that remains in limbo.\n\nInternational Court of Justice (ICC)\n\nEstablished in 2002 by the Rome Statute, the ICC has 123 member states where it can investigate and prosecute crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and state acts of aggression. (Ukraine has also not formally joined the court, but has submitted to its jurisdiction in the past.\n\nInternational court of Justice (ICC) affairs, after World War II, the prominent Nuremberg trials, led by the U.S. and allied powers, prosecuted Nazi war criminals. The U.S. has also backed international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone, which have held high-ranking individuals accountable for terrible crimes.\n\nBut the trouble to put the ICC into effective appliance of justice is when a state is too powerful to be bound by ICC\u2019s demands and decisions. The problem isn\u2019t about the absence of globally assured law but rather its breakdown, when states refuse to comply and aren\u2019t held accountable. This can further inflame conflicts unequal treatment of weaker nations in front of the ICC. The resulting pattern of war, displacement, and rampant human rights violations we\u2019re seeing in Ukraine has tragically become all too familiar due to the provocation of the 30 NATO pact members due to the Russophobes and their hooligan actions to squeeze and suffocate the Russian Republics and its citizens. So Russia had to protect itself before NATO takes over Ukraine against the treatment it signed in previous years.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not just Russia that seems not to pay attention to what the ICC rules and regulations are all about. Since the recent past, side-lining the ICC is true of the USA as well.\n\nFirstly, when President Bill Clinton signed the Rome Statute, he advised against U.S. ratification out of concern that the court could assert jurisdiction over U.S. officials and service members. Secondly, President George W. Bush then famously \u201cunsigned\u201d the Rome Statute less than one year before his illegal invasion of Iraq. Thirdly, when the Trump administration went so far as to sanction ICC prosecutors who were investigating possible U.S. crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nThe most powerful nations like U.S., China, Russia, India, etc., should have set exemplary relationships with the ICC \u2014 and the global rule of law more broadly. Yet on its part, the ICC is more tilted to the Western powers and active in helping the USA and NATO pact members in their intervention to upset weaker nations in their own rights than to sand firm equally to all its members with due respect and fairness.\n\nLooking at a resolution now in the USA Congress introduced by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) that calls for the U.S. to join the ICC, it is certain this will also be side lined as business as usual. That means, another resolution is required to repeal the 2002 law that prohibits the U.S. A\u2019s support for ICC investigations.\n\nIn principle, no country should stand in the way of accountability and remedy for global victims of conflict, whether in Ukraine, Palestine, Yemen, or elsewhere. This includes the United States, which must also reckon with its own crimes committed during the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine.\n\nUsually, Washington has been seeking supremacy by imposing ad hoc rules by masking itself under the mantle of human rights violation, humanitarian aids, and violation of international law. These are systematically devised excuses meant to advance both the US and NATO\u2019s joint militaristic interests at the cost of upsetting lives and livelihoods in Ukraine and elsewhere around the globe.\n\n\u201cWe cannot successfully cooperate with the rest of the world in establishing a reign of law,\u201d warned Robert H. Jackson, the chief U.S. prosecutor at Nuremberg, \u201cunless we are prepared to have that law sometimes operate against what would be our national advantage.\u201d\n\nFrom the outset, it was clear, Russia is among the nations who would not submit itself to Washington\u2019s will of global dominance. Instead, Russia, China and India are working hard to strengthen efforts aimed at the Non-allied nations\u2019 forum for power balance. In this regard, just like China, Russia is fighting to be part of an international community of equals and will not allow Western nations to ignore its legitimate security concerns which it attempted to clarify far ahead of the NATO proxy attempt to expand itself into Ukraine and further squeeze Russia outside of the global political and economic arena. In self-defense, Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine is meant to put an end to NATO\u2019s regional domination as well as the US-dominated world order.\n\nThe answer to the threat of nuclear weapons is not more nuclear weapons. The answer is a planet that engages in genuine disarmament with a goal of no nuclear weapons. The answer is to strengthen an international community of equals that will not easily consent Western nations to ignore their respective legitimate security concerns nationally and regionally.\n\nYet, Law alone won\u2019t deliver global justice. But if we want fewer wars, more diplomacy, and more international cooperation, then no country can remain above it.\n\n__\n\n\n\n\n\nTo publish article on borkena, please send a submission to info@borkena.com for consideration.\n\nJoin the conversation.

            "text": "Former President Dmitry Medvedev's opinion article in the daily Kommersant in October 2021, ahead of Russia's massive military buildup along the Ukrainian border, was as surreal as it was acerbic.\n\nMedvedev, who owes his political career and his seemingly enormous wealth to Russian President Vladimir Putin, lashed out at Ukraine's leaders, calling them \"weak,\" \"nonindependent,\" and corrupt and adding there was no sense in negotiating with them.\n\nIn the article, which Western analysts described as \"chauvinistic,\" Medvedev described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, as beholden to \"the most rabid nationalist forces\" and accused him of \"completely chang[ing]\" his political and moral compass.\n\n\"One can only imagine how revolting it was for [Zelenskiy] to commit such a moral somersault,\" he said in the October 11 commentary.\n\nTo many Kremlin observers, Medvedev could have been talking about himself.\n\nThe 56-year-old former lawyer once represented the hopes of Russian liberals seeking democratic change. When Putin picked him to become president in 2008, many put doubts about the motives of the senior partner in the ruling \"tandem\" aside and latched onto the idea that reforms were in the offing.\n\nNearly 15 years later, a different Medvedev jumps out from the page. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 and has remained in the Kremlin ever since, steadily shutting the door on dissent and bringing the country into increasing confrontation with Kyiv and the West.\n\nAnd in recent months, as Putin narrowed his inner circle to a handful of hard-liners, launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, and taken the clampdown in Russia to new levels, Medvedev has done a flip -- at least verbally -- to stay in his patron's good graces.\n\nThe October commentary was one of several caustic articles, social-media posts, or remarks that Medvedev has issued in recent months, some of them echoing the outlandish kind of historical revisionism that Putin has used to vilify the West and underpin the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBellicose Name-Calling\n\nIn Russia's current bilious climate, with officials, lawmakers, and state TV guests seemingly vying to top one another in terms of belligerence, they may not seem outlandish. But they sharply contrast with Medvedev's established image as a mild-mannered, iPhone-toting technocrat.\n\n\"It's not so much the content. It's the tone -- the name calling. I don't remember Medvedev being like that earlier in his career,\" Brian Taylor, a professor of political science at Syracuse University who focuses on Russian politics, told RFE/RL. He said that Medvedev -- who lost a lot of power and influence when he was ousted as prime minister two years ago -- is trying to \"stay relevant\" politically.\n\nIn a March social-media post, Medvedev compared Polish, Slovak, and Czech leaders traveling by train to Kyiv to show support to Zelenskiy -- a transportation choice dictated by Russia's war in Ukraine -- to Vladimir Lenin's return trip to Russia from self-imposed exile in 1917, ahead of the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nMedvedev claimed that the Polish elite suffers from Russophobia due to anger over having lost control of the throne in Moscow 400 years ago -- an assertion that ignores far greater and more recent factors, such as the decades of repressive Soviet dominance over Poland and its neighbors.\n\nTimothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University who is an author and an expert on the region, called the post \"grotesque\" and said that Medvedev was trying to position himself as a populist speaking for ordinary citizens in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"But he is himself a caricature of the global elite, wealthy for no reason, trying to dictate to people in a foreign country what they should do and how they should think, endorsing a war of destruction in the name of nothing more, in the end, than his own personal comfort,\" Snyder wrote in a blog post.\n\nStanding By His Man, And His Money\n\nA 2017 investigation by now-imprisoned opposition leader Aleksei Navalny and his associates alleged that Medvedev used an array of charity and nonprofit organizations to collect $1.2 billion in donations from tycoons and state banks and then redirected the funds to purchase pricey assets, including luxury homes.\n\nMaria Snegovaya, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank, says the upsurge in Medvedev's belligerent public rhetoric is an attempt to demonstrate loyalty to Putin at a time of growing political infighting. \"Medvedev may want to signal to everyone that he is part of the system, that he is essentially by Putin's side,\" she told RFE/RL.\n\n\"I think he is desperate to at least secure some safety. His goal right now is to survive [within the system], not to climb his way back on the top of the vertical,\" she said, a reference to Medvedev's loss of influence since the end of presidency in 2012 and his loss of the prime minister's post in 2020.\n\nMedvedev once represented an influential faction in the constellation of competing groups that Putin uses to maintain power. But he has lost significant political weight over the years and some of his allies -- such as former Open Government Minister Mikhail Abyzov and the businessmen brothers Ziyavudin and Magomed Magomedov -- have ended up behind bars.\n\nMedvedev himself has fallen out of Putin's narrowing inner circle, now dominated by hawks with security-service backgrounds, in part due to the embarrassing allegations of corruption, analysts have said.\n\n'Fifth Column Of Traitors'\n\nAnd with the war in Ukraine clouding Russia's future, the atmosphere in the circles of power surrounding Putin may be tenser than ever.\n\nDenunciations and attacks on \"weak elements\" within the elite are on the rise \"and will become a big part of the dynamic,\" Snegovaya said, especially as the economy shrinks following the imposition of strict Western sanctions over the invasion.\n\nPutin has come out hard against any opposition to the war in Ukraine. In a chilling speech in mid-March, he asserted that there was a \"fifth column of national traitors\" inside the country and that Russians \"will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors.\"\n\nReports of senior Russian officials being put under house arrest have emerged in recent weeks following the initial failures in the war against Ukraine. Hard-line hawks within the elite may suspect Medvedev and his associates of not fully supporting the war, potentially making him an \"attractive\" target for attacks, Snegovaya said.\n\nArkady Dvorkovich, a former close adviser to Medvedev, was accused by a senior lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party of \"national betrayal\" last month after expressing concerns about the war and sympathy for civilians in Ukraine.\n\nDvorkovich soon stepped down as chairman of the Skolkovo Foundation, a technology hub located in Moscow region that emulates Silicon Valley and which Medvedev promoted on a trip to the United States during his presidency.\n\nRemember The 'Reset'?\n\nMedvedev, 56, has been one of Putin's most loyal allies over the past two decades. Putin tapped the former lawyer to succeed him as president in 2008 in order to avoid violating what was then a constitutional limit of two consecutive four-year terms.\n\nPutin's choice of Medvedev over fellow former KGB officer Sergei Ivanov \"signaled the possibility of a new, more liberal period in Russian politics, or so some hoped,\" Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow in 2012-14, wrote in his memoir, From Cold War To Hot Peace. Medvedev \"spoke a more sophisticated style of Russian than Putin, and seemed more orientated to, or at least familiar with, Western ideas,\" he wrote.\n\nMedvedev is not from the KGB and is a member of a generation of Russians who as a rule viewed the West and the collapse of the Soviet Union -- which came when he was in his 20s and Putin was almost 40 -- in a more positive light than their elders.\n\nIn a September 2009 article laying out his political vision, Medvedev described Russia's democracy as \"fragile\" and something that \"needs to be protected.\" He called for dialogue with civil society and touted changes he made to improve electoral competition. \"Putin had never said that,\" McFaul wrote.\n\nAs he was grooming his former campaign manager and fellow St. Petersburg native for the top job, Putin said that Medvedev could sometimes be tougher than him -- a remark that later seemed to presage Russia's invasion in Georgia in August 2008, three months after he took office.\n\nBut despite that move, Medvedev's presidency did seem to promise change, both at home and in ties with the West.\n\nHe pursued reforms at home and embraced President Barack Obama's \"reset\" of U.S.-Russia ties, signing the New START nuclear arms-reduction treaty with Obama in April 2010 and then smiling over cheeseburgers with him and enthusiastically taking in Silicon Valley during his U.S. visit that June.\n\nOn The Outside Looking In\n\nMedvedev's metamorphosis, if that is what it is, did not occur overnight. It slowly followed the sharp and steady souring of Russian-U.S. relations that can be traced to the end of 2011, when Putin accused the United States of fomenting protests over fraud-marred parliamentary elections and his decision -- announced by himself and Medvedev that September -- to return to the presidency in 2012.\n\nPutin swapped jobs with Medvedev, who remained in the No. 2 spot as prime minister until January 2020. Analysts said Putin replaced Medvedev as head of the government after he failed to deliver on the president's domestic priorities, including improving living standards.\n\nBut the shakeup also came as Putin was preparing constitutional amendments, adopted that July, that allow him to run for president again in 2024 and 2030, a move that seemed aimed to quash talk of a post-Putin Russia and ensure he could stay in power for years.\n\nPutin created a new role for Medvedev as deputy chairman of the Security Council, which is one of his main venues for decision-making on strategic issues but is a purely advisory body. Some analysts see the position as a sort of political retirement home for Medvedev. Putin is unlikely to \"put him in a position of trust anymore,\" Taylor said.\n\nMedvedev is among the top politicians least trusted by Russians, according to opinion polls, and Putin barred him from heading the United Russia party ticket for the September 2021 parliamentary elections.\n\nStarting around that time, Medvedev seems to have been seeking to step back into the spotlight with his acerbic, hawkish statements that are aligned with the rhetoric on state TV.\n\nThe new image as a brash Russian nationalist \"doesn't really fit him very well\" but may be part of a strategy to get back into a position of power at a later date, Taylor said.\n\n\"I think he -- maybe unrealistically -- still has political ambitions and doesn't know how the regime will shake out over the next few years, and he would rather be in power than out of power,\" he said. \"He may even still think that he could get the top job again.\"",

            "text": "Looking back at the past decade-and-a-half, we can see, with the benefit of hindsight, how the current aggression of Russia against Ukraine came to pass. It was enabled by the policies of the European neo-liberal elites.\n\nOn the day when Vladimir Putin decided to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he had no reason to fear any significant consequences from the West. For years, on many occasions and despite increasingly aggressive Russian behaviour he enjoyed gestures of support and friendship from the political leaders of countries such as Germany and France. It did not matter that he attacked Georgia, it did not matter when he annexed Crimea. It was still business as usual. So, why would he think that this time it would be any other way\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nGerhard Schr\u00f6der\n\nIn between the two long stretches of CDU rule (occasionally in coalition governments with the social democrats or the FDP liberals), there were several years during which Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (SPD \u2013 Social Democratic Party) was the chancellor. AndJust weeks before the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine he echoed Russia\u2019s rhetoric by saying on his podcast that Moscow had no interest in attacking Ukraine and felt alarmed by the accumulation of Nato troops in Eastern Europe.\u201cNato has not exactly been very restrained with exercises in the Baltic or Poland,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally, that has effects on Russia\u2019s thinking and threat assessment.\u201cI hope the sabre-rattling in Ukraine will be called off, because the things I\u2019m hearing from there, including finger-pointing at Germany because of its sensible refusal to export weapons \u2014 that really takes the biscuit.\u201dAlso in February 2022, he was nominated to join the board of directors at Gazprom.Talk about bad timing\u2026\n\nAngela Merkel\n\nAngela Merkel (CDU \u2013 Christian Democratic Union) has undoubtedly had a huge impact on the German and European political landscape, having served as the Chancellor of Germany for 16 years. The only person to serve longer than her was her fellow party member and mentor, Helmut Kohl, and he only served two weeks longer than her.Even though, a number of times, leaders of such countries as Poland and Ukraine warned her, that the project is intended to apply pressure on them by circumventing them as transit countries and denying them access to energy resources.And Merkel\u2019s cabinet would attempt to peddle a narrative according to which the pipelines would INCREASE the energy security of the region, since Germany would be able to resell Russian gas to them.But all this should not come as a surprise to anyone.At a 2007 meeting with Putin in Sochi, during her first term as Chancellor, she said \u201cthat Russia, when it was still the Soviet Union, was a very reliable supplier of energy resources for decades, and we would like this to continue.\u201dPerhaps Ms Merkel thought that by making Russia reliant on German money paid for natural gas, it is somehow possible to control Russia or at least prevent it from leading an imperialist policy. But this conviction soon fired back. Russia invaded Georgia the next year, and now, 15 years later,The Kremlin realises this very well, and possibly realised it back in 2007.To be fair to her, Angela Merkel did say in March 2014 that \u201cGermany will never accept the annexation of Crimea\u201d. But the lack of acceptance for the illegal annexation of the southern Ukrainian peninsula did not translate from words to deeds. Germany continued to make business deals with Russia. The decision to construct Nord Stream 2 was made just one year after the \u201cunacceptable\u201d annexation of Crimea.It seems that nothing Russia would do could serve as a wake-up call for Ms Merkel. Speaking in 2015, while she did concede that \u201cRussia has not made further progress in the past few years toward adopting many of the ideas that we share in the G7,\u201d she still hoped that Russia can be worked with to help provide for global security in what she termed \u201cNATO-Russia partnership\u201d.\u201cWe have the Normandy format for resolving the Ukraine crisis,\u201d she said. The Normandy format has clearly failed. She also said that \u201cRussia will and must also be included in efforts to resolve the Syrian civil war.\u201d Russia was backing the authoritarian regime of Bashar al-Assad in the conflict, yet Merkel stressed that \u201cit was only with the help of Russia that chemical weapons were removed from Syria,\u201d and so \u201cwe will also be discussing how Russia can be included.\u201d\n\nOlaf Scholz\n\nRestart, reset, engagement, dialogue, negotiations\u2026 They all come down to appeasement of a Putin dictatorship that has only become more hostile. Concessions to thugs and terrorists just encourage more aggression, as always. https://t.co/jFmtlZ0ozR \u2014 Garry Kasparov (@Kasparov63) January 3, 2022\n\nFor thirty years, Germans lectured Ukrainians about fascism. When fascism actually arrived, Germans funded it, and Ukrainians died fighting it. \u2014 Timothy Snyder (@TimothyDSnyder) April 20, 2022\n\nThe current Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz (SPD) has found himself in quite a conundrum. The Russian invasion of Ukraine began less than three months into his chancellorship. But he can hardly criticise Merkel\u2019s cabinet on its policy towards Russia.The current government is formed by a \u201cTraffic Lights Coalition\u201d (red for SPD, yellow for the liberal FDP, and green for\u2026 The Greens). And Olaf Scholz\u2019s Foreign Minister in the cabinet became the then co-leader of The Greens (in Germany, The Greens always make a point of electing two leaders, a woman and a man) Annalena Baerbock.Truly, keeping his own ministers in check must have been quite a toil for Mr Scholz, especially in a situation when interests of parties which may see eye-to-eye on some issues, but have radically different agenda\u2019s on others.In January, FM Baerbock also travelled to meet with her US counterpart, Antony Blinken, and the discussion about the threat posed by Russia was one of the topics of the talks., who Tweeted:Merely a week and a half before the war broke out, Chancellor Scholz still had hopes that the conflict could be avoided. \u201cThe diplomatic possibilities are far from being exhausted,\u201d Scholz said back then. He also praised the apparent withdrawal of the Russian troops from the border with Ukraine, following yet another unannounced \u201cmilitary manoeuvres.\u201dNow that the war has started, the Chancellor and his top diplomat are of one mind at least on one thing, and that is that Germany should not supply Ukraine with weapons, ostensibly because of Germany\u2019s troubled history with war.But when it comes to that, the outcome of such attitude has probably been best summarised by Timothy Snyder, an American historian specialising in the history of Central and Eastern Europe and especially the toll that totalitarian regimes took on the people of the region, who described the outcome of such policy in such blunt terms:Mr Snyder has written numerous books about the bloodied history of the countries wedged between Germany and Russia. He can most definitely write another historical opus about the events unfolding before our eyes, but for now, that Tweet offers a pretty decent summary of what German foreign policies in Central and Eastern Europe have brought about.A few weeks ago, the German government was ridiculed for offering to send Ukraine 5,000 helmets. The Germans stepped up their game a bit and offered to provide Ukraine with assistance in the form of other equipment. But when Ukrainians presented them with a list of the necessary material, the Germans struck out any requested heavy military equipment from it, such as e.g. Leopard tanks.\n\nWhat Chancellor Scholz offered instead, was that Germany will send to Ukraine its Soviet-era equipment, that the Federal Republic of Germany inherited from the People\u2019s Army of the communist German Democratic Republic (East Germany) upon German re-unification.\n\n\n\nThe excuses for that were several, one of them being that it would diminish Germany\u2019s own defensive capabilities. And that in spite of the fact that the German military industry is perfectly well capable of manufacturing enough equipment to provide for the defensive needs of Germany and more.\n\n\n\nMany countries of the former Eastern Bloc have offered to send Ukraine their Warsaw-Pact-era equipment. The difference here is that in the case of countries such as Czechia or Poland, this equipment has been conserved to be serviceable until very recently, while their militaries were updating their weaponry to the modern western-manufactured arsenal. Whether post-Soviet equipment that would be sent by Germany is at all serviceable after spending over 30 years rotting away in warehouses is dubious at best.\n\nDonald Tusk elected head of EPP The President of the European Council and former Polish PM Donald Tusk has been elected unopposed as leader of the European People\u2019s Party (EPP) at... see more\n\nDonald Tusk\n\nThe two existing strings of the Yamal gas pipeline. Photo: Wikimedia Commons/Samuel Bailey\n\nThe former Prime Minister of Poland and once-President of the European Council said in a recent interview given to the Polish weekly \u201cPolityka\u201d, that in Brussels, he had an opinion of a Russophobe, almost monomaniacally pre-occupied with Ukraine. But for those who have an attention span longer than the four-year electoral cycle, it is not exactly the way they may remember his behaviour or his policies towards Russia prior to the annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbas in 2014 (Mr Tusk was elected the President of the EC later that year).Mr Tusk became the Prime Minister of Poland after the snap election in 2007. But Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, who ran on the Law and Justice party ticket, remained the President of Poland. This led to a conflict between the offices of the PM, now Mr Tusk, and President Kaczy\u0144ski.Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, as well as his twin brother Jaros\u0142aw (who has served and continues to serve as the head of the Law and Justice party), have always remained wary of Russian imperial ambitions, seeking closer ties with the US as the largest NATO country and the best guarantor of Poland\u2019s security. There were even plans to construct elements of a US-backed anti-missile shield in Poland to increase its defensive capabilities.These plans were cancelled following the 2007 elections to avoid tensions with Russia.According to him, \u201cthe lack of dialogue serves neither Poland nor Russia. It is bad for the interests of both countries on the international arena,\u201d adding that \u201cthe time for a change in the matter [of Polish-Russian relations] is now,\u201d and that, according to him \u201csignals from our eastern neighbour confirm that they are also maturing to reach that conclusion.\u201dThroughout most of his tenure as PM, the Tusk cabinet attempted to distance itself from the US and tie Poland closer to Brussels, including by maintaining good relations with Berlin. Berlin and the Merkel government have, as previously demonstrated, done their best to maintain good relations with Russia at any cost, and the then Polish government attempted to do the same.When in 2008 Russian forces invaded the Caucasian country of Georgia, ostensibly to protect the people of the autonomous region of South Ossetia (which after Russian victory in the war was transformed into an internationally unrecognised breakaway republic under Russian protectorate \u2013 some of our observant readers may notice a pattern there\u2026), President Kaczy\u0144ski, along with the heads of state of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia visited the beleaguered Georgia and during a rally in the country\u2019s capital of Tbilisi addressed the crowds with words that now seem prophetic:The fact that the President was conducting his own foreign policy, independent of the Prime Minister, was not well received. PM Tusk and his cabinet have been trying to pursue a policy of rapprochement with the Kremlin, and President Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s visit did not help in achieving that goal., during what was to be a visit to the Katyn Memorial, where thousands of Polish officers murdered by the Soviet NKVD are buried. There were no survivors.The catastrophe immediately sparked accusations from Law and Justice politicians and supporters against the Kremlin, accusing Putin of orchestrating an assassination of the Polish President and his entourage. Several factors were of particular concern, e.g. aeroplane was of Soviet manufacture and as such, it was serviced in Russia. To exacerbate the matter the Polish government led by Donald Tusk relinquished the investigation to the Russian side, even though it could pursue an international investigation into the crash, which sparked accusations of at best gross negligence, and at worst collusion. The Russians refused to release the wreck of the aeroplane, leaving it to be exposed to the elements and eaten away by rust on the Smolensk airfield.But in Poland, the matter of who is responsible for the death of the President and the rest of the Polish delegation only fueled the polarisation of the political scene., and even mocked those who entertained the idea.Nine years after it was proposed, and six years after the construction beganMoreover, there were plans to sign a long-term contract for the supply of Russian natural gas via the Yamal pipeline until 2037, and securing Russian transit rights through Poland for supplying Europe with natural gas until 2045.\n\nSince the pipeline splits into two branches in Belarus, whose dictator, Alyaksandr Lukashenka is Putin\u2019s vassal, and one of the branches circumvents the territory of Poland, and the other the territory of Ukraine, each of the countries could at any time see its natural gas supply cut off entirely. The construction of Nord Stream and the abandonment of plans to diversify the Polish gas supply would put Poland and Ukraine entirely at Putin\u2019s mercy.\n\n\n\nIf Mr Tusk did indeed have an opinion of a Russophobe among other European politicians in Brussels, then it really tells us more about the state of mind of those politicians. If Poland\u2019s Deputy PM Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, who continues to maintain that Putin had his brother murdered, or Mr Donald Tusk, who completely dismissed the idea, are both Russophobes, then perhaps \u201cRussophobe\u201d is simply another word Brussels politicians use for \u201ca person from a country which had the misfortune to border Russia for centuries\u201d.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt\n\nGuy Verhofstadt is a liberal Flemish-Belgian politician, former Belgian MP, minister and Prime Minister, and currently an MEP and the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe faction in the European Parliament, in which position he has served since 2009.He is a strong advocate of a tighter European integration in the form of transforming the European Union into a federal entity, \u201cThe United States of Europe\u201d, which is also the title of a book he published in 2005.Back in 2002, following the shock of the 9/11 attacks, Mr Verhofstadt, who was then the Belgian PM, went even further. During a meeting of the Russia-NATO Council, which was meant to bring the alliance and Russia closer in terms of co-operating on global security, he said that:Any gains in those terms that Russia had made since the fall of communism have obviously been erased during the past 20 years of Putin\u2019s rule, and when it comes to global security, Russia has served as a destabilising factor. Not only when it invaded Georgia and now Ukraine, but also through its involvement in Mali and elsewhere.Mr Verhofstadt is one of those European politicians who have visited Ukraine in recent weeks and was abhorred by the evidence of atrocities perpetrated in places such as Borodyanka by the Russian invasion troops. To his credit, for the last several years he has been highly critical of European politicians who maintain a relationship with Russian politicians connected to the Kremlin. Justly so.The problem is that Mr Verhofstadt is linking anyone who disagrees with his liberal agenda, that is anyone who can be considered even remotely conservative, to Putin. For him, every conservative is just as bad as a dictator of a country that exercises practically full control of the media, imprisons or even murders political opponents, orders the invasion of neighbouring countries, and has his soldiers perpetrate genocide and other war crimes. Such a skewed perspective is not much different from accusing anyone with slightly different political views of being a re-incarnation of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, etc.And while it is true that several leaders of European conservative or right-wing movements have indeed fallen for the Kremlin peddled narrative portraying Putin\u2019s regime as one standing up to the \u201crotten, liberal West\u201d, even the current savage aggression perpetrated by Russia against Ukraine not quite making them rethink their attitude, some accusations are more hit-and-miss.\n\nFor example, Guy Verhofstadt has been an extremely vocal critic of the current Polish government. He was very critical of the \u201cWarsaw Summit\u201d, a conference of conservative and right- and centre-right-wing party leaders that occurred in Warsaw in December 2021, that was organised by the Polish ruling United Right coalition.\n\n\n\nIn a Tweet written in Polish, he referred to a very controversial comment made by Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French right-wing National Rally party. Her comment dated extremely poorly over the past several months, that is quite clear. But when Mr. Verhofstadt writes that \u201cOnly Putin and zero Europe\u2026 Law and Justice brings Poland closer to their national nightmare\u2026 in the name of blind party ambitions!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTylko Putin i zero Europy\u2026\n\n\n\nPiS przybli\u017ca Polsk\u0119 coraz bardziej do ich narodowego koszmaru\u2026 wszystko w imi\u0119 \u015blepych ambicji partyjnych ! https://t.co/h3JOAUKDnj \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) December 6, 2021\n\nWell\u2026 Ms Le Pen\u2019s comments, as already said, dated extremely poorly. The Hungarian PM, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, was also present at the summit, and his reluctance to give up cheap Russian crude oil and natural gas in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has met with harsh criticism from the Polish government, making the regional co-operation within the V4 group (made up of Poland, Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia) extremely hard.\n\n\n\nBut accusing the Polish conservatives of being Putin\u2019s supporters? People that believe that the Kremlin is responsible for the death of a Polish president from their own party?\n\n\n\nIt seems that according to Mr Verhofstadt\u2019s logic, the Polish government is some strange animal, in the vein of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat. It somehow manages to be anti-Russian and pro-Putin at the same time.\n\n\n\nAnd of course, any chance to lambast conservatives is a good one... So Guy Verhofstadt throws muck at conservative and right-wing politicians, and hopes something will stick. But he should be more careful when using photos of European politicians being chummy with Putin, because there are many European politicians that over the years have shaken Putin\u2019s hand. Including Mr Verhofstadt himself.\n\nWhen Europe is under threat, always remember:\n\n\n\nThose who talk about our sovereignty are always the first the sell it off ! pic.twitter.com/YqWxcPxqqH \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) February 22, 2022\n\nEmmanuel Macron\n\nCompared to other old hands listed so far, the President of the French Republic is relatively new to politics. His career only really began when he worked for one of the agencies of the Ministry of Finance in 2004 and served as an adviser to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande since 2006. But the only post he was ever elected to was that of the president, in 2017.Mr Macron\u2019s relationship with Putin is a complicated one. To his credit,He has also ordered airstrikes against Russian-backed Syrian government forces.His opinion on the subject may have evolved since then.he said in November 2019 in an interview given to The Independent. NATO Secretary-General and even Mr Macron\u2019s close ally, Chancellor Merkel, were shocked by the assessment, the latter even calling Macron\u2019s statement \u201cdrastic words\u201d. This was in contrast to the reaction of the Kremlin. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson called them \u201ctruthful words\u201d.And perhaps most controversially, he defended the selling of French-manufactured weapons to Russia, which occurred between 2014 and 2020, so after the illegal annexation of Crimea. While it is true that the decision was originally made by the Hollande administration, President Macron did not immediately put a stop to the arms trade.It seems that the ability to freely trade with Russia is very important to the French leader.The fact that many countries are not comfortable with Russia due to its aggressive policies appears to have eluded him. The fact that France, positioned on the other side of Europe and far away from Russia, may have been a contributing factor.Back in the day he said that the sanctions were inefficient, and that they \u201chave changed absolutely nothing in Russia \u2014 I am not proposing at all to lift them, I am just stating this.\u201d Well, that much has definitely proven true. The question is whether the correct course of action would not have been applying more sanctions, something that European countries were in the end forced to do, but it is happening only now, after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Macron has made numerous phone calls to Putin following the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian hostilities to a full-scale invasion. His frequent contacts with Putin and attempts at diplomacy have even invited mockery. Macron\u2019s attempts to broker peace have also been criticised by some politicians, including the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki who, when commenting on the French President for his efforts, asked whether he would also negotiate with Hitler. This prompted the French head of state to lash out against the Polish PM, not only accusing him of trying to interfere in French elections on behalf of Marine Le Pen, but also of being an antisemite and homophobe.\n\n\n\nAccording to President Macron, following the revelation of war crimes perpetrated on Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and its vicinity, he is no longer in direct contact with Vladimir Putin. He has also joined the calls for an embargo on Russian crude oil, although, notably, not on natural gas. But just as the call for an embargo on one strategic energy resource the sale of which is filling the Kremlin\u2019s coffers is blunted by the refusal to give up another one, he has been rather coy when it comes to calling a spade a spade.\n\n\u201cSo far, it has been established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and bring them to justice,\u201d Macron said during an interview given to France 2 television channel on April 13. As he said \u201cI am very careful with some terms [genocide] these days,\u201d he added. \u201cI'm not sure the escalation of words is helping the cause right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nFortunately for Mr Macron, who is running for re-election (the second round of the French presidential election will take place on April 24), his reluctance to call the genocide Russians are perpetrating against Ukrainians a genocide is still probably not as jarring as Ms Le Pen\u2019s statements about Crimea belonging within the Russian sphere of influence.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy\n\nsource: TVP World\n\nAnd finally, on a brief note, the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Sarkozy was one of the western leaders who helped negotiate a cease-fire during the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008 (officially: \u201cpeace enforcement\u201d). The Kremlin agreed to halt its invasion of its southern neighbour, once they have achieved their military goals, that is the conquest of South Ossetia. So perhaps giving Sarkozy too much credit for his role in the cessation of hostilities would be a bit of a stretch.But the issue is not Mr Sarkozy\u2019s role in brokering a cease-fire, but rather what followed.In a speech on April 3, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited Mr Sarkozy (as well as Angela Merkel) to visit Bucha, the site of the Russian-perpetrated massacre. He said that while he does not blame anyone except Russia for the aggression on Ukraine, he insisted the two former leaders \u201csee tortured Ukrainians with their own eyes\u201d, so that they can understand what the concession policy to Russia has led to 14 years later.",

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The Russians hadn\u2019t taken into account the railway saboteurs of Belarus. Starting in the earliest days of the invasion in February, a clandestine network of railway workers, hackers and dissident security forces went into action to disable or disrupt the railway links connecting Russia to Ukraine through Belarus, wreaking havoc on Russian supply lines.\n\nThe attacks have drawn little attention outside Belarus amid the drama of the Russian onslaught and the bloody aftermath of Russia\u2019s humiliating retreat. Fierce Ukrainian resistance and tactical errors by an ill-prepared Russian force were likely enough to thwart Russia\u2019s plans, analysts say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Belarus railway saboteurs can at least claim a role in fueling the logistical chaos that quickly engulfed the Russians, leaving troops stranded on the front lines without food, fuel and ammunition within days of the invasion.\n\nAlexander Kamyshin, head of Ukrainian railways, expressed Ukraine\u2019s gratitude to the Belarusian saboteurs. \u201cThey are brave and honest people who have helped us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe attacks were simple but effective, targeting the signal control cabinets essential to the functioning of the railways, members of the activist network said. For days on end, the movement of trains was paralyzed, forcing the Russians to attempt to resupply their troops by road and contributing to the snarl-up that stalled the infamous 40-mile military convoy north of Kyiv.\n\nHow much of the chaos can be attributed to the sabotage and how much to poor logistical planning by the Russians is hard to tell, especially as there is no independent media reporting from Belarus, said Emily Ferris, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. But without automated signaling, trains were forced to slow to a crawl and the number of them traveling on the tracks at any one time would have been severely restricted, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGiven the Russian reliance on trains, I\u2019m sure it contributed to some of the problems they had in the north. It would have slowed down their ability to move,\u201d she said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t push further into Ukrainian territory and snarled their supply lines because they had to rely on trucks.\u201d\n\nThe attacks also bought time for Ukrainian troops to formulate an effective response to the Russian invasion, said Yury Ravavoi, a Belarusian activist and trade unionist who escaped to Poland under threat of arrest during the anti-government protests that rocked Belarus in 2020.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say we were the most important factor, but we were an important brick in the wall,\u201d he said.\n\nThe saboteurs drew inspiration from an earlier episode in Belarusian history, during World War II, when Belarusians opposed to the Nazi occupation blew up railway lines and train stations to disrupt German supply lines. The Rail War, as it is known, is venerated as a moment of triumph for Belarus, taught in schools as the most successful of the tactics deployed by resistance fighters that eased the way for Soviet troops to drive the Germans out.\n\nThe battle for control over eastern and southern Ukrainian cities is the latest stage in this war, as Russia attempts to solidify its grip on the Black Sea. (Video: Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)\n\nEight decades later, it is Russia\u2019s presence in Belarus that has stirred dissent. The deployment of tens of thousands of Russian troops in Belarus in preparation for the invasion of Ukraine triggered widespread domestic opposition and rekindled opposition networks formed during the 2020 protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said Hanna Liubakova, a Belarusian journalist living in exile in Lithuania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis second Rail War has taken a more benign form than its predecessor. The partisans were keen not to inflict casualties, Ravavoi said. So they focused their attacks on damaging equipment to stop the railways from functioning.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to kill any Russian army or Belarusian train drivers. We used a peaceful way to stop them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe and other Belarusians involved in organizing the attacks decline to reveal precise details of how the attacks were carried out and by whom, citing the need for secrecy and concerns for the safety of the railway partisans, as the saboteurs are loosely known.\n\nThree main groups have been involved, representing railway workers, security force defectors and cyber specialists, said Lt. Col Alexander Azarov, a former security official living in Warsaw who heads the security force group called Bypol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRailway employees sympathetic to the partisans have leaked details of Russian movements and the locations of key railway infrastructure to a group called the Community of Railway Workers, which shares them on Telegram channels. Supporters on the ground link up to carry out the attacks, but there is no formal chain of command, Azarov said.\n\n\u201cOur movement is not centralized,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a leader of the resistance. It\u2019s horizontal, with dozens of groups working on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe third group, the Cyber Partisans, is formed of exiled Belarusian IT professionals who have carried out several cyberattacks on the Belarusian government since joining in 2020.\n\nThe Cyber Partisans launched the first attack, hacking into the railway\u2019s computer network in the days leading up to the invasion and snarling rail traffic before Russian troops had even crossed the border. Infiltrating the railway network\u2019s computers was relatively easy, said Yuliana Shemetovets, a spokesperson for the group who is based in New York, because the railway company is still using Windows XP, an outdated version of the software that contains many vulnerabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting on Feb. 26, two days after the invasion began, a succession of five sabotage attacks against signaling cabinets brought train traffic to an almost complete halt, said Sergey Voitekhovich, a former railway employee now based in Poland who is a leader in the Community of Railway Workers.\n\nBy Feb. 28, satellite photographs began to appear of the 40-mile convoy of Russian trucks and tanks ostensibly headed from Belarus toward Kyiv. Within a week, the convoy had completely stalled as vehicles ran out of fuel or broke down.\n\nThe Belarusian authorities have since launched an intense effort to prevent attacks and hunt down the saboteurs. The Interior Ministry has decreed that damaging railway infrastructure is an act of terrorism, a crime that carries a 20-year prison term.\n\nDozens of railway workers have been randomly detained and their phones searched for evidence that they were in touch with the partisans, the activists say. At least 11 Belarusians are in custody, accused of participating in the attacks, according to human rights groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early April, security police captured three alleged saboteurs near the town of Bobruisk and shot them in the knees. State television broadcast footage of the bleeding men, their knees bandaged, and claimed they had been shot while resisting arrest.\n\nThe shootings have had a chilling effect on the saboteur network, Azarov said. Belarusian troops are patrolling and drones have been deployed to monitor the railway lines. \u201cIt has become too dangerous to do attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nBut by the time of the police shooting, Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the area around Kyiv was in full swing and the Kremlin had announced it would refocus its military effort on capturing the east of Ukraine. The majority of the Russian troops that entered Ukraine from Belarus are now in the process of being redeployed to the east, the Pentagon says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe believe the fact that the Russians gave up on taking Kyiv is a result of our work because the Russians didn\u2019t feel as safe in Belarus as they had expected,\u201d said Franak Viacorka, spokesman for Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. \u201cThousands of Russian troops didn\u2019t receive food, they didn\u2019t receive fuel, and they didn\u2019t receive equipment on time.\u201d\n\nNow, a new phase in the rail war may be underway. In recent days the railway activists have posted on Telegram photographs of damage to signaling cabinets along Russian railway lines being used to transport troops into eastern Ukraine. The attacks can\u2019t be independently confirmed, but Voitekhovich claimed members of his railway network are involved. \u201cThere are open borders between Belarus and Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "4/24/2022\n\ntags: foreign policy\n\nDaniel Herman is Professor of American History at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington. He is the author of three monographs including Hell on the Range: A Story of Honor, Conscience, and the American West (2010) and the novel The Feudist (2020).\n\nUS Senator John McCain speaks to a pro-EU crowd in Kyiv, December 2013.\n\nThis past March, three esteemed colleagues at Central Washington University convened a teach-in to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine (they convened another one in April, which I didn\u2019t attend and so won\u2019t talk about). The presenters\u2014all experts in the fields of Russian history and culture\u2014gave bravura expositions exploring Russian nationalism, empire building, war, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. To my mind, however, something was missing: dissent.\n\nThough effective in its aims\u2014to teach history and generate support (including money) for Ukraine\u2014this particular teach-in differed profoundly from civil disobedience campaigns of the Vietnam era. Those who participated in the original anti-war teach-ins of the 1960s stood the risk of being ridiculed, bombed, spied on by FBI agents, and excoriated by community authorities and administrators. The CWU presenters, by contrast, buttressed rather than challenged a dominant narrative, given that 70% of Americans already view Russia as a threat. If the presenters are critical of hawkish U.S. foreign policy and the decades-long expansion of the military-industrial complex, not to mention the role of the U.S. in heightening tensions in Ukraine, they didn\u2019t say so.\n\nI find this particularly troubling at a time when 45% of Americans\u2014and 81% of Republicans\u2014view President Biden\u2019s actions viz. Ukraine as too cautious; 46% support a U.S.-imposed no-fly zone even when told it would risk nuclear war; and Congressional Democrats (Democrats!) seek to add billions more to the already record military budget that the administration requests.\n\nI\u2019m no expert on the history of Russia or Ukraine, but I am an avid consumer of news and I know quite a bit about U.S. history, including the history of U.S. wars and public opinion. In the spirit of scholarly debate\u2014and with respect and admiration for the presenters\u2014I take it upon myself to offer a dissenting view.\n\nHad I been among the presenters, I would have asserted that the overwhelming American support for Ukrainians in their fight against Russia\u2014though not without justice\u2014resembles earlier moments of American solidarity with European nations fighting authoritarianism, particularly 1917, when the U.S., reacting to German attacks and atrocities (but ignorant of British atrocities) joined the Entente Powers in what President Wilson called \u201ca war for democracy.\u201d Though the U.S. helped defeat autocratic Germany, the war spawned persecutions, authoritarianism, and jingoism at home (not least among Democrats, particularly intellectuals) and\u2014due to the terms of the Versailles Treaty\u2014fueled the rise of Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn that 1917 moment, like this one, a bellicose press\u2014with assistance from a bellicose government\u2014shut down dissent and marginalized dissenters. Randolph Bourne\u2019s justly famous essay condemning war fever seems every bit as apropos as it was in 1917.\n\nI do not doubt that Putin (rather like Germany\u2019s Kaiser) is a would-be imperialist who holds nostalgia for the Soviet Union and/or \u201cGreater Russia,\u201d and would like to recreate one or both, albeit without communism. The probability of that happening, however, seems exceedingly low. Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin had said that those who wish to recreate the Soviet Union \u201chave no brain\u201d and that his conventional military can in no way match that of NATO. More to the point, recreating the Soviet Union or Greater Russia would be enormously expensive and almost certainly impossible, no matter the outcome in Ukraine (part of why the Soviet Union dissolved was because the empire was more encumbrance than asset).\n\nMy own take is that the Western media\u2019s anti-Putin, pro-Ukraine, pro-NATO barrage has blinded both Americans and Europeans (especially the British, those hoary players of the \u201cGreat Game\u201d) to the fact that Putin, though capable of great brutality, is a rational actor. He is as likely to consolidate power due to the West\u2019s fervent response as to lose it. By making a diplomatic solution almost impossible (politicians need public support for any offer to lift sanctions as part of a peace package), the West\u2019s fervency might well protract the killing for years and destabilize Eastern Europe.\n\nLet me start my more detailed discussion by talking about NATO expansion. One of the teach-in presenters acknowledged that the U.S. and its European allies may have made a mistake by expanding NATO into nations that comprised the old Soviet Union but added that \u201cwoulda/couldas\u201d of past policymaking are beside the point. I disagree passionately. Revisiting \u201cwoulda/couldas\u201d is probably the only thing that can bring peace, at least any time in the near future.\n\nI have no particular expertise in foreign policy, but I defer to those who do (or did before their decease): George Kennan, the doyen of American Cold War policy; Paul Nitze, Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan; Paul Warnke, director of the Arms Control Association and SALT II negotiator; Richard Pipes, noted historian of the Soviet Union; Gary Hart, former Colorado Senator and co\u2011chair of the U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century; Jack Matlock, President Reagan\u2019s ambassador to the Soviet Union; Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State under Richard Nixon; William Perry, Secretary of Defense to Bill Clinton; and Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense under George Bush and Barack Obama. All of them\u2014and many others\u2014feared that NATO expansion into the former Soviet Union would lead to a renewed Cold War, if not a hot one.\n\nKennan\u2019s words are particularly apropos. The NATO expanders, he argued, had \u201clittle understanding of Russian history and Soviet history. Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then [the NATO expanders] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cI think it is the beginning of a new cold war \u2026 I think it is a tragic mistake.\u201d\n\nIn their zeal to punch Vladimir Putin, modern Democrats and their preferred media voices are quick to dismiss or diminish the assertion that the U.S. played a significant role in provoking the war (this isn\u2019t the Democratic Party of the 1970s or even the early 2000s; it\u2019s a party dedicated, or at least inured, to regime change policies, not just for Russia, but also Syria, Libya, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, Bolivia, and others to be announced). But yes, alas, the U.S. and NATO did much to provoke the war, and not just by expanding NATO. The U.S. also provoked the war with its own election meddling in Eastern Europe, especially in Ukraine, a meddling that was magnitudes\u2014light years\u2014greater than whatever Russia did or did not do in our 2016 election.\n\nSomething I have not seen reported in any mainstream venue is that as late as 2008, fully 50% of Ukrainians opposed NATO membership versus 24.3% who supported it. Another 2008 poll showed even greater opposition (56% against joining NATO versus 15% for). In a 2010 Gallup poll, 40% of Ukrainians viewed NATO as more threat than protector (just 17% said the opposite). What those poll numbers suggest is that the current situation resulted not from timeless Ukrainian fears of Russian aggression, but from blundering, arrogant neo-conservative Western foreign policy, along with equally blundering and over-aggressive Russian and Ukrainian policies since 2008.\n\nPolicy blunders, to be sure, weren\u2019t the only mover of opinion. Both the U.S. and EU offered powerful economic incentives. Quite simply, the EU and US are vastly wealthier than Russia and can offer enormous loans, bailouts, and investment capital. The fact that Russia has been Ukraine\u2019s main export partner, however, equalizes the equation to a degree.\n\nIf free market economics alone are driving Ukraine\u2019s movement toward the West, Russia should stand out of the way. The West, however, has not let the invisible hand do all the work. It also deploys another, more visible\u2014more problematic\u2014hand: the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), an agency created under President Reagan to perform tasks once under the purview of the CIA, including \u201cfostering \u2026 political parties, trade unions, free markets and business organizations.\u201d As idealistic and non-controversial as those goals sound, NED has a long history of promoting regime change; one observer calls it the National Endowment (for Meddling) in Democracy. In Ukraine, NED has poured tens of millions of dollars into building a pro-Western constituency. NED\u2019s European cousin, the European Endowment for the Democracy, has done the same on a smaller scale. They are assisted by the West\u2019s lavishly funded NGO complex, which (like NED) extended its reach across Eastern Europe. Total U.S. investment in Ukrainian \u201cgood governance\u201d and \u201cother goals,\u201d averred former Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland (now Undersecretary of State), amounted to $5 billion between 1991 and 2013.\n\nLet\u2019s step back a moment and imagine that Russia was an economic juggernaut able to spend $5 billion to turn Mexico into a close ally, modernize its army. Imagine, moreover, that Russia proposed to station troops\u2014along with anti-ballistic missiles\u2014in Mexico after bringing it into a defensive alliance (which is what NATO has done in nations formerly allied with Russia). Imagine, moreover, that Mexico was receptive to Russia\u2019s money\u2014and welcomed its meddling\u2014because it was poor and because some of its citizens, but not a majority, had lingering fears of U.S. hostility. Keep in mind that the U.S. has invaded Mexico twice, though not recently. That is precisely what the United States and its NATO allies have done in Ukraine.\n\nOne can certainly reply that Western meddling is necessary to counter Russian meddling. Russia clearly supports Ukrainian parties and leaders that favor its interests. No doubt it has brought tremendous pressure to bear on Ukrainian governments. I reiterate, however, that, as late as 2010, Ukrainians didn\u2019t want to join NATO. It was the West that had to lobby Ukrainians to gain support.\n\nThe NED/NGO complex is obviously not the only reason that Ukrainians have increasingly favored entering NATO and the EU. There is also the matter of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for the breakaway states in the Donbas (including sending a small number of troops), which occurred in reaction to Ukraine\u2019s Maidan revolution in 2014. The effect of Russia\u2019s decision was to strengthen Ukrainian nationalism and support for NATO, partly due to Russia\u2019s straightforward aggression, and partly because the withdrawal of Crimea and the Donbas greatly diminished Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian electorate.[1]\n\nGiven that Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea and Donbas created a predictable Ukrainian backlash, why did Russia take them? What we mostly hear from the cable press\u2014whether Fox, MSNBC, or CNN\u2014is that Putin\u2019s Russia is an imperialist, hateful, lying nation guided by the idea that might makes right. The Maidan revolution and its aftermath, however, is complex and ambiguous.\n\nTo understand that revolution\u2014or coup, by some accounts\u2014we have to go back to 2008, when George W. Bush, along with NATO, declared that Ukraine and Georgia would both become NATO members. Russia\u2014which had been warning against NATO expansion even before the first wave in 1999\u2014threatened war if that happened. From the Russian point of view, NATO wasn\u2019t an innocent, defensive alliance, but an aggressive, pro-Western alliance seeking to encircle them, isolate them economically, and, ultimately, strangle them militarily. In his speech justifying the Ukraine invasion, Putin discussed the threat of NATO encirclement in his first substantive paragraph and mentioned NATO nine more times. It is certainly possible that Putin invoked the NATO threat in an effort to disguise ulterior motives (e.g., recreating the Soviet Union), but to make that assumption is to overlook longstanding Russian fears.\n\nThe fact that NATO placed a \u201cdefensive\u201d shield of anti-ballistic missiles in former Warsaw Pact nations\u2014ostensibly to shoot down nuclear weapons launched by Iran\u2014was particularly anathema to Russia. From the Russian point of view, the West sought to give itself impunity to launch a nuclear attack without Russia being able to retaliate (since its missiles would be shot down). This would give the West so-called \u201cfirst-strike capability.\u201d The fact that the U.S. proceeded to withdraw from one arms-control treaty after another\u2014ABM, the INF, the Open Skies Treaty\u2014only intensified Russian fears (to be fair, the U.S. and NATO have accused Russians of any number of treaty violations; this is not simply a \u201cWest is malicious\u201d scenario, nor is it simply a \u201cRussia is malicious\u201d scenario).\n\nThe latter two treaty withdrawals, incidentally, were decisions by Putin\u2019s ostensible best friend, Donald Trump, who was also the first president to send \u201clethal aid\u201d (mostly meaning Javelin anti-tank missiles) to Ukraine, thus overturning Obama\u2019s decision not to do so for fear of worsening tensions and arming neo-Nazi \u201cthugs.\u201d Trump, too\u2014contrary to popular perceptions\u2014ramped up economic sanctions beyond Congressional mandates, causing Putin to believe that the West was waging economic war. Whether those sanctions were justified is a question I\u2019ll put aside for now; what is likely, however, is that they did more harm than good.\n\nWe can argue about whether Russian leaders are/were irrational to think that the West is out to get them, but it\u2019s unquestionably true that\u2019s what many of them thought and continue to think. Those fears led Russia to develop hypersonic nuclear-tipped missiles that the West thus far cannot defend against. They also led Russia to attack Georgia in 2008 in a five-day war initiated by Georgia\u2019s illegal attempt to reclaim a breakaway region called South Ossetia. This is a war that Russia\u2019s detractors cite as evidence that Putin is ruthless and seeks to recreate the Soviet Union. The actuality was a great deal more complex, and did not end with Russia annexing Georgia (though it continues to pose a military threat to Georgia).\n\nNor will Russia annex Ukraine, despite what we hear in the media. Its troops aren\u2019t positioned to capture the whole of Ukraine, much less occupy it. The objective seems to be to destroy Ukraine\u2019s military capabilities and to carve off a part of eastern Ukraine in order to attach Crimea to Russia by land and to better defend the Donbas. One would never know this from watching CNN, but, according to U.S. military and intelligence officials, Russian forces\u2014despite inflicting enormous carnage\u2014have been deliberately restrained in order to give room for diplomacy. The other objective seems to be precisely what Putin has stated: to ensure that Ukraine does not become a member of NATO. Nor am I willing to entirely discredit Putin\u2019s statement that he seeks to \u201cde-Nazify\u201d Ukraine (more on that later), given the Azov Battalion\u2019s role in attacks on the Donbas.\n\nStill, as my colleagues insist, this is Putin\u2019s war. He made an illegal decision to invade a sovereign nation. He and his supporters deserve whatever they get. Yes, but no, that\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nEven in the early 2000s, the NED/NGO complex had gone to work to turn Ukraine into a pro-Western nation. After NATO\u2019s decision in 2008 to encourage Ukraine\u2019s admission (I say \u201cencourage admission\u201d because, to reiterate, Ukrainians themselves opposed it), the fight for Ukrainian hearts and minds became more fraught, with pro-Western forces competing against Russophones to elect a favorable government. This was an inherently destabilizing situation.\n\nA turning point came in 2010, when Ukraine elected Viktor Yanukovych as president. Though considered pro-Russian, he strongly favored integrating Ukraine\u2019s economy with the European Union, partly by negotiating an EU economic bailout package. In 2013, however, he turned down the EU\u2019s offer because it required austerity measures that would shred Ukraine\u2019s social safety net and, arguably, because it contained strict anti-corruption requirements (Ukraine is awash in corruption). When Russia offered its own bailout deal sans austerity and anti-corruption measures and with guaranteed access to cheap natural gas, Yanukovych accepted, triggering his right-wing opponents to accuse him of making secret concessions (presumably involving control of Ukraine\u2019s gas pipelines).\n\nWhat often got lost in coverage of the ensuing protests was that Yanukovych\u2019s Russia deal protected industrial jobs in Ukraine\u2019s eastern \u201cRust Belt\u201d that might well disappear under the EU package. Nor did Western coverage give much attention to Russia\u2019s fears that cheap EU imports would undermine its fragile economy. Not surprisingly, the strongly pro-free enterprise NED/NGO complex went to work to undermine Yanukovych by working closely with the leaders of the Maidan revolution.\n\nThe U.S. and its NED/NGO apparatus did not create the Maidan phenomenon, to be sure, but did steer it to their own ends. Multiple U.S. officials\u2014including Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and Republican John McCain\u2014met with members of the far-right Svoboda party to affirm their support for Maidan. The equivalent would be Russian leaders meeting directly with, say, January 6 insurrectionaries. The staunchly neoconservative Assistant Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, moreover, called Geoffrey Pyatt, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine to instruct him about which Ukrainians the U.S. wanted in President Yanukovych\u2019s ministry and which ones the U.S. wanted excluded. Nuland in particular recommended Arseniy Yatsenyuk (\u201cYats is the guy who\u2019s got the economic experience,\u201d she says in the leaked audio of the call). After Maidan forces forced Yanukovych to flee the country (even after he had called new elections), Yatsenyuk became president. In a space of five months, Yatsenyuk nixed the Russia bailout deal, resuscitated the EU package (including austerity), and resigned.\n\nDid Maidan amount to a U.S.-endorsed coup? Was Nuland promoting Yatsenyuk for the role of president? We\u2019re told that the idea that the U.S. supported a coup in Ukraine is Russian disinformation, but are we sure? What precisely did Geoffrey Pyatt mean by \u201c[we need] somebody with an international personality to come out here and help to midwife this thing.\u201d Did Pyatt require a high-profile Western leader to visit Ukraine merely to endorse a ministerial shuffle? Or was the U.S. playing a bigger game? At the very least, the U.S. was meddling in Ukraine\u2019s politics to impose its will.\n\nIn supporting the Maidan project, the U.S. found a ready ally not just in the professorial accountant, Yatsenyuk, but also in Ukraine\u2019s energetic far-right, which provided shock troops\u2014militants\u2014in the protests in Kyiv and elsewhere. After those protests succeeded, the new government repealed a law allowing Russian as an official language in Eastern Ukraine, outlawed left-wing political parties (due to their sympathy with Russia) and outright banned and/or greatly curtailed books imported from Russia. Right-wing thugs meanwhile attacked left-wing political gatherings and drove them underground while the Ukrainian government looked the other way. NED\u2019s president, Carl Gershwin (prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to neo-con Jeanne Kirkpatrick of the Reagan administration) openly boasted that Maidan was a first step toward ousting Putin. This sort of statement fell short of optimal diplomacy, but was, and is, ubiquitous among Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment (aka, \u201cthe Blob\u201d).\n\nShortly after Maidan\u2014and the violence and repression that followed\u2014the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine passed referendums demanding (depending on how one translates) either to be fully independent or at least autonomous (the latter would be akin to creating Ukrainian federalism akin to that of the United States). There is little question that the referendums were replete with irregularities and coercion and lacked legitimacy under Ukrainian law. It\u2019s equally clear that much of the Donbas population\u2014with equal justification\u2014believed the Maidan government to be illegal (Yanukovych, after all, had prevailed in a fair election) and were infuriated by the Maidan government\u2019s attacks on separatists.\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, poured $2.5 billion into Ukraine\u2019s military seeking to modernize it, partly so it could recapture the breakaway states. The CIA began training Ukrainians to fight in the Donbas in 2015. Though it performed poorly in the early days, the Ukrainian army, along with right-wing paramilitary forces (there were 102,000 of them as of 2020), soon began inflicting agonies. In the war that followed, some 14,000 died between 2014 and 2022. According to the U.N., 81% of civilian casualties were in rebel-held areas between 2018 and 2021, a time when cease-fire agreements supposedly existed in accordance with Minsk protocols. To be sure, civilian casualties had diminished steeply from 2014-15, but cease-fire violations were numerous, and it was Ukrainian attackers who were mostly in violation.\n\nAn aside here on Ukrainian neo-Nazis who played roles in both the Maidan revolution and the fighting in the Donbas: There\u2019s a concerted effort afoot to paint them as selfless patriots who either never were genuine Nazis, or who have given up their ideology, or who represent but a tiny sliver of Ukraine\u2019s population. Examine reporting on those same right-wing zealots from before the Russian invasion and you\u2019ll find a different picture.\n\nIn 2020, Tim Lister of the U.S. Military Academy\u2019s Combating Terrorism Center had this to say: \u201cIn recent years, some Americans and Europeans drawn to various brands of far-right nationalism have looked to Ukraine as their field of dreams: a country with a well-established, trained, and equipped far-right militia\u2014the Azov Regiment\u2014that has been actively engaged in the conflict against Russian-backed separatists in Donbas. Most of these \u2018foreign fighters\u2019 appear to travel as individuals and at their own expense, according to the author\u2019s review of many cases, but there is a broader relationship between the Ukrainian far-right, and especially its political flagship the National Corps, and a variety of far-right groups and individuals in the United States and Europe.\u201d\n\nThough the U.S. theoretically bars arms shipments to Ukraine\u2019s right-wing militias, there is no way to know precisely where the massive influx of arms will go (just as there was no way to stop U.S. arms shipments from flowing to Al Nusra in Syria or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan). You can find more now pass\u00e9 and impolitic warnings about Ukraine\u2019s Nazis here, here, here, here, and here. Also, here, here, here, and here. And here, too. And here, here, here, and here. And here and here and here. The U.S. policy of flooding Ukraine with arms, in short, might well strengthen (and embolden) far-right constituencies throughout Eastern Europe, and possibly Western Europe.\n\nTo end the fighting, Ukraine, Russia, the Donbas states, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) hammered out the Minsk I and Minsk II accords in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Both created a path for the breakaway regions to gain autonomous status. The Ukrainian right, however\u2014which continued to pour fighters into the Donbas\u2014refused to honor the terms and the Ukrainian government did little to restrain them. Though President Zelensky demanded that right-wing militias leave the Donbas as a preliminary to making peace with Russia, he was met with adamant refusal as well as threats on his life. Since then, he has decided to work with the far-right. Ethnic Russians in the Donbas also violated the accords. Both sides, according to the U.N., abducted and tortured opponents, though the most gratuitous crime was committed by pro-Maidan forces that in 2014 set fire to a trade union building in Odessa, killing over 40 anti-Maidan protestors.\n\nSo, why did Putin and Russia wait to attack Ukraine until 2022, fully eight years after Russia annexed Crimea and the Donbas declared independence? Putin claims\u2014not without evidence\u2014that Ukraine was planning an offensive to reclaim Crimea and the Donbas. How did he know? Partly because President Zelensky had announced his intention to do so in 2021. Then\u2014in summer 2022, presumably\u2014Ukraine would join NATO as a full member. Zelensky announced that, too, in a tweet he later deleted (Zelensky, incidentally, asked the U.S. to say once and for all whether Ukraine would be allowed into NATO. He was told that no, probably not, but for appearances sake the answer was yes. Some observers suggest that the U.S., by leaving the door open, was deliberately luring Putin into war.) Once Ukraine joined NATO, Russia would have faced an Article 5 war against NATO to defend either the Donbas or its annexed territory in Crimea. Article 5 is the article in NATO\u2019s charter stipulating that a war against one member is a war against all, and that all will defend the one. Russia had zero prospect of winning such a war short of using nuclear weapons.\n\nThat alone, however, did not precipitate immediate attack. Putin massed forces on Ukraine\u2019s border in the hope of forcing Ukraine and the West to agree to Ukraine\u2019s neutrality (that is, a guarantee that Ukraine would not join NATO). He was also reacting to Ukraine\u2019s violation of the Minsk accords, including an increase in shelling and the use of weaponized drones. President Zelensky\u2019s stated willingness to pursue nuclear weapons undoubtedly figured in Putin\u2019s thinking, too.\n\nAccording to CIA sources, Putin\u2019s decision to attack Ukraine was made at the last minute, after his diplomatic overtures (which included direct talks with European leaders) failed. In other words, contrary to endless assertions in our media, the attack on Ukraine was not a long-planned decision meant to recreate the Soviet Union.\n\nIf Putin was correct\u2014if Ukraine intended to recapture Crimea and the Donbas, then promptly sign on with NATO\u2014his decision to invade was a preemptive strategy. That is not to say he lacked peaceful options. He could have recognized the Donbas states and stationed troops in them without embarking on a wholesale invasion. Alternately, he could have continued to seek support for the Minsk protocols, especially given that the Donbas holds limited economic and strategic importance to Russia and is an enormous drain on the Russian treasury. It is harder, however, to imagine Putin surrendering Russia\u2019s strategically important Black Sea naval base at Sevastopol (Crimea), which Ukraine would hand over to NATO. An apt analogy would be Cuba handing over the American base at Guantanamo to Russia. The U.S. would never allow it.\n\nWhatever his options, he declared a war. No doubt you have noticed, given that the U.S. media spent more time covering the Ukraine war in the last month than it spent in any previous month on any war in the past 31 years, including Iraq. Either a certain news-obsessed demographic of Americans is utterly fixated on the war, or the media really really wants Americans to care about it. Or both.\n\nThat observation becomes more interesting when one considers that, according to a Rasmussen poll, support for direct U.S. involvement correlates with income. The wealthier you are, the more likely you are to support U.S. involvement (at least in the hypothetical situation that the war escalates beyond Ukraine). Wealth tracks with whiteness and educational attainment, which, in turn, tracks with the mainstream media\u2019s main clientele: prosperous white Americans who grew up during the Cold War. Mind you, the mainstream media\u2019s coverage isn\u2019t falsified; it\u2019s simply credulous. It routinely reports faulty and/or speculative intelligence that the U.S. puts out for PR and strategic purposes, not to mention self-serving Ukrainian assertions that lack independent verification. That\u2019s not to say that mainstream coverage is always wrong; it\u2019s mostly just frenetic and fulsome. But don\u2019t even think about calling it propaganda.\n\nI find the situation frightening and deplorable. Frightening because any direct involvement by U.S. forces could escalate into nuclear war, starting with Russia\u2019s use of tactical nuclear weapons (which it has in abundance) to stop troop flows and arms shipments. Deplorable because the U.S. (and British) media have stoked an inferno of self-righteous rage, all in support of a country that has little strategic significance to the United States (or Britain).\n\nYes, I pity Ukrainians, who are being slaughtered by Russia\u2019s war machine. I hope the Ukrainians win without a prolonged bloodbath. But no, I do not believe that Ukraine\u2019s defeat would lead Russia to attack NATO or recreate the Soviet Union. As the scholar John Mearsheimer has noted, those are fables that Western policy elites tell themselves to deny their own culpability. Nor do I think that guaranteeing that Ukraine will remain neutral, rather than join NATO, will encourage China to think \u201caha, we can attack Taiwan and the U.S. will stay out of it!\u201d Such stories\u2014that diplomacy will make the U.S. \u201clook weak\u201d\u2014are endlessly recycled in every single conflict we enter, which is partly why we stayed in Vietnam and Afghanistan long after any conceivable progress was achievable.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re going to care about Ukraine, maybe we should also start caring about Yemen, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have died miserable deaths due to Saudi Arabia\u2019s attack on a sovereign nation, or about Syria, where our own occupying forces and proxies have displaced 7.1 million people and perpetuated a war that has cost more than 600,000 lives and untold misery (not least due to crippling Western sanctions that starve and impoverish millions), or about our own war crimes in Iraq, where our invasion led directly to the violent deaths of between 184,382 and 207,168 civilians (and hundreds of thousands more indirectly), or Libya, where NATO\u2019s regime change operation turned the most prosperous country in Africa into a fratricidal warlord state with open slave markets.\n\nOur press gives us wall-to-wall images of suffering in Ukraine, including images of bombed-out buildings and murdered civilians that attest to \u201cgenocide.\u201d If one wants to see equally convincing attestations to genocide, take a look at images of Fallujah, Iraq, where the U.S. and allied forces used white phosphorous and cluster bombs (and buried corpses, including some tied and shot, in mass graves) and destroyed 36,000 homes, 60 schools, and 65 mosques. Or, look at Mosul, Iraq, after the U.S. leveled it, with a nary a mention of civilian corpses. Or, Raqqa, Syria.\n\nRussia isn\u2019t the only nation that commits wartime atrocities.\n\nWhich brings us to the question: why does the West hate Putin so much? I have zero doubt that Putin is an autocrat who can be ruthless (as witnessed by the 1999 bombing of Grozny, which the West ambivalently condemned). Nor do I doubt that Russia, like the U.S., but on a smaller scale, meddles in other countries\u2019 elections for strategic purposes (though what Russia did in our 2016 election has been grossly overstated and misrepresented). I am inclined to think, too, though evidence isn\u2019t iron-clad, Putin has approved the assassinations of turncoat spies and journalists. All that is likely true. And yet the U.S. supports ally nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that are far more authoritarian than Putin\u2019s Russia. Nor is Ukraine itself innocent of human rights abuses, including torture, murder, and political repression. What, then, makes us hate Putin so much?\n\nThe answer is threefold. First, Russia\u2019s 2015 intervention in Syria on behalf of its longtime ally, Bashir Assad, ramped up tensions to new heights. The U.S.\u2014which was spending a billion dollars a year to arm supposedly \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d rightly condemned Assad and Russia for war crimes but had little or no interest in atrocities by their own proxies. Because the press focused on Syrian/Russian atrocities, moreover, the American public gained little understanding of Russian motives (namely, to protect their longtime military base in Syria and to prevent a Daesh-type government from replacing Assad).\n\nThen\u2014on the heels of Russian entry into the Syrian conflict\u2014came the Russiagate furor, which was repeatedly distorted and exaggerated by venues like MSNBC, CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, for whom Russiagate was a financial windfall. Amid the blizzard of hyperbolic punditry, 67% of Democrats came to believe that Russia had actually changed vote totals in the 2016 presidential election. The impeachment sagas of 2018 and 2020 more firmly linked Russiagate to the cause of Ukrainians whom Trump stood accused of endangering. The U.S. must arm Ukrainians in their fight against Russia, intoned impeachment lawyer Pamela Karlin, so that \u201cwe don't have to fight them here\u201d (even as the Minsk Accords, in theory, remained in effect). Any number of Congressional Democrats joined her chorus of Red Dawn-style hyperbole.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile\u2014despite their anger over the false Russiagate charges\u2014never really abandoned their Cold War mentality. After Russia invaded Ukraine, they were more than happy to resurrect Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 contention that Russia remained our country\u2019s greatest nemesis. It wasn\u2019t, but the ubiquity of Russophobia among foreign policy elites made his statement self-fulfilling. Lindsay Graham and John McCain\u2014long the GOP\u2019s and most eager and strident hawks\u2014personally advanced Romney\u2019s Cold War narrative by visiting Ukraine in 2017, where they promised to help Ukrainian troops prosecute their war against separatists. When Russia launched its invasion, the GOP finally had its 1980s foreign policy back.\n\nWhat all this leads up to is simply this: if Americans who fly Ukrainian flags actually want to help Ukrainians, they would be well advised to support diplomatic negotiations rather than limitless flows of weaponry. It is highly unlikely that Putin will withdraw without a negotiated settlement that would include a promise that Ukraine will not join NATO, as well as some guarantee that the Ukraine will recognize Crimea as part of Russia and grant autonomy to the Donbas. What Russia might provide, in return, would be war reparations (couched as \u201ceconomic aid\u201d) and recognition of Kosovo.

            "text": "Two months on from the start of the war, Russia seems no closer to achieving its original aims. Even if taken at face value, the recent announcement that the goal is now the capture of Donbas and southern Ukrainian territory, creating a land bridge from Crimea, is a dramatic climbdown from the original goals of conquering the whole country, effecting regime change, and forcing Nato to retreat to the force posture of the mid-1990s.\n\nRevising goals downward so early in a war of choice is, of course, a sign that the Kremlin thinks things are going badly. And there is every reason to think that things are going to get significantly worse for Putin.\n\nFrom the start of the war, western analysis has highlighted the Russian army\u2019s apparent problems with logistics, communication, equipment, training and morale. All of these are issues that could in theory be fixed, greatly improving Russia\u2019s capacity to fight the war. But there are two immediate problems with this. The first is the impact of sanctions, which will continue to put pressure on Russian finances, ultimately limiting the Kremlin\u2019s capacity to spend its way out of the difficulty. Sanctions also pose a challenge to attempts to resupply and repair\u2014let alone upgrade\u2014equipment, because they cover military and technology sales.\n\nThe second problem is time. Russian personnel and equipment losses have been enormous. Repairing and building new vehicles, planes and helicopters is a slow process, and it takes many years to replace lost warships. It also takes time to adequately train soldiers to replace the many thousands killed and wounded. Russia appears to be losing men and weapons more quickly than it can replace them; unless this changes, it spells defeat.\n\nBut even if the Kremlin were able to overcome these problems, there are two further, fundamental challenges concerning the conduct of the war and its aims that are entirely outside its control. These mean Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine will continue to fail.\n\nThe first is that the west seems committed to supplying Ukraine with military assistance for the foreseeable future. The scale of this aid is staggering. The United States alone has provided or pledged $3.4bn in military assistance since the start of the war, including $1.6bn in the last two weeks alone; the top ten countries providing military aid have collectively pledged nearly $6bn. It is impossible for Russia to compete with this.\n\nBeyond the headline figures, the specifics of western aid should also be deeply worrying for the Kremlin. The most obvious problem for Putin is that aid is seemingly being tailored to address the changing character of the war. The UK government, for example, has announced that it will \u201cbackfill\u201d Polish tank capacity, supplying Poland with tanks that will enable the country to supply its own tanks to Ukraine. Like the recent announcement that the US will provide armoured personnel carriers and howitzers, this seems designed to help Ukraine in the fight for its eastern territory.\n\nEarly in the war, concerns about the risk of escalation appeared to be limiting the types of western aid provided to Ukraine. The Kremlin attempted to increase this anxiety, and so choke off the aid supply, by announcing that western supply convoys would be regarded as legitimate targets and by making ominous, if vague, noises about nuclear weapons. The latest round of pledges from western donors suggests that these threats may be causing less concern than previously, or that that they carry less weight because the will to support Ukraine has strengthened. Either is very bad news for Putin, since this was almost the only lever that he could pull to try to slow or stop aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe public acknowledgement by western leaders that the war could last for years is an important signal that they are not shaping policy in expectation of a quick resolution; they are preparing their populations for a long-term commitment to Ukraine. Any hopes that Putin may have pinned on nervousness about this would seem to be misplaced.\n\nThis means that Russia, with its capacity to wage war significantly degraded by the first two months of fighting and with limited (and declining) scope to reverse its losses, will have to deal with an opponent benefitting from a seemingly open-ended supply of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of weapons. That is not sustainable.\n\nThere is a second fundamental issue that Putin is unable to control. In aiming to weaken the west and turn the European strategic clock back, he has triggered the opposite outcome. Although differences inevitably remain, western states look much more united than they have at any point this century, and much more focused on strengthening military capacity in the face of Russian threats. It now looks possible that despite their long histories of neutrality, Finland and Sweden will join Nato. This would be a strategic disaster and a profound humiliation for Russia. Threats intended to prevent their accession seem to be having the reverse effect. Whatever short-term gains the Russian army may make by reducing cities like Mariupol to ruins, the medium- and long-term prospects look disastrous for Putin, and he appears powerless to do anything about it.",

            "text": "Russia-Ukraine War: Is The World Witnessing Another \u2018Cold War\u2019 Era?\n\nBy Mukhtar Ya\u2019u Madobi\n\nOf course, it was true, which is hard to believe. We have been hearing about the first and second world wars and how they were fought, because we never had a chance to witness any of them. Nevertheless, in what appears to be akin to a recipe for the third world war, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin had in Late February authorized a \u2018special military operation\u2019 against the neighboring country, Ukraine. This is to press home his demands about Russia\u2019s refusal to allow Ukraine join the United States and European military alliance, known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.\n\nThe Russian forces have so far invaded the country, seized many cities, strategic institutions and facilities that are very crucial to Ukraine as a corporate nation. Alas, a lot of people have been killed, wounded while a host of others were sent packing as refugees around the border of neighboring countries. The situation has really led to a critical emergency response as the UN stated that more than 3million Ukrainians have currently plunged into deep humanitarian crises and are in dire need of assistance.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the war, the Russian Federation had for months stationed a large number of troops around the Ukraine border as a precautionary measure for any attempt by the NATO forces to establish their presence in Ukraine. A lot of efforts have been made through mediation by international organizations to avert this unfortunate experience, but no light was found at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThis is due to the obsession of the Ukraine President, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky obsession to join forces with NATO as well as the latter\u2019s long term ambition to also expand their geographical reach downward the eastern Europe so as to establish proximity to Russia by creating a military base in an ally country, specifically the presently war-torn Ukraine.\n\nA lot of pundits, which I shared the same view with, argued that Zelensky was thoughtless to have engaged his country into war with Russia, a fight which he knows clearly that he never stood a chance of winning due to superior military spirits of Russia. Because, the Russian military forces put at 1,014,000 with reserve forces of 2,000,000 are five times greater than Ukrainian military forces of 200,000 and reservists of 500,000. Thus, it is obvious that the latter is no match for the former.\n\nEven though I wasn\u2019t born, from what I have read in history, the present Ukrainian situation is just a replica of the olden days \u2018cold war\u2019 between the two world \u2018super powers\u2019 i.e. the defunct Soviet Union (presently Russia) and the United State of America. It is obvious that they are now fighting a proxy war thereby using Ukraine as a battle ground to flex their muscles and showcase their military prowess.\n\nLet me flash our memories a little back to the era of cold war for the purpose of adequate comprehension of this article.\n\nAfter the Second World War ended with the defeat of Germany, Japan and Italy in the hands of the alliance comprising mainly Great Britain, Soviet Russia and the USA. The United States with its economic wealth and military strength, no doubt, made a matchless contribution to the victory in the War and it was felt that its strengths and leadership would be needed to maintain peace in the post-War world, too. Having contributed significantly to the victory in the war, Soviet Russia was not to be sidelined; the country claimed equal say in deciding on European problems.\n\nNevertheless, not so long after this gentlemen\u2019s agreement, the US and the Soviet Union developed differences about working together for the peace and stability of Europe. There were political and ideological reasons for these differences. The US practiced and preached \u2018democracy\u2019 and \u2018free market\u2019 enterprise as the desirable model of governance, while the Soviet Union believed and practiced governance by a single (communist) party and of state-controlled economy.\n\nThese differences led to feelings of one being threatened by the other. So began the bipolar phase in the world order immediately after the War. The United States and the Soviet Union stood out as two opposite poles around which, to begin with, European politics revolved. While the countries of Western Europe joined hands with the US and called themselves the \u201cFree World\u201d, countries of Eastern Europe became part of the Socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. These two leading countries of rival camps were clubbed under the exclusive, new category of \u201csuper powers\u201d.\n\nRelations between East and West were never cordial. Short of going to war directly, the two camps indulged constantly in political and military competition. This state of affairs was widely called the \u201cCold War\u201d. The Cold War was marked by a great deal of competition in forming military alliances, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO).\n\nNATO was formed in 1949 with the United States, Canada and 10 countries in Western Europe including Belgium, Britain, Netherlands, West Germany, France etc. The Soviet Union then cleverly offered to join the alliance, but NATO turned down the offer because NATO\u2019s real purpose was to stop the spread of the Soviet influence and ideology.\n\nAs a result, the Soviet Union set up in 1955 its own military grouping, the WTO with its allies in Eastern Europe to counter NATO. The original members are; Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania.\n\nHowever, the Soviet Union broke up into the Russian Federation and 14 other Republics in 1991 and the WTO was equally disbanded. All these new states abandoned socialism and embraced Western ideology of \u2018democracy\u2019 and \u2018free market economy\u2019. For example, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland joined NATO on March 12 March 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia joined in March 2004 and Albania joined on 1 April 2009.\n\nIt was regarded as a grand victory for the US as it has recorded victory in the Cold War and it became an object of both admiration and fear. The US became the single remaining super power with the fall of socialism and breakup of the Soviet Union\n\nSo going back to our previous discussion, it is obviously simple to understand why Russia invaded Ukraine all of sudden. It is apparent that NATO-US would have the right to establish a military base in Ukraine soil immediately when it joins the alliance. And this gives them proximity to Russia, which is one of the vicious thorns in their flesh.\n\nIt can be recalled that the US invaded Cuba in 1961 because the Soviet wanted to build a military base in that country. Cuba is a few miles away from the US and the latter felt threatened by the Russian presence back then. So why should NATO and the US now build a military base in Ukraine which is also a few miles away from Moscow, the capital city of Russia? Putin is not stupid. He clearly knows that the moment NATO/US enters Ukraine and establishes a military base, then Russia is vulnerable to attack anytime.\n\nAdditionally, NATO and US breached the 1990 treaty which prevented NATO and US from expanding eastwards of Europe from the then East Germany. As of today, NATO establishes its presence almost everywhere in eastern Europe including Croatia, Poland and other places that are closer to Russia. Thus, getting closer to Russia means NATO and US missiles can strike Moscow very quickly without wasting time.\n\nOver the years, as a result of their vested interests, US-NATO forces have been playing a vital role in creating tensions among various countries in the world. Recall that in 2011, NATO and French forces ransacked Libya and killed Colonel Muammar Ghaddafi of blessed memory. Libya that used to be a prosperous nation has now reduced to a poverty and war-ravaged country in Africa.\n\nAlso, US single-handedly invaded Iraq in 1990, bombed the country and also killed Saddam Hussein, the President. America claimed to have acted on \u2018credible intelligence\u2019 which turned out to be false, saying that Iraq had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction and up to now, none of such was found. Today Iraq lies in ruins with no sober government.\n\nAdditionally, they also pounded on Syria and nearly overthrew its President, Bashar Al-Asaad if not because of Russia\u2019s intervention. For over decade, Syria has been shattered and turned to safe haven, swarmed by criminal elements including terrorists.\n\nAs of today, Afghanistan that used to be a peaceful nation has now become stateless after so many years of war occasioned by the presence of the US after the Russians have left. Today Afghanistan is a total mess.\n\nAs it stands now, US and NATO have started sending military logistics to allied nations which will apparently sneak their way into Ukraine. This is dangerous and it might prove the assertion by Russia that NATO and US wants to enter Ukraine so that it can launch attacks on Russian soil.\n\nBelieve me, when this happens, those staunch allies to Russia including China, India, Syria, Iran, the defiant boy of North Korea and others will surely waste no time in coming to its aid. In fact, North Korea has already started testing ballistic missiles and would be ready to shell her close rival and US ally, South Korea at the glimpse of an opportunity.\n\nSo, is the Third World War knocking on our doors?\n\nHonestly, US and NATO unwarranted activities should be checked, if not, they might wake up one day and decide to replace the government of any country they deem fit with another.\n\nMeanwhile NATO and US should cast aside their greediness of expanding eastward of Europe, especially toward Russia as a mark of respect for the treaty they signed earlier on that regard.\n\nTo the inexperienced Zelensky of Ukraine, who allowed himself to be brainwashed by turning his country into a battlefield for NATO/US and Russian forces, the earlier he shelves his interest in joining that military alliance, the better for him and his country as he never stands a chance of emerging victorious against Russia.\n\nBecause, none of NATO/US forces will engage in direct physical confrontations with fully nuclear missiles armed Russia as a result of the known consequences that might accompany such recklessness.",

            "text": "Placeholder while article actions load\n\nThe United Nations secretary general called this week for an Easter truce between Russia and Ukraine. Orthodox Christians in both countries observe Easter on Sunday. But as the fighting continued to rage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow on Thursday of rejecting the U.N. proposal. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Russia\u2019s invasion has roiled global markets, revived the NATO alliance and triggered war crimes investigations. It has also opened a rift in the Orthodox Church, pitting the Russian wing and its pro-Kremlin patriarch against Orthodox leaders in Kyiv and around the globe.\n\nOrthodox Christianity is one of the largest Christian communions in the world \u2014 after Catholicism and the Protestant church. Most of its roughly 260 million adherents are concentrated in Europe, Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union.\n\nDespite the ongoing Russian invasion of their country, Ukrainians celebrated Orthodox Easter on April 24. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nIt is the dominant faith in both Russia and Ukraine, where the status of the church has become a source of tension between Moscow and Kyiv. For Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally in the church, Patriarch Kirill, Ukraine is an inseparable part of a greater Russian world \u2014 one with Moscow as its political center and Kyiv as its spiritual hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this, Kirill, 75, has offered a full-throated endorsement of the war, doubling down even as the world recoils at widespread reports of Russian atrocities in Ukraine. His pro-war stance has angered other church leaders, in Ukraine and across the Orthodox faith, many of whom have condemned the war and urged Kirill to reconsider his support.\n\nAs the Orthodox world celebrates its Easter holiday Sunday, here\u2019s how the tensions within the church are playing out:\n\nRussian Orthodox Church\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is one of the largest and most influential in the world, with more than 100 million followers, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2009, Kirill was elected patriarch \u2014 the first since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nAt first, Kirill was seen as a modernizer who might carve out some independence for the church, after his predecessor, Alexiy II, used his political ties to raise the church\u2019s profile after decades of atheist communism. Russian politicians bankrolled the construction of new churches, and religious leaders appeared front and center at state functions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, however, Kirill has solidified his role as an ally of the Kremlin, helping Putin cloak his political and military ambitions in the language of faith.\n\nOn Feb. 23, one day before the invasion, Kirill released a statement praising Putin for his \u201chigh and responsible service to the people of Russia\u201d and describing mandatory military service as \u201can active manifestation of evangelical love for neighbors.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since the war started, Kirill has used his sermons to justify the campaign, portraying it as a struggle against sinful Western culture \u2014 although he is careful to avoid referring to the conflict as a war or invasion that was launched by Russia.\n\nHe has focused almost entirely on what he calls Ukraine\u2019s \u201cextermination\u201d of pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region in the eastern part of the country. Earlier this month, Kirill delivered a sermon urging Russians to rally around the government \u201cduring this difficult time,\u201d the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet the Lord help us unite during this difficult time for our Fatherland, including around the authorities,\u201d the Interfax news agency quoted Kirill as saying at a sermon in Moscow.\n\nUkrainian Orthodox Church \u2014 Moscow Patriarchate\n\nThe vast majority of Ukrainians identify as Orthodox Christian, according to Pew. Their loyalties, however, are split between at least two major ecclesiastical bodies, one being the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is \u201cself-governing\u201d but remains under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nFor centuries, churches in Ukraine and Russia were both under the leadership of the Moscow patriarch. However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the church in Ukraine pressed for \u2014 and obtained \u2014 semiautonomous status in 1990.\n\nBut in recent years, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine, an increasing number of Ukrainian followers have sought to counter what they see as Moscow\u2019s influence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the invasion, those calls have intensified \u2014 and parishioners have grown angry over the Russian Orthodox Church\u2019s support for the war. All of this has put the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its leader, Metropolitan Onuphury, in a precarious position, particularly as reports of civilian massacres and other atrocities mount.\n\nOn Feb. 24, the day of the invasion, Onuphury released a statement calling the military campaign a \u201cdisaster\u201d and appealing to Putin to \u201cimmediately stop the fratricidal war.\u201d\n\nThe war between Russians and Ukrainians \u201cis a repetition of the sin of Cain, who killed his own brother out of envy,\u201d Onuphury said. \u201cSuch a war has no justification either from God or from people.\u201d\n\nThe church has emphasized its role in providing assistance to civilians and presiding over the burial of Ukrainian service members. Some priests have stopped commemorating Kirill in their services or have called on Onuphury to break away from Moscow entirely.\n\nOrthodox Church of Ukraine\n\nThe Orthodox Church of Ukraine is three years old. Its founding was the direct result of the burgeoning movement to peel away from the Russian Orthodox Church and create a purely independent ecclesiastical entity for Ukraine. The church\u2019s recognition by the patriarchate in Turkey angered Moscow, and the Russian Orthodox Church severed its ties with that body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leader of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine is Metropolitan Epiphanius, 43, who has been vocal in his criticism of Putin and the war. Soon after the invasion, Epiphanius released a statement likening the Russian leader to both the Antichrist and Adolf Hitler.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of the Antichrist operates in the leader of Russia, the signs of which the Scriptures reveal to us: pride, devotion to evil, ruthlessness, false religiosity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was Hitler during World War II. This is what Putin has become today.\u201d\n\nThis week, after he visited the devastated city of Chernihiv, Epiphanius urged Ukrainians to continue to fight the Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cSeeing the suffering, destruction, brutal violence and spread of death that Russia brings to every corner of Ukraine ... we understand even better that only the fight against the aggressor [and] his expulsion from our land can bring us a just peace,\u201d he said.\n\nEcumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is one of the world\u2019s oldest institutions. The Orthodox Church has no single leader, but Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is considered its spiritual guide and \u201cfirst among equals\u201d with the other patriarchs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBartholomew has been critical of Moscow and the war, and of Kirill and the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nOn the first day of the invasion, he condemned what he said was an \u201cunprovoked attack by Russia against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nLater, in an interview with CNN Turk, he defended his decision to grant autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and warned that Russia\u2019s aggression and isolation could lead to a \u201cnew Cold War.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole world is against Russia,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cThe distance between Russia and the Western world is getting bigger. It means that we are entering a new Cold War period.\u201d\n\nThe patriarchate has delivered humanitarian aid to the church in Kyiv. On a visit to Poland in late March, Bartholomew denounced the invasion as an \u201catrocious\u201d act.\n\n\u201cIt is simply impossible to imagine how much devastation this atrocious invasion has caused for the Ukrainian people and the entire world,\u201d Bartholomew said at a news briefing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe added that solidarity with Ukrainians \u201cis the only thing that can overcome evil and darkness in the world.\u201d\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "By Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA)\n\nBy Bipandeep Sharma*\n\nThe Arctic region witnessed extensive militarisation during the Second World War. In the Cold War period, despite military exercises conducted by rival blocks\u2014the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact countries\u2014the Arctic remained stable without any confrontation. In fact, the 196-km border between the Soviet Union and Norway (the only NATO-member country to share a border with the Soviet Union) remained peaceful throughout the Cold War. In 1987, with the Cold War in its end-phase, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in his famous \u2018Murmansk Speech\u2019, called for the Arctic as a \u2018Zone of Peace\u2019 and emphasised the need for cooperation in the region. 1\n\nGorbachev\u2019s vision was reciprocated by the West. The first environmental cooperative initiative, called the \u2018Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy\u2019 (AEPS), was signed by eight Arctic states in 1991.2 AEPS was the initiative of government of Finland that resulted in successful conclusion of various cooperative measures to protect the Arctic environment. 3 These eight Arctic states in 1996 signed the Ottawa Declaration which led to the establishment of the Arctic Council.4 Since its formation, the Arctic Council has become an important forum for addressing issues of environment, sustainable development and purveying the socio-economic context in the region.5 The Arctic Council is the most important intergovernmental forum for cooperation between the Arctic states in the high north. The working of the Arctic Council is executed through its six working groups and the decision making within the Council is based on \u2018consensus basis\u2019.\n\nIn February 2022, as a result of Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine, the seven Western Arctic states (A7), 6 five of which are members of NATO,7 have issued a joint statement to \u2018temporarily pause\u2019 their participation in all meetings of the Council and its subsidiary bodies.8 These states argued that the Arctic Council works on the fundamental rules of international law, and Russia, which currently holds the chairmanship of the Arctic Council, has violated it. While describing the action as \u2018regrettable\u2019, Russia, in response, highlighted that the Arctic Council has remained depoliticised, despite the past geopolitical issues.9\n\nThe A7\u2019s decision could have serious implications for the Arctic. First, all the eight Arctic states are at close geographical proximity to one another. Even a temporary suspension of the Arctic Council could challenge its established credibility and decision making. This could enhance geopolitical competition by superseding the existing scientific cooperation, consensus on environmental concerns and other mutually agreed solidarities between the states in the region.\n\nSecond, the Arctic contains multiple existing issues of territorial sovereignty, resource exploitation and disagreements over national/international shipping routes. Suspending the working of the Arctic Council would terminate the existing cooperation, resulting in unwanted strategic competition in the region. Furthermore, in order to protect their own self-interests in the Arctic, a potential military build-up can be expected.\n\nThird, Russia holds the largest territorial and coastal extent in the Arctic. It remains the only state with strong Arctic infrastructure and military capabilities. The Russian Arctic accounts for almost half of the total Arctic population living in the region.10 If the current situation prevails or the A7 countries consider forming any new alliance or forum without Russia, it would polarise the Arctic region, which could lead to dangerous outcomes. Similarly, any such alternative approach/alliance by Russia with non-Arctic states, would further challenge the existing cooperation in the region.11\n\nFourth, the issue of climate change is serious in the Arctic, where the global warming is occurring at thrice the average normal. Suspension of all established cooperation with Russia through Arctic Council, would seriously affect academic and scientific engagements between states on climate research in the region.\n\nFifth, the Arctic Council has become successful in negotiating three important legally binding agreements in the region. These include \u2018Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation\u2019,12\u2018Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response\u2019,13 and the \u2018Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic\u2019.14 Also, all the Arctic states have successfully concluded an \u2018International Agreement on Prevention of Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean\u2019.15 As a counter measure to A7\u2019s decision on the Arctic Council, Russia may consider withdrawing from these important agreements in the Arctic, which would further lead to greater insecurities in the region.\n\nSixth, apart from the Arctic permanent states, there are 13 non-Arctic observer states in the Arctic Council.16 Though these states remain outside the decision-making process of the Council, they are actively engaged in the various working groups of the Council. Asian observers such as India, China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea face vulnerabilities as a result of climate change in the Arctic. A pause in the Working Groups of the Arctic Council will have significant implications for the ongoing and future projects undertaken by these states.\n\nFinally, the ongoing debate within the Finish and the Swedish parliaments to join NATO membership will make the revival of the Arctic Council difficult, if not impossible. As and when these two Arctic Council members join NATO, it will have significant geopolitical repercussions for the region. Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, has already warned of Russia\u2019s nuclear and hypersonic deployments, if Finland and Sweden secured NATO membership.17\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Arctic Council, till recently, has proved itself to be a successful model of cooperation. Security issues were consciously kept away from the charter of the Arctic Council. The heightened political contestations in the wake of Russia\u2013Ukraine war could radically alter the spirit as well as structure of the Council. With Finland and Sweden seeking membership of NATO, the situation in the region will, in all likelihood, aggravate further. How the Arctic Council responds to these developments and whether it will remould itself is a moot question.\n\nViews expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Manohar Parrrikar IDSA or of the Government of India.\n\n*About the author: Bipandeep Sharma is a Research Analyst at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.\n\nSource: This article was published by Manohar Parrrikar IDSA",

            "text": "KYIV: Russian forces tried to storm a steel plant sheltering soldiers and civilians in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol , and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he would meet Sunday in his nation's capital with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Zelenskyy in a news conference gave few details about the logistics of his upcoming encounter with Blinken and Austin but said he expected results \u2014 \u201cnot just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons.\u201dIt would be the first high-level US trip to Kyiv since before the war began on Feb. 24.While visiting Poland in March, Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil to meet with the country's foreign minister.Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a US leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris.Russia's effort in Mariupol is aimed at crushing the last pocket of resistance in the city, a place of deep symbolic and strategic value to Moscow. Completing its capture would give Russia its biggest victory yet, after a nearly two-month siege reduced much of the city to a smoking ruin.In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces also pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine A 3-month-old baby girl was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, officials said. Zelenskyy said 18 more were wounded. The Ukrainian news agency UNIAN said the baby's mother, Valeria Glodan, and grandmother also were killed, citing social media posts from the baby's father and others.\u201cThe war started when this baby was 1 month old. Can you imagine what is happening?\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThey are just bastards. ... I don't have any other words for it, just bastards.\u201dThe Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.The command post was hit on Friday, killing two generals and critically wounding another, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency said in a statement. The Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.The fate of the Ukrainians in the sprawling and besieged seaside steel mill in Mariupol, where Russia says its forces have taken the rest of the city, wasn't immediately clear.A Ukrainian military unit on Saturday released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun.\u201cWe want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,\u201d one woman in the video said. \u201cYou have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness.\u201dRussia said it took control of several villages elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region and destroyed 11 Ukrainian military targets overnight, including three artillery warehouses. Russian attacks also struck populated areas.Associated Press journalists observed shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city; regional Gov. Oleh Sinehubov said three people were killed.In the Luhansk area of the Donbas, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six people died during the shelling of a village, Gorskoi.In Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas, the AP witnessed two soldiers arriving at a hospital, one of them mortally wounded.Sitting in a wheelchair outside her damaged Sloviansk apartment, Anna Direnskaya, 70, said, \u201cI want peace.\u201dOne of many native Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, Direnskaya said she wishes Russians would understand that Ukrainians are not bad people and that there should be no enmity between them.\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d she said. \u201cI don't know.\u201dBritish officials said Russian forces had not gained significant new ground, but Ukrainian officials announced a nationwide curfew ahead of Easter Sunday, a sign of the war's disruption and threat to the entire country.Mariupol has been a key Russian objective and has taken on outsize importance in the war.It would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014. Russia-backed separatists control parts of the Donbas.An adviser to Ukraine's presidential office, Oleksiy Arestovych, said Russian forces resumed airstrikes on the Azovstal plant and were also trying to storm it, in an apparent reversal of tactics. Two days earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin had given an order not to send troops in but instead to blockade the plant.Ukrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops along with civilians are taking refuge in its tunnels.Earlier Saturday the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the plant, released the video of around two dozen women and children. Its contents could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians trapped underground there.The video shows soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl says she and her relatives \u201chaven't seen neither the sky nor the sun\u201d since they left home Feb. 27.The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told the AP the video was shot Thursday.The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed by far-right activists in 2014 at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and has elicited criticism for some of its tactics.More than 100,000 people \u2014 down from a prewar population of about 430,000 \u2014 are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city.Yet another attempt to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol failed Saturday. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organised buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 227 kilometres to the northwest.\u201cAt 11 o'clock, at least 200 Mariupol residents gathered near the Port City shopping centre, waiting for evacuation,\u201d Andryushchenko posted on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cThe Russian military drove up to the Mariupol residents and ordered them to disperse, because now there will be shelling.\u201dAt the same time, he said, Russian buses assembled about 200 metres (yards) away.Residents who boarded those were told they were being taken to separatist-occupied territory and not allowed to disembark, Andryushchenko said. His account could not be independently verified.In the attack on Odesa, Russian troops fired at least six missiles, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister.\u201cResidents of the city heard explosions in different areas,\u201d Gerashchenko said via Telegram.\u201cResidential buildings were hit. It is already known about one victim. He burned in his car in a courtyard of one of the buildings.\u201dZelenskyy's news conference was held in a Kyiv subway station, where he paused at one point as a train noisily passed through.The subway system, which includes the world's deepest station, attracted widespread attention early in the war when hordes of people took shelter there.Regarding the expected visit Sunday by US officials, Zelenskyy said: \u201cI believe that we will be able to get agreements from the United States or part of that package on arming Ukraine which we agreed on earlier. Besides, we have strategic questions about security guarantees, which it is time to discuss in detail, because the United States will be one of those leaders of security countries for our state.\u201d",

            "text": "Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel became the frontlines of the unprovoked Russian invasion for a month as Putin\u2019s forces attempted to capture the capital city Kyiv.\n\nIrpin was the first of the trio of cities to become free from Russian occupation on March 28. The liberation of Bucha and Hostomel followed on April 1. Also on the same day, Ukrainian Armed Forces regained control over Demidov, Dymer, and Ivankov, towns that had suffered from brutal occupation since the first days of the war. Reports were gathered from numerous sources in Irpin and participants in the counterattack, to create a chronicle of events to document the history of the war and the chapter of Ukraine\u2019s struggle to maintain its independence.\n\nWhen the horror began on February 27\n\nA swarm of Russian helicopters attacked the airfield in Hostomel, home of the Antonov AN-225 airplane, at the beginning of the war. The first fierce battle took place there. On February 27, the first column of Russian armored forces entered Bucha. On the same day, the invading forces took heavy losses for the first time on Vokzalna Street, which was the main transportation route to Irpin. The enemy continued to push for Kyiv, but contrary to the predictions of Russian planners and Western military observers, Russian troops did not reach there in three days or thirty-three. Instead, the Ukrainian Army counterattacked.\n\nThe Russians were stopped on March 8\n\nOn March 8, military experts recorded the last successful attempt by Russian troops to attack on the right flank in the direction of Kyiv. They were moving from the formerly occupied village of Babyntsi in the direction of Kyiv with forces of up to five battalion-tactical groups, but they could not push beyond Bucha. From that moment on, Russian troops lost the ability to advance and began to prepare for defense.\n\nOn March 15, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appointed the head of the military administration in Kyiv region. He selected Oleksandr Pavliuk, former commander of the Ukrainian Peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. Awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine in early March, Zelenskyy appointed him to further strengthen the defense of the capital and Kyiv region.\n\nOn March 17, military experts reported that the Russians had begun digging in across the occupied territories. It was predicted that Russia would try to turn the war into one of attrition, and use its numerical advantage in artillery to destroy Kyiv and its defenders.\n\nOn March 21, the Russians were close to being able to fire not only cruise and ballistic missiles at the center of Kyiv, but also artillery. To accomplish this, however, they needed positions closer than 15 miles.\n\nThe distance was strategically important, because Russian forces had a limited supply of their expensive missiles to used against the capital\u2019s air defense network. Artillery shells, by contrast, are virtually impossible to intercept. They are very cheap and the Russians have huge reserves. It was the use of artillery that brought the greatest destruction to Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, and other cities.\n\nThe first reports of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops surfaced on March 19 and 20. On March 22, Ukrainian Armed Forces expelled the Russians from Makarov, a village near the Zhytomyr highway, and from the village of Moshchun near Pushcha-Vodytsya, along the Irpin River and northeast of the city of Irpin. The Irpin River bank became the main barrier utilized by the defenders of Kyiv.\n\nDue to the demolition of the dam near the village of Demydiv, the water of Irpin River \u2013 which was were previously pumped into the Kyiv Sea \u2013 overflowed and blocked the road for enemy vehicles north of the city of Irpin. The natural obstruction limited possible approaches to the capital to three, or would require the Russians to drive further South. All three bridges across the river on the Zhytomyr, Irpin, and Warsaw routes were blown up in the first days of the war.\n\nOn March 23, the first details of a siege by Russian forces in Bucha and Irpin were reported. Ukrainian troops pushed the Russians to Borodyanka and marched on the outskirts of the Warsaw route. It was along that route that the 40-mile armored convoy traveled, the main supply line for Russian invasion forces in Irpin and Bucha. The Ukrainian military was able to attack the stalled Russian vehicles at that section of the road, and destroy the rear of the Russian army near Kyiv.\n\nThere were actually two main roads for resupply at that time. The best was the Warsaw route from Bucha to Borodyanka and further \u2013 the road north to Ivankov, through the Chernobyl zone to Belarus. The second and more problematic was a little east, along the river Irpin and further to Demydiv, Dymer, and Ivankiv.\n\nFighting in the Russian rear in the region was also visible in satellite images. In a service provided by NASA that collects information about fires visible from space, plumes of burning smoke can be seen along the routes that Russian forces received supplies near Kyiv. The destruction was the result of Ukrainian artillery, and frequent ambushes that destroyed logistics at the Russian rear.\n\nThe military operation around Irpin-Bucha lasted for the next three days. According to military expert Tom Cooper, the Armed Forces went on the offensive, \u201cstriking in different places and at different times along the front line to disrupt the supply of Russian troops.\u201d He described the tactic as an effective way to keep Russian artillery beyond 15 miles from Kyiv, which prevented effective strikes at the city\u2019s center.\n\nOn March 26, it was reported that the Russian military had appointed Alexander Chayko of the Eastern Military District as commander of the 35th Separate Army near Chernobyl. He was expected to regroup Russian troops and lead them into battle. But on the March 28 there was an official announcement about the liberation of Irpin. On April 1, reports confirmed that the Russian army had left the Chernobyl zone.\n\nLiberating cities is harder than defending\n\nThe operation to liberate Irpin began two weeks after the destruction of the Russian rear by the Ukrainian Army. Ukraine Forces recaptured street after street in close combat.\n\nMilitary experts have described urban defense as a hell for any soldier. Defenders always have the advantage. They choose where to fight, and can hold back the dominant forces of the enemy. This tactic gave Ukrainians the advantage at the start of the invasion. However, once Russians captured an area the same tactic made it harder for Ukrainian troops to push them out. But Irpin was an example of Ukraine\u2019s determination, and set the stage for the liberation of the rest of Ukraine.\n\nA member of the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps (DUK), Danya Dansky, offered details of the operation. He participated against Russian hostilities in 2014, including the battles for Donetsk Airport. Before the war, Dansky worked in production of furniture. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, he began military training to defend his homeland. When Putin launched his unprovoked war to seize all of Ukraine, Dansky again volunteered.\n\nOn March 20, his unit arrived in Irpin with the task of liberating the city from enemy forces. At that time, the Ukrainian military controlled the central part of the city and the bridge to Bucha near the Giraffe Mall on Soborna Street, the central street that runs through the entire city and connects Kyiv to Bucha.\n\nOn the eastern and western outskirts of the city, and on both sides at the center, were Russian troops. But they failed to completely occupy the city. Russian troops were based in a triangle in the west of the city and in the northeast.\n\nOne of the final battles took place at the intersection of Hostomel Highway, Vulytsya Severynivs Road, and 10th Street. The Pchelka store at the crossroads was the main landmark.\n\nDansky commanded reconnaissance and cover for his tank unit. The task of his team was to find the enemy, assess its strength, help coordinate an armored attack, and protect the tank in battle. Despite considerable armor and firepower, tanks are vulnerable to anti-tank missiles and grenade launchers. The inability of the Russians to apply basic military tactics left much of their armor without infantry support. The result was that Ukrainian forces were highly effective in the destruction of Russian tanks.\n\nHow the liberation of Irpin took place\n\nAfter arriving in Irpin, Dansky\u2019s platoon began to advance along with a collection of other units. Each day, step by step, they moved forward until the city was completely liberated. In his eight years of fighting, Dansky said he had never encountered such intense artillery fire from the enemy.\n\n\u201cThe Russians got stuck in the buildings. They shot or burned our equipment. But the main problem was that they beat us very hard with artillery, mines, grenades, everything. \u201cIn the first 4 hours when we arrived, they fired 260 shells. We counted. Our artillery could not fire so actively at the Russians, because there were civilians everywhere. The Russian military was not worried at all about civilian casualties or destruction. We had to fight against enemy infantry and also against their armored vehicles. The enemy used tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and even light self-propelled guns in Irpin.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nThe heaviest final battles took place in the area of Hostomel Highway and the military hospital on the northern outskirts of the city. At that time the Russian occupation of Irpin was coming to an end.\n\n\u201cAt the crossroads we met enemy infantry, when they saw our tanks gathered in one place. They were about 54 yards away and started running away after we opened up on them. The Russians left behind many weapons and equipment that will now work against them. And they also left evidence of their robberies. In places where there should be infantry gear used for fighting, we found many stolen things. They were purely looters, taking things to sell back home.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nElite Russian forces in Irpin\n\nThe city was occupied by elite units of the Russian army. Soldiers of the 106th and 98th Airborne Divisions, the 76th and 31st Airborne Assault Divisions, and the Black Sea Fleet Marines were spotted there. These troops are the best trained and equipped units of the Russian army. It was their job to quickly capture the suburbs of Kyiv and storm the capital. But the Ukrainian people stopped their invasion and forced them to retreat.\n\n\u201cWe saw these so-called elite troops flee very quickly. After we came in and advanced on their positions, they immediately ran away. They did not want to die, they were afraid. We were ready to stand to the end, because this is our land,. It will be liberated. Everything will be liberated, both Crimea and Donbas.\u201d \u2013 Danya Dansky\n\nMurders of citizens and destruction of buildings\n\nMost Irpin residents were evacuated in late February and early March. But from the first days of spring, it became dangerous to leave the city alone, outside the humanitarian corridors. During the month of March, while the fighting continued, locals were evacuated in groups over a pedestrian crossing under the destroyed bridge to Romanivka. The efforts took place under fire and at risk of death. After the destruction of the railways, it was the only way to leave Irpin, all other areas were shelled and controlled by the enemy.\n\nBut several thousand people remained in the city during that time, in all areas including the occupied ones. For a month they lived almost without communication, without electricity, no gas, no water, and no heat. They practically did not leave their basements, because they risked their lives to go outside and look for supplies. But many did go out, and became victims of Russian war crimes. Many eyewitness accounts from surviving residents have been collected, about shootings and rapes by Russians. Ukrainian soldiers also saw evidence of those crimes when they entered the city, along with hundreds of boobytraps left behind.\n\nSome of the residents who remained in the city could not leave their sick relatives, some simply decided that it was safer to stay at home. Among them were the elderly. At the same time, the locals helped Ukrainian soldiers, and showed them the safe ways navigate around Irpin.\n\nOnly a few days after the city\u2019s liberation did local authorities and police have the opportunity to pick up and bury the dead. But it was a slow process because occupation forces had left numerous mines, particularly on bodies.\n\nMost of the houses in the city were damaged or destroyed. According to Irpin\u2019s Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, who headed the Irpin Territorial Defense and was in the city all the time helping the townspeople, the western suburbs, the Synergy district with new buildings, and the BKZ district bordering Bucha, all suffered the most damage. The new building in the area of Hostomel Highway were severely damaged from the fighting. Thousands of private estates in all parts of the city were looted and destroyed, along with schools and businesses.\n\nIrpin has started the slow process of cleaning up after war and is in the process of coming back to life. Despite all the attempts by Russian forces to wipe out the town, it remained defiant and victorious. Irpin was awarded the title of \u201cHero City\u201d for stopping the Russian advance, and for its sacrifice. All the artillery shells, rockets, and bombs that fell on Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel could fall on Kyiv.",

            "text": "NATO allies have condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine in one voice. However, divisions persist on matters of energy trade and the extent of sanctions to be imposed on Moscow.\n\nHowever, in an astounding revelation, it has been learned that some NATO allies have been covertly supplying arms to Russia.\n\nAccording to an EU report, France and Germany provided Russia with \u20ac273 million ($295.4 million) in military hardware that is now likely being used in Ukraine, English Daily Newspaper The Telegraph has revealed.\n\nDespite an EU-wide embargo on arms supplies to Russia imposed in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the two powerful NATO allies delivered bombs, rockets, missiles, and guns to Moscow.\n\nBoth France and Germany were mediating between Russia and Ukraine after the Crimean annexation under the Minsk Agreement.\n\nAfter it was discovered that at least ten member states exported around \u20ac350 million ($378.6 million) in hardware to Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, the European Commission was compelled to close the loophole.\n\nGerman and French companies accounted for 78 percent of the total military export.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier accused former leaders of France and Germany, Nicholas Sarkozy and Angela Markel for giving concessions to Russia and denying Ukraine an opportunity to join NATO, France 24 had reported.\n\nHe was speaking at the anniversary of the 2008 NATO meeting in Bucharest, where it was first promised a membership.\n\nAbout eight years ago, the EU outlawed the direct or indirect sale, supply, transfer, or export to Russia of arms and related material of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment, and spare parts.\n\nHowever, despite the prohibition, countries were able to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment to Russia taking advantage of a loophole that allowed contracts signed before August 1, 2014, or subsequent contracts that would help close those agreements, to continue.\n\nHow France and Germany Befooled The EU\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has shown reluctance in arming Ukraine with high-powered and lethal weapons for fear of retaliation from Russia. However, the European community which is already mobilizing cutting-edge equipment for Ukraine is unconvinced.\n\nUnder pressure, Germany had to pull the plug on the Nord Stream II pipeline but it now seems to be drawing a line.\n\nCriticism of Berlin has grown tremendously after it was revealed that German companies had used a loophole in an EU embargo on arms exports to Russia, selling \u201cdual-use\u201d equipment to Moscow for \u20ac121 million ($130.1 million), including guns and special protection vehicles.\n\nUkrainian ambassador to Germany accused Berlin of arming Russia while refusing to send military equipment to Ukraine. In 2020 alone Germany sold \u20ac366 million of dual use goods to Russia. These can be used for military purposes. German policy in the Ukraine crisis is shameful. \u2014 Alan Sked (@profsked) February 13, 2022\n\nInterestingly, Germany had earlier taken advantage of the loopholes in the EU embargo regime against China to supply MTU engines for its submarines. It was not too long ago that it clarified that it was not doing any business with China anymore, as previously observed by the EurAsian Times.\n\nBerlin justified its use of an ambiguity in the EU\u2019s 2014 arms embargo, saying that the products were only delivered after the Kremlin promised they would be used for civilian purposes rather than military ones.\n\nOn the other hand, as part of 76 export licenses, France was also determined to be liable for shipments worth \u20ac152 million ($164.4 million) to Russia. Using a loophole in the EU embargo, Paris permitted exporters to complete contracts signed before 2014.\n\nAlong with bombs, rockets, and torpedoes, French companies delivered thermal imaging cameras, as well as navigation systems for fighter aircraft, attack helicopters and Russian tanks.\n\nSince the Russian invasion began on February 24, the EU has imposed additional limitations on dual-use item exports to Moscow, effectively shutting the loophole. However, the exemption on previously agreed-upon weaponry sales to Russia was not revoked until the bloc\u2019s fifth package of sanctions.\n\nWhen it became clear that weapons were still flowing into Russia, envoys from Poland and Lithuania worked to alter the original 2014 arms embargo language earlier this month.\n\nAccording to data from the European Commission, EU members sold Russia \u20ac39 million ($35.7 million) in weaponry and ammunition last year as the Kremlin prepared for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCountries often cite the \u201cGrandfather Clause\u201d to evade the embargos set by organizations, something that France has chosen as an escape from this situation. A grandfather clause is a provision that allows an old rule to apply to some current instances while a new rule applies to all future cases.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that France goes to the second round of polling soon and these revelations might have some impact on the voting patterns across the French population.\n\nNATO Divided Over Russia?\n\nEven though NATO countries have unanimously condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Russia\u2019s use of brute force and war crimes, there is no perfect agreement among the allies on the extent of sanctions that should be imposed on Russia.\n\nSome countries like Hungary have openly stated that they would not support more sanctions on Russia that would dent its own economy.\n\nFurther, even as the US, the UK, Canada and Australia have completely banned oil purchases from Russia, several European countries have continued to buy the Russian oil which has led to an uptick in supply. However, this could be expected to be sized down in the coming days.\n\nThe fact that France and Germany chose to supply arms to Russia despite largely acknowledging the insurgency fueled by Russia in the Donbas region is telling of Moscow\u2019s role in international integration, trade and defense relationships. However, these same weapons would now be used by the Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nTobias Ellwood, the chairman of the Commons defense committee, believes that at the June NATO meeting in Madrid, all member states should announce that they will not be transferring armaments to Russia.\n\n\u201cIf we agree Russia now presents an existential threat to European security, then there is no excuse for any European country to continue supplying Russia arms,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Russian assault in the Donbas region has intensified manifold in the last few days as it prepares to seize the region from Ukraine. Even as military aid keeps pouring from some NATO states, there is a challenge for the allies to put their own house in order and ensure consensus to avoid public embarrassment and Ukraine\u2019s ire.",

Those ties \u201care contributing to ensuring peace and security in the region and to establishing the international order based on independence and justice.\u201d\n\nFrom Fields to Front Line for Ukraine\u2019s Farmers (9:10 a.m.)\n\nUkraine is the world\u2019s largest producer of sunflower oil and among the top six exporters of wheat, corn, chicken and even honey.\n\nThe money it earns from agriculture -- $28 billion last year -- is now more vital because of the war effort, and the produce more critical for a world where record prices are raising concerns about food security.\n\nMany farmers have swapped their workwear for fatigues, for now. \u201cOnce a farmer always a farmer,\u201d said Yaroslav Andrushko, the chief executive of a small agriculture company. \u201cBut circumstances required us to take up arms.\u201d\n\nUN Chief to Meet Erdogan Before Moscow, Kyiv Trip (9:05 a.m.)\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres will meet Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Monday, Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said.\n\nGuterres then travels to Moscow, where he\u2019ll meet President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and on to Kyiv for meetings with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nThe UN. chief last week asked for separate meetings with Putin and Zelenskiy to discuss \u201curgent steps\u201d for peace. Turkey has been a leading mediator during the two-month war.\n\nTraveler Flow Between Poland, Ukraine Reversing (8:38 a.m.)\n\nMore travelers entered Ukraine from Poland on Saturday than departed, Polish border authorities said, continuing the recent trend of Ukrainians slowly returning after Russian forces pulled out of the north.\n\nSome 15,100 people were cleared to enter Poland on the day while 21,100 left Poland for Ukraine. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 over 2.9 million people have entered Poland from Ukraine -- a large proportion of the over 5 million who\u2019ve left the country.\n\nUkraine Continues to Repel Russia Along Line of Contact (7:30 a.m.)\n\nRussia has made some territorial gains, likely at \u201csignificant cost\u201d to its troops, but numerous assaults along the line of contact in the Donbas this week have been repelled, the U.K. said in an intelligence update.\n\n\u201cPoor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,\u201d the U.K. said.\n\nRussia continues to attack the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, including with strikes from long-range aircraft. Satellite images in towns near Mariupol show what appear to be mass graves; city officials have estimated 10,000 or more may have died during the week\u2019s long siege.\n\nGermany to Borrow Extra 40 Billion Euros to Cushion War Blow (11:41 p.m.)\n\nGermany will increase its borrowing plans this year to cushion the effect of the war in Ukraine, taking the total for net new debt to almost 140 billion euros, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe adjustment is needed to help finance measures to offset the economic impact of the war and surging energy prices on companies and consumers, said the people. The plan will be presented to the cabinet on Wednesday, and then onto parliament for approval.\n\nZelenskiy Says Austin, Blinken Will Visit (6:40 p.m.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be discussing the list of weapons we need and the pace of their delivery to Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskiy said at a press conference in a Kyiv subway station. \u201cI will emphasize again -- the last week, the signals, the messages, the tone on weapon supplies -- everything has improved.\u201d Ukraine is waiting for the security situation to allow the U.S. president to visit, he said.\n\nThe U.S. National Security Council and the State Department did not immediately comment. The visits, if confirmed, would be the first by top American officials to Ukraine\u2019s capital since the war began.\n\nZelenskiy Says Weapons Flow May Bolster Counteroffensive (6:40 p.m.)\n\nZelenskiy also said accelerated weapon supplies from the U.S. and European nations may enable Ukraine\u2019s military to step its counteroffensive. \u201cParticularly, we see a change in the speed of response from the U.S., and if this speed increases, we\u2019ll be able to speed up de-occupation of our territory.\u201d\n\nThe president said Ukraine\u2019s military isn\u2019t in a position to relieve forces and citizens trapped in the Azovstal factory in Mariupol, which is encircled by Russian forces.\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "text": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces called in airstrikes on a besieged steel factory in the southern city of Mariupol to try to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops holding out in the strategic port, Ukrainian officials said Sunday, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would meet in Kyiv with two top American officials.Zelenskyy gave few details about the logistics of his planned talks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on what was the 60th day since Russia invaded Ukraine. But he told reporters he expected the Americans to come bringing \"not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons.\"The visit would be the first to Ukraine's capital by high-level U.S. officials since the invasion began Feb. 24. While visiting Poland in March, Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil to meet with the country's foreign minister. Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a U.S. leader was Feb. 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris.The meeting was set to take place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter, an occasion Zelenskyy highlighted the allegorical significance of to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\"The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!\" he said, speaking Sunday from the ancient St. Sophia Cathedral.Russia has been trying to take Mariupol for nearly two months, and the city on the Sea of Azov has seen some of the war's worst deprivations. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014.Some 2,000 troops have been fighting tenaciously to hold on to the last remaining Ukrainian outpost in the city, the Azovstal steel plant, which also has civilians taking refuge in its labyrinthine tunnel system.Russian forces have continued to pummel the plant, hitting it with air strikes, including by long-range aircraft, Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesman for the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff, said Sunday.Mariupol has been blockaded for most of the war. Ukrainian officials have said they expect to find thousands of dead civilians and evidence of war crimes there when the fighting ends. Satellite images have shown what appear to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol.In the last day, Russia also pressed its attacks elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war and the Russians are aiming to gain full control over Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland.Shtupun said Russian forces intensified their assault operations toward the cities of Popasna and Siverodonetsk in Luhansk, and Kurakhiv in Donetsk. Luhansk regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that eight people were killed and two others were wounded in a Russian barrage on Saturday.The Russians also have shelled the Dnipro region west of Donbas, where at least one person was killed by a Russian missile, according to regional Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko.Russia has pulled back forces from Kyiv, and the north of the country to feed into the Donbas offensive, but the British Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week.\"Despite Russia making some territorial gains, Ukrainian resistance has been strong across all axes and inflicted significant cost on Russian forces,\" the ministry said in an intelligence update.\"Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,\" it said.In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. A 3-month-old baby was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, officials said. Zelenskyy said 18 more were wounded.\"The war started when this baby was one month old. Can you imagine what is happening?\" Zelenskyy said. \"They are just bastards. ... I don't have any other words for it, just bastards.\"The Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.The command post was hit on Friday, killing two generals and critically wounding another, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency said in a statement. The Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.If true, at least nine Russian generals have been killed since the start of the invasion, according to Ukrainian reports.On Saturday the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the Mariupol steel plant, released a video of around two dozen women and children sheltering there. Its contents could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians trapped underground there.The video shows soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl said she and her relatives had \"seen neither the sky nor the sun\" since they left home Feb. 27.The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told the AP the video was shot Thursday. The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed by far-right activists in 2014 at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and has elicited criticism for some of its tactics.More than 100,000 people - down from a prewar population of about 430,000 - are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city.Yet another attempt to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol failed Saturday. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organized buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 141 miles to the northwest.",

This hasn\u2019t been the case since the Cold War,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area\u201d in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe said.\n\nCurrently, there are about 20 Russian warships positioned around the Mediterranean, Lavernhe told the AFP news agency. Meanwhile, the United States has doubled its naval presence in the region since the start of the Ukraine war, the official said.\n\n\u201cWhere there are American forces, the Russians are there too,\u201d Lavernhe said. \u201cRussian ships are positioned to monitor the activity of allied forces.\u201d\n\nNATO operated about three aircraft carrier strike groups in the region before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings, and two more were destroyed on Saturday, the Ukrainian armed forces said.\n\nThe death toll could not be independently verified. The last big strike on or near Odesa was in early April.\n\n___\n\nBlinken, Austin to Visit Kyiv and Hold Talks with Zelenskyy\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said Saturday.\n\nThe U.S. top diplomat and Pentagon chief will hold talks with Zelenskyy and discuss what kinds of weapons are to be provided to Ukraine to confront the Russian offensive, the Ukrainian leader said during a press conference.\n\nThe visit was announced after President Joe Biden add an extra $800 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nRussia Investigates Media Report on Presence of British SAS Special Forces in Ukraine\n\nRussia\u2019s top state investigative body said on Saturday it was looking into a Russian media report alleging that sabotage experts from Britain\u2019s Special Air Service (SAS) have been deployed to western Ukraine.\n\nThe SAS is an elite military force trained to conduct special operations, surveillance, and counter-terrorism. Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti news agency on Saturday quoted a Russian security source as saying about 20 SAS members had been sent to the Lviv region.\n\nIn a statement, the Investigative Committee said it would follow up on the report that they had been sent in \u201cto assist the Ukrainian special services in organizing sabotage on the territory of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe British Ministry of Defense had no immediate comment on the Russian investigation in response to a Reuters request.\n\nBritain said it sent military trainers to Ukraine earlier this year to instruct local forces in using anti-tank weapons but the British government said on Feb. 17\u2014a week before Russia\u2019s invasion\u2014that it had pulled out all troops except those needed to protect its ambassador.\n\nIt was not clear what steps the Investigative Committee planned to take in response to any SAS involvement in Ukraine. But the investigation into the possible presence of forces from a NATO country is significant, given that Russia has issued warnings to the West not to get in the way of its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine.\n\n___\n\nRussian Space Chief Warns of Possible Trigger for World War III\n\nAn attack against a spacecraft could usher in the next global war, Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia\u2019s national space agency Roscosmos, said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cOne must keep in mind that the destruction of a foreign spacecraft means World War III. It\u2019s a casus belli, and there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Rogozin said, using a Latin term for a formal legal reason to start a war.\n\nRogozin was commenting on Washington\u2019s decision to stop conducting anti-satellite missile tests. Announcing the move on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris called the destruction of satellites during such tests \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d because it leaves dangerous space debris.\n\nThe Roscosmos chief, however, argued that the United States is now \u201cpretending to be doves\u201d because it had already conducted all the necessary tests. \u201cThis move should, therefore, be strictly viewed as propaganda,\u201d he said.\n\nRogozin argued that the Boeing X-37, an unmanned U.S. shuttle-like spacecraft currently orbiting the Earth, could potentially be used for spying and carrying weapons of mass destruction. He said that a proposal by Russia and China to sign a treaty banning the placement of weapons in outer space was met with \u201cdead silence\u201d in Washington.\n\nThe stationing of weapons of mass destruction in outer space has been internationally banned since 1967.\n\n____\n\nGeneral Accuses Boris Johnson of Disclosing Military Secrets\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is \u201ctempting evil\u201d with his statements about the training of Ukrainian troops abroad amid the conflict with Russia, Polish General Waldemar Skrzypczak, who advises the defense minister, said on Friday.\n\nDuring a visit to India earlier this week, Johnson told journalists that \u201cwe are currently training Ukrainians in Poland in the use of anti-aircraft defense, and actually in the UK in the use of armored vehicles.\u201d\n\nSkrzypczak, who headed one of the multinational divisions in Iraq in the mid-2000s, told Polish newspaper Fakt that \u201cwhen we were on missions abroad it was hard to imagine that one of the politicians would talk about our plans or training on television.\u201d\n\nBy making the comments, Johnson \u201creveals military secrets\u201d to Russia, the general said. \u201cTraining is a military matter and must be kept under wraps. The man should \u2026 think before saying such things.\u201d\n\nThe former commander of Poland\u2019s land forces called the prime minister\u2019s behavior \u201cextremely irresponsible,\u201d warning that it could lead to \u201cdisastrous consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prime minister may not be aware of this, but with such statements he endangers the success of the entire military operation, as well as the safety of soldiers,\u201d Skrzypczak said.\n\n_____\n\nRussia to Deploy Sarmat Missiles by Autumn in \u2018Historic\u2019 Nuclear Upgrade\n\nRussia said on Saturday it plans to deploy its newly tested Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles by autumn.\n\nThe target stated by Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, is an ambitious one as Russia reported its first test-launch only on Wednesday and Western military experts say more will be needed before the missile can be deployed.\n\nThe Sarmat is capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads and decoys, and of striking targets thousands of miles away in the United States or Europe.\n\nThis week\u2019s test, after years of delays due to funding and technical issues, marks a show of strength by Russia at a time when the war in Ukraine has sent tensions with the United States and its allies soaring to their highest levels since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.\n\nRogozin said in an interview with Russian state TV that the missiles would be deployed with a unit in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, about 3,000 km (1,860 miles) east of Moscow.\n\nHe said they would be placed at the same sites and in the same silos as the Soviet-era Voyevoda missiles they are replacing, something that would save \u201ccolossal resources and time.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the \u201csuper-weapon\u201d was a historic event that would guarantee the security of Russia\u2019s children and grandchildren for the next 30 to 40 years, Rogozin added.\n\nWestern concern about the risk of nuclear war has increased since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 with a speech in which he pointedly referred to Moscow\u2019s nuclear forces and warned that any attempt to get in Russia\u2019s way \u201cwill lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJapan, Russia Reach Agreement on Fishing Quotas Amid Ukraine-Related Sanctions\n\nJapan and Russia have reached an agreement on Tokyo\u2019s fishing quotas for salmon and trout spawned in Russian rivers, despite Moscow\u2019s anger over the spate of economic sanctions that Tokyo imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nJapan\u2019s Fisheries Agency said Saturday that the two countries agreed on Tokyo\u2019s fishing quota of 2,050 tons of salmon and trout within its exclusive economic zone, with the agreement expected to be signed next week, Kyodo News reported.\n\nUnder the agreement, Japan will pay an annual cooperation fee of between 200 million yen ($1.56 million) and 300 million yen ($2.34 million) to Russia, depending on the eventual tonnage of the catch. A cooperation fee is paid to the country where the fish were spawned.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\nUkraine President Spoke With UK\u2019s Johnson About \u2018New Phase\u2019 of Military Aid\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson about a \u201cnew phase\u201d of military aid, including the provision of heavy weapons, the president\u2019s deputy chief of staff Andriy Sybiga said on Saturday.\n\nSpeaking on national television, Sybiga said the pair also talked about further financial support for Ukraine on the call.\n\n____\n\nZelenskyy: Allies Finally Delivering Weapons Kyiv Asked For\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday said allies were finally delivering the weapons that Kyiv had asked for, adding the arms would help save the lives of thousands of people.\n\nIn a late-night video address, Zelenskyy also said comments earlier in the day by a Russian commander about the need to link up with Moldova showed Moscow wanted to invade other countries.\n\n_____\n\nUkraine: Missile Attack Kills 5 in Odesa\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president says five people were killed in a missile attack in the Black Sea port city of Odesa.\n\nUkraine presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, provided the information Saturday.\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister earlier said Russian forces fired at least six cruise missiles at the city.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko said in a Telegram post on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were able to shoot down several missiles, but at least one landed and exploded.\n\n____\n\nUS Warns Russia of \u2018Astronomical\u2019 Nuclear Price\n\nRussia would pay an \u201castronomical\u201d price should its President Vladimir Putin order the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, said on Friday amid the ongoing Russian offensive.\n\nIn an interview for the Ukrainian outlet European Pravda, Nuland was asked to assess the possibility of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons. She responded that she could not rule out such a \u201ccatastrophic scenario\u201d as Putin \u201chas already ordered\u201d what, she alleged, were \u201cbrutal war crimes,\u201d and the world must be prepared for the worst. At the same time, Nuland stressed, the consequences of such steps would be catastrophic for Russia and for Putin personally.\n\nShe refused to provide any details about the potential response from the West, saying instead that use of nuclear weapons would take the situation to a \u201cfundamentally new level\u201d where the price will be \u201csimply astronomical.\u201d\n\nAsked by a journalist if Kyiv can rely on its Western partners\u2019 support in a worst-case scenario, Nuland reassured Ukraine that it would not be left alone. Meanwhile, the under secretary of state said, the United States would continue to provide Ukraine with military assistance. She revealed that Washington has begun supplying Kyiv with multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and would do its best to keep up with Ukraine\u2019s needs.\n\nNuland\u2019s strongly-worded warnings came just two days after the Pentagon said that at this point it does not see a need to change the country\u2019s nuclear posture. The U.S. Department of Defense spokesman\u2019s statement followed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s claims that Moscow could use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\n_____\n\nPentagon Seeking Info From US Industry on Ukraine-Ready Systems\n\nThe Pentagon is looking for new avenues for U.S. industry to accelerate production and build more capacity for proven, effective weapons that require minimal training and can be rapidly exported to Ukraine, according to a government website posting on Friday.\n\nThe Department of Defense posted a request for information on SAM.gov that had an initial response deadline of May 6 and sought information on weapons or commercial capabilities related to air defense, anti-armor, anti-personnel, coastal defense, counter battery, unmanned aerial systems, and communications like radios or satellite internet.\n\n______\n\nGermany Should Stop Sending Weapons to Ukraine: Public Figures\n\nFurther military aid to Ukraine would only lead to an uncontrollable escalation of hostilities and prolong the suffering of the people caught up in the fighting, a group of German politicians and public figures have warned Chancellor Olaf Scholz in an open letter. By providing arms to Kyiv, Germany and other NATO nations \u201chave de facto made themselves a war party,\u201d the letter published by the Berliner Zeitung on Friday has said.\n\nThe co-authors of the letter, which include the ex-vice president of the Bundestag, Antje Vollmer, and a former U.N. assistant secretary general, Hans-Christof Graf von Sponeck, have said that Ukraine has \u201cbecome the battlefield for the conflict between NATO and Russia over the security order in Europe,\u201d which is now waged \u201cat the expense of the Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\nIf the conflict is not stopped quickly, it will end up in \u201canother big war\u201d similar to Word War I, the letter warns, adding that this time nuclear weapons might be used, bringing \u201cwidespread devastation and the end of human civilization.\u201d Avoiding further destruction and escalation should be an \u201cabsolute priority,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe co-authors, who also include a former German MP, Norman Paech, as well as an ex-director of the Center for Conflict Research in Marburg, Johannes Becker, maintain that NATO\u2019s military support only delays a diplomatic solution, fueling the resistance of the Ukrainian army that \u201chas little chance of winning.\u201d Instead, steps to end the bloodshed must be taken, they argue.\n\n___\n\nRussia Reveals Crew Losses From Sunken Warship\n\nAt least one person was killed and another 27 are missing after the Moskva, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, sunk earlier this month, according to Russian state media.\n\nAnother 396 crew members were evacuated to nearby ships and sent on to Sevastopol, a city in Crimea, Russia\u2019s TASS news agency reported. The Russian government, as of Tuesday, had not previously acknowledged any casualties.\n\nThe Moskva, a guided-missile cruiser, sunk on April 14, though the cause remains disputed.\n\nUkraine says it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles, which sparked a fire that detonated stored ammunition. The Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns, and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had massive amounts of explosives aboard.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry, however, says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ammunition and the resulting explosions left the Moskva with structural damage. It says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port.\n\nPhotos and a short video clip emerged early Monday on social media showing the Moskva badly damaged and on fire in the hours before it sank. The images show the Moskva listing to one side, with black holes from possible missile puncture marks, and significant scarring just above the waterline on the port (left) side in the middle of the vessel. The Kremlin on Monday said it had seen the photos of the Moskva but that they could not verify them.\n\n_____\n\nUkraine: Russians Trying to Storm Steel Mill\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine\u2019s presidential office says Russian forces are attacking a steel plant that is the last defense stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the strategic port city of Mariupol.\n\nOleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, said during a briefing on Saturday that the Russian forces have resumed airstrikes on Azovstal and were trying to storm it.\n\nArestovich\u2019s statement came two days after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the whole of Mariupol, with the exception of Azovstal, had been \u201cliberated\u201d by the Russians.\n\nPutin ordered the Russian military not to storm the plant and instead to block it off in an apparent attempt to stifle the remaining pocket of resistance there.\n\n____\n\nLviv Announces Curfew Starting Easter Night\n\nLviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy has announced a curfew starting on Orthodox Easter night.\n\nCiting \u201cnew intelligence,\u201d Kozytskyy said the curfew would run from 11 p.m. Saturday to 5 a.m. Sunday, and then every day between those hours until further notice.\n\nKozytskyy said the church leadership is in support of the decision and that all churches in the region will be postponing their Easter night services until the morning hours.\n\n____\n\nCivilian Evacuation Effort Set for Mariupol\n\nEfforts to evacuate civilians to safer areas will continue in Ukraine on Saturday, the country\u2019s officials said.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram messaging app there will be another attempt to evacuate women, children, and the elderly from the strategic port city of Mariupol, which has been besieged by Russian forces for weeks.\n\nThe Kremlin earlier this week declared that Mariupol has been \u201cliberated,\u201d with the exception of the Azovstal steel mill, the last pocket of resistance where Ukrainian troops are holed up.\n\nVereshchuk said that \u201cif everything goes according to plan,\u201d the evacuation in Mariupol will begin at midday on Saturday. Many previous attempts to evacuate civilians from the city have failed.\n\nThe governor of the eastern Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on Telegram that an evacuation train will depart Saturday from the eastern city of Pokrovsk. Residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland known as Donbas, will be able to take the train free of charge.\n\nIt will bring them to the Western city of Chop near Ukraine\u2019s border with Slovakia and Hungary, according to Haidai.\n\n_____\n\nUS Convening Talks on Ukraine\u2019s Defense Needs\n\nThe Pentagon says U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will convene a meeting next week in Germany of defense officials and military leaders from more than 20 countries to discuss Ukraine\u2019s immediate and long-term defense needs.\n\nThe Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said Friday that about 40 nations, including NATO members, were invited and that responses are still arriving for the session to be held Tuesday at Ramstein air base. He did not identify the nations that have agreed to attend but said more details will be provided in coming days.\n\nThe meeting comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a major offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe agenda will include an updated assessment of the Ukraine battlefield as well as discussion of efforts to continue a steady flow of weapons and other military aid, Kirby said. It will include consultations on Ukraine\u2019s post-war defense needs but is not expected to consider changes in the U.S. military posture in Europe, he said.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says Ukrainian Fighters \u2018Securely Blockaded\u2019 at Mariupol Steel Plant\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian fighters and foreign mercenaries had been \u201csecurely blockaded\u201d at the Azovstal steel plant where they have been holding out in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin had ordered his defense minister on Thursday to block off the vast Azovstal complex \u201cso not even a fly can get through\u201d rather than try to storm it.\n\nThe defense ministry also said Russia had hit dozens of targets in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions of Ukraine on Friday.\n\n\u201cAll remnants of the Ukrainian \u2018Azov\u2019 Nazis, together with foreign mercenaries from the United States and European countries, are securely blockaded on the territory of the Azovstal plant,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Nazis are ignoring our demands to release the women and children allegedly with them to travel freely in any direction.\u201d\n\nPutin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 with the stated aim of demilitarizing and \u201cdenazifying\u201d the country.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Says Shelling of Eastern Luhansk\u2019s Cities Intensifying\n\nAll the Ukrainian-controlled cities in the eastern region of Luhansk were being shelled by Russian forces on Saturday and the barrage was intensifying, the region\u2019s governor Serhiy Haidai said on television.\n\nHe claimed Ukrainian forces were leaving some settlements there in order to regroup, but that the move did not amount to a critical setback. Russia denies targeting civilian areas.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russian Forces Made No Major Gains in the Last 24 Hours\n\nRussian forces have made no major gains in the last 24 hours despite increased activity, as Ukrainian counterattacks continue to hinder their efforts, British military intelligence claimed on Saturday.\n\nDespite Russia\u2019s claimed conquest of the port city of Mariupol, heavy fighting continues to frustrate Moscow\u2019s attempts to capture the city, impeding their progress in the Donbas region, the Ministry of Defence claimed on Twitter.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the report.\n\n_____\n\nKyiv Accuses Moscow of \u2018Imperialism\u2019 After Russia Flags Interest in South Ukraine\n\nMoscow wants to take full control over southern Ukraine, a Russian general said on Friday, a statement Ukraine said gave the lie to Russia\u2019s previous assertions that it had no territorial ambitions.\n\nRustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district, was quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to Transnistria, a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Minnekayev\u2019s statement showed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was \u201cintended only as a beginning.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry said Russia\u2019s goal of the \u201csecond phase\u201d of the war is \u201csimply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine. Imperialism as it is.\u201d\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Jalina Porter declined specific comment on Minnekayev\u2019s statement but said Washington firmly supported Moldova\u2019s sovereignty and was \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about events on the ground. \u201cNo one should be fooled by the Kremlin\u2019s announcements,\u201d Porter said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment when asked if Russia had expanded the goals of its operation and how Moscow saw the political future of southern Ukraine.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says It Shot Down Ukrainian Fighter Jet in Kharkiv Region\n\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said on Saturday that its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet and destroyed three MI-8 helicopters at an airfield in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Ukraine regarding the Russian claims.\n\n_____\n\nG20 Cannot Function With Russia at the Table, Canada Claims\n\nThe Group of 20 major economies cannot effectively function as long as Russia remains a member, Canada\u2019s finance minister claimed on Friday after a week of protests against Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington.\n\nDiscord over Russia\u2019s presence at the meetings has been on display all week, with officials from the United States, Canada, Britain, and other Western countries staging walkouts three days in a row whenever Russian officials spoke.\n\nThe G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, who met in Washington on Wednesday, failed to agree on its traditional communique outlining economic policy goals as Russia blocked language condemning its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe IMF steering committee and the World Bank-IMF Development Committee also failed to issue joint statements.\n\n\u201cThe G20 can\u2019t function effectively with Russia at the table,\u201d Chrystia Freeland, Canadian minister of finance who is of Ukrainian descent, told a news conference with Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko in Washington.\n\nThe tensions have called into question the effectiveness of the G20, which includes Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, as well as China, India, Indonesia, and South Africa, which have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict.\n\nThis year\u2019s G20 host country Indonesia is still optimistic that progress can be made on a number of issues despite the tensions, Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cEven with a walk out, we all agree\u201d on the substance of work that needs to be done, Indrawati said.\n\nIndrawati said she is more focused on \u201cgrassroots\u201d technical work underlying issues such as strengthening a G20 common debt framework for poor countries, and creating a new financing mechanism for future pandemic needs, than issuing a communique at the present stage.\n\nWith other G20 finance meetings scheduled for July and October and a leaders summit in November, Indrawati said there was ample time to continue progress.\n\n\u201cIf there is no forum at all, then the world is going to be in a much worse place,\u201d with each country setting policy without regard for others.\n\n____\n\nRussia Says It Plans Full Control of Donbas and Southern Ukraine; Moldova Summons Russian Ambassador\n\nRussia plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine during the second phase of what it calls its special military operation, the deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district said on Friday, reported Russian news agencies.\n\nThe Interfax and TASS news agencies cited him as saying that full control of southern Ukraine would improve Russian access to Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transdniestria, which borders Ukraine.\n\n\u201cControl over the south of Ukraine is another way to Transdniestria, where there is also evidence that the Russian-speaking population is being oppressed,\u201d TASS quoted Minnekayev as saying at a meeting in Russia\u2019s central Sverdlovsk region.\n\nMoldova\u2019s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian ambassador to express \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the remarks.\n\n\u201cThese statements are unfounded and contradict the position of the Russian Federation supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of Moldova,\u201d it said on its website.\n\n\u201cDuring the meeting, it was reiterated that the republic of Moldova \u2026 is a neutral state and this principle must be respected by all international actors, including the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\n____\n\nUkraine: Russian Offensive Continues in East\n\nThe Ukraine military\u2019s general staff says that Russian forces continue their \u201coffensive operations\u201d in eastern Ukraine with the goal of defeating Ukrainian forces, establishing full control over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and securing \u201ca land route between these territories and the occupied Crimea.\u201d\n\nUkrainian forces in the past 24 hours repelled eight Russian attacks in the two regions, destroying nine tanks, 18 armored units and 13 vehicles, a tanker, and three artillery systems, the general staff said on its Facebook page on Saturday morning.\n\nRussian forces continue to partially block and shell Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, and are active in the area of Izyum, the update said.\n\nIn the strategic port city of Mariupol, Russian troops \u201ccontinue to blockade\u201d Ukrainian units in the area of the Azovstal steelworks, the last remaining stronghold, and \u201claunch air strikes on the city, including with the use of long-range aircraft,\u201d the post said, adding that an engineering unit arrived in Mariupol in order to demine the port infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nUN Chief to Meet Putin and Zelenskyy Next Week\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will visit Moscow next week to meet Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin and then head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nGuterres will head to Moscow on Tuesday and meet Putin as well as having a working meeting and lunch with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Eri Kaneko, Guterres\u2019 associate spokesperson, told a news briefing in New York on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe hopes to talk about what can be done to bring peace to Ukraine urgently,\u201d Kaneko said.\n\nHe will meet with Zelenskyy on Thursday, foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and staff at UN agencies to discuss the scaling up of humanitarian assistance efforts, the U.N. spokesperson\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nAldgra Fredly, Allen Zhong, CNN, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Over the past eight weeks, Ukrainians have shown incredible resilience against the Russian invasion. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, over 21,000 Russian soldiers have died since the start of the invasion (Western officials estimate the figure is closer to 15,000). Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have died, and the United States believes that 2,000 to 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers have perished in the war. This is in addition to the 14,000 ethnic Ukrainians and Russians who perished after the first Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Simply put, the war has been catastrophic.\n\nDespite these tremendous losses, the Ukrainians have stood their ground. Ukrainian forces have destroyed thousands of Russian tanks, aircraft, helicopters, and armored vehicles. They also sank the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Simply put, the Ukrainians have stalled Russian advances in the country. Except for Kherson, a city located just north of the Crimean peninsula, the Ukrainians have yet to lose a metropolitan center to the Russians.\n\nBut how long can the Ukrainians hold out?\n\nWhile the international community continues to aid Ukraine, the Ukrainians desperately need military assistance. The Ukrainian army and its volunteer battalions need bulletproof vests, helmets, boots, and ammunition. The country has also called for medical assistance so that hospitals can tend to injured combatants and civilians. Finally, Ukraine is in urgent need of funding; the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine have already surpassed $100 billion. A food crisis is also possible.\n\nGiven the devastation caused by the war, Ukraine\u2019s borders must remain open. Numerous forms of humanitarian, medical, and military aid have arrived in Ukraine by way of Poland. Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, has become a major hub for this effort.\n\nIf the international community continues to provide aid to Ukraine, then the Ukrainians can win the war. According to reports, Russia executed its invasion incredibly poorly, with casualties now mounting and much of its equipment destroyed. The losses are leading to a major decline in Russian morale.\n\nMeanwhile, half a million Ukrainians have returned to Ukraine to protect their homeland, and countless foreign fighters have traveled to Ukraine to help defend the country. Overall, Ukrainian morale is high. The Ukrainian military\u2019s persistence could force the Russians from the country, reminiscent of the Finns defeating the Soviets in the 1939-1940 war. Ukraine\u2019s resilience, economic sanctions, and the continued loss of Russian life could be enough to stop the Russian invasion.\n\nThe Russian incursion is also behind schedule. According to reports provided by the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, the Russian General Staff is dissatisfied with the progress of the invasion. Russian officials assumed they would capture Kyiv within four days, and the country within fifteen. Neither occurred.\n\nGiven the failed conquest in northern Ukraine and Russia\u2019s inability to penetrate Ukrainian forces near Kyiv, the Russians have now resorted to a two-front war. In the south, Russian forces are moving through the Crimean peninsula. They established naval superiority, captured the city of Kherson, and launched an offensive in Mariupol. In the east, the Russians entered the country through the controlled territories in Luhansk and Donetsk. The Russians have attempted to capture the major cities in the east, such as Kharkiv and Kramatorsk, but Ukrainian forces have kept them at bay. As a result, the Russians have resorted to shelling these cities, leading to the deaths of thousands of civilians.\n\nWhile Ukraine has stood its ground, new problems could emerge. The Russians have now recruited volunteers from Chechnya and Syria, and Russian president Vladimir Putin is also trying to coerce Belarusian president Alyaksandr Lukashenko to join the fight. Belarusian involvement could be catastrophic for Ukraine, as the distance from the Belarusian-Ukrainian border to Kyiv is only 140 miles. If the Belarusians were to invade northern Ukraine, this could turn the tide in Russia\u2019s favor. The Ukrainians have done well in holding the Russians at bay, but fighting against two armies would be an incredible challenge.\n\nIf Belarusian forces were to enter the war, they could try to disrupt the humanitarian corridor in western Ukraine. Belarusian forces would look to position themselves near the Polish-Ukrainian border. This would stretch the Ukrainian military and its volunteer battalions by forcing them to fight on another front. A new front for Ukraine would allow the Russians to make further advances in southern and eastern Ukraine. Understanding that the corridor with Poland is essential to Ukraine\u2019s survival, Ukrainian forces would need to combat the Belarusians so that the Ukrainians could receive humanitarian, medical, and defense aid from the international community. In other words, if the Belarusians establish a presence near the Polish-Ukrainian border, this would cut off aid to Ukraine.\n\nTherefore, the corridor to Ukraine must remain open, and the international community should continue to arm Ukraine. If Syrian and Chechen mercenaries join the fight, and if the Belarusians cut off the international community\u2019s supply chain to western Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s chances of winning the war will be significantly diminished. However, swiftly providing Ukraine with the lethal and nonlethal aid it needs will help it win the war. Time is of the essence.\n\nMark Temnycky is an accredited freelance journalist covering Eastern Europe and a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nImage: Reuters",

It said Russia had \"acknowledged that the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, Russia's Central Military District said it planned to seize Ukraine's south as part of the \"second phase\" of its military operation.\n\nOver 369,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Germany\n\nAt least 369,000 people fleeing the war have registered in Germany since Russia invaded on February 24, Germany's Interior Ministry said on Friday.\n\nThe precise number to register is 369,381, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed, adding that the actual number is probably much higher.\n\nUN says humanitarian law 'tossed aside,' documents 50 civilians killed in Bucha\n\nThe United Nations said Friday that 50 civilians had been killed in Bucha, some of whom by summary execution.\n\nA UN mission to the Kyiv suburb documented the killings.\n\n\"During a mission to Bucha on the ninth of April, UN human rights officers documented the unlawful killing including by summary execution of some 50 civilians there,\" said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for Michelle Bachelet, UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nBachelet, meanwhile, said on Friday that since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 \"international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored but seemingly tossed aside.\"\n\nThe UN says, in total, it has received more than 300 allegations of civilians being killed in the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, all under the control of Russian armed forces in late February and early March.\n\nAccording to the Geneva Convention, the killing of persons \"taking no active part in hostilities\" constitutes a war crime.\n\nWatch video 00:36 UN official in Ukraine: 'Mariupol is an unfolding tragedy.'\n\nAustralia adds Putin daughters to sanctions lists\n\nAustralia has imposed sanctions and travel bans on two daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has also been targeted, the Australian government said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe statement did not name the two relations of Putin but the president is known to have two adult daughters, Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova.\n\nThe fresh round of sanctions also targets 144 Russian senators.\n\nForeign Minister Marisa Payne added that Canberra will continue to increase the pressure on Moscow by targeting those who bear responsibility for the \"unjustified and unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.\"\n\nWatch video 02:19 Ukrainians' day-to-day lives of suffering\n\nRussian military aims for 'full control' of southern Ukraine, route to Trans-Dniester\n\nMoscow is planning to seize Ukraine's south and open a route to Moldova's Trans-Dniester region, as part of the \"second phase\" of its military operation, Russia's Central Military District (CFD) command said.\n\nIn a statement carried by TASS and Interfax, Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of the CFD, said Russia plans to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine, allowing it access to Trans-Dniester.\n\n\"Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Trans-Dniester,\" Minnekayev said. He then claimed there was evidence of \"oppression\" of the Russian-speaking population there.\n\nRussia had previously used claims of oppression of Russian minorities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine as grounds for military action.\n\nA pro-Russian regime has de facto ruled the breakaway republic of Trans-Dniester since the 1990s, with support from Russian troops.\n\nKyiv has previously warned that Russia may use the region to launch attacks into western Ukraine, potentially surrounding Ukrainian forces in the south of the country, especially around the Odesa region.\n\nMariupol mayor pleads for evacuations but top official says routes too dangerous\n\nThe mayor of Mariupol has pleaded for the \"full evacuation\" of the southern city, but Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said there \"will be no humanitarian corridors\" in the country on Friday.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said \"about 100,000 people remain\" in the city, which President Vladimir Putin says is now controlled by Russian forces, a claim Ukraine denies.\n\nHowever, Deputy PM Vereshchuk said it would be too dangerous for civilians to leave on Friday.\n\n\"Because of the insecurity along the routes, there will be no humanitarian corridors today, April 22,\" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nWatch video 03:40 Russia claims victory in Mariupol\n\nUK: Russia wants to free up troops by not storming Mariupol steel plant\n\nIn an intelligence update on the Ukraine conflict, the UK suggested \"Putin's decision to blockade the Azovstal steel plant likely indicates a desire to contain Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol and free up Russian forces to be deployed elsewhere in eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin previously said it was unnecessary to storm the industrial zone containing the plant.\n\n\"A full ground assault by Russia on the plant would likely incur significant Russian casualties, further decreasing their overall combat effectiveness,\" the UK Ministry of Defense posted on Twitter.\n\nThe statement also said that despite Russia's \"renewed focus they are still suffering from losses sustained earlier in the conflict. In order to try and reconstitute their depleted forces, they have resorted to transiting inoperable equipment back to Russia for repair.\"\n\nHeavy shelling is continuing in the Donbas region as Russia seeks to advance towards settlements, including Krasnyy Lyman, Buhayikva, Barvinkove, Lyman and Popasna, the ministry said in its regular bulletin.\n\nZelenskyy: Russia planning independence 'referendum' in Ukraine's south\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of planning to \"falsify\" a \"referendum\" in parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions that are under Russian control. The regions are located to the north of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nZelenskyy urged residents in these areas not to provide their passport numbers or other personal information to Russian forces.\n\n\"This is not to help you ... This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nMoscow has either orchestrated or supported several similar votes in contested areas of Ukraine in recent years, holding a referendum in Crimea after occupying the territory in 2014 and later supporting independence votes held by pro-Russian separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nLuhansk and Donetsk later declared themselves independent \"people's republics,\" a status soon supported by Russia. The two regions are officially recognized as Ukrainian territory by almost every country in the world, despite being under control of the separatists since 2014.\n\n\"Any 'Kherson People's Republics' are not going to fly,\" Zelenskyy said, alluding to the entities established by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\n\"If someone wants a new annexation, it can only lead to new powerful sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nWatch video 26:00 Can the West ever deal again with Putin?\n\nUkraine's Zelenskyy: Mariupol 'continues to resist'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Mariupol \"continues to resist\" despite Moscow's claim to have captured it.\n\n\"In the south and east of our country, the occupiers continue to do everything to have a reason to talk about at least some victories,\" he said in a video address.\n\n\"They can only delay the inevitable \u2014 the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory, in particular Mariupol, a city that continues to resist Russia, despite everything the occupiers say.\"\n\nUN refugee agency: Situation around the world worsening amid Ukraine war\n\nThe UN High Commission for Refugees (UNCHR) said on Friday that the situation of refugees has further worsened due to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"The conflict has further worsened the situation of many of the approximately 84 million displaced people on earth, as food has already become scarcer and significantly more expensive worldwide,\" the acting UNHCR office manager in Germany, Roland Bank, said in remarks published by Germany's Funke Media Group.\n\nBank added that millions of people had already lost their incomes due to the pandemic.

This is where German development cooperation can help in the short term,\" Shulze told Augsburger Allgemeine. \"My ministry has reallocated funds for this via an emergency program.\"\n\nGermany will provide \u20ac37 million (\u20ac40.1 million) for reconstruction in Ukraine, the paper went on to say citing ministry sources.\n\nAround \u20ac22.5 million would go to the reconstruction of Ukraine's power grid, while the remainder would go to the rebuilding of apartments as well as for the acquisition of medical equipment.\n\nWatch video 03:50 US public broadly supports military help for Ukraine: DW's Sumi Somaskanda\n\nZelenskyy: Russia turned down Easter truce offer\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia rejected a proposal for a cease-fire over the Orthodox Christian Easter period.\n\n\"This very well demonstrates how the leaders of this state actually treat the Christian faith, one of the most joyful and important holidays,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"But we keep the hope. Hope for peace, hope that life beats death,\" he added.\n\nZelenskyy's remarks came after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had appealed for a cease-fire during Easter.\n\nUkraine's Orthodox majority celebrate the holiday this weekend, with the Easter service starting late on Saturday into Sunday morning.

It also has pushed Russia to conduct talks on a safe exit for the Ukrainian defenders of the plant, but Moscow has stonewalled the demands.\n\nZelenskyy said he and Erdogan also discussed the course of the negotiation process and possible security guarantees for Ukraine from Turkey and other nations.\n\nErdogan\u2019s office said he told Zelenskyy in their call that Turkey is ready to mediate and assist in talks between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR:\n\n\u2014 Mariupol steel plant under siege; Zelenskyy to meet with U.S. officials\n\n\u2014 Ukrainians mark Orthodox Easter with prayers for those trapped\n\n\u2014 Ukrainian village faces a churchless Easter\n\n\u2014 Sanctions hit Russian economy, though Putin says otherwise\n\n\u2014 Possible mass graves near Mariupol shown in satellite images\n\n\u2014 Follow all AP stories on Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOTHER DEVELOPMENTS:\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis has renewed his call for an Easter truce as Orthodox Christians celebrated Easter Sunday, when the faithful mark the resurrection of Jesus.\n\nWithout naming countries, Francis urged aggressors to \u201cstop the attack to help the suffering of the exhausted people.\u201d\n\nFrancis told a crowd gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square that two months had passed since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and said that \u201cinstead of stopping, the war got worse. It is sad that in these days that are the holiest and most solemn for all Christians, the deadly clamor of arms is louder than the sound of bells announcing the Resurrection.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Switzerland has rejected two requests by Germany to export Swiss ammunition to Ukraine, citing the Alpine nation\u2019s strict neutrality.\n\nThe decision was first reported Sunday by Swiss weekly Sonntagszeitung.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs confirmed that \u201cboth requests from Germany, whether the ammunition received from Switzerland can be passed on to Ukraine, were answered negatively with a reference to Swiss neutrality.\u201d\n\nGermany needs Switzerland\u2019s consent for the arms delivery as part of the original sale contract. The Swiss office declined to specify what type of ammunition Germany had sought to export to Ukraine.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian military says it has struck a Ukrainian explosives factory, several artillery depots and hundreds of other targets.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Sunday that the Russian military used precision-guided missiles to destroy a factory making powder and explosives near Pavlohrad in the Dnipro region in central Ukraine.\n\nKonashenkov said Russian forces also struck several depots with artillery munitions and rockets in Barvinkove, Nova Dmytrivka, Ivanivka, Husarivka and Velyka Komyshuvakha in the Kharkiv region.\n\nHe added that the Russian artillery hit 423 Ukrainian targets overnight, including fortified positions and troops concentrations, while Russian warplanes destroyed 26 Ukrainian military targets.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nISTANBUL \u2014 The spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians has called for the opening of humanitarian corridors in Ukraine, saying a \u201chuman tragedy\u201d was unfolding in the country.\n\nEcumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I spoke Saturday night in Istanbul during midnight mass marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ ahead of Orthodox Easter Sunday.\n\n\u201cLet us ask the Risen Redeemer that this year, (Easter) will be the impetus to open humanitarian corridors, safe passages to truly safe areas for the thousands of people surrounded in Mariupol, civilians, among them the wounded, the elderly, women and many children,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cThe same applies to all other regions of Ukraine, where an indescribable human tragedy is unfolding.\u201d\n\nIstanbul-based Bartholomew is considered first among equals among Eastern Orthodox patriarchs, which gives him prominence but not the power of a Catholic pope.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBERLIN \u2014 The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe says it is extremely concerned about the detention of several Ukrainian members of its monitoring mission in the east of the country.\n\nThe Vienna-based body said in a brief statement Sunday that it is \u201cusing all available channels to facilitate their release.\u201d A spokesperson declined to specify how many national mission members were detained, when or by whom.\n\nSeveral OSCE observers have been killed or injured since the body\u2019s 57 participating states established a mission to monitor the conflict in eastern Ukraine eight years ago. Russia recently vetoed an extension of the mission.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken of hope and victory for his nation during an Easter Sunday address.\n\nSpeaking from the ancient St. Sophia cathedral, Zelenskyy said that \u201cthe great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cthe Lord and the holy heavenly light are on our side,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are going through very difficult ordeals. Let us reach a just end on this path \u2014 the beginning of a happy life and prosperity of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy said that \u201con Easter, we ask God for great grace to make our dream come true \u2013 this is another great day \u2014 the day when great peace will come to Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 A Ukrainian presidential adviser has urged Russia to allow civilians to leave a steel mill in Mariupol besieged by the Russian forces.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appealed to Russia to announce a truce in Mariupol on Orthodox Easter Sunday and immediately open a humanitarian corridor for civilians holed up at the giant Azovstal steel plant. He also challenged Russia to conduct a round of talks to negotiate an exit for the Ukrainian defenders of the plant.\n\nPodolyak tweeted that the Russian military is attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery barrage and is accumulating forces and equipment for an assault.\n\nSviatoslav Palamar, an officer with the Azov Regiment defending the plant, said in a video that on Eastern Sunday the Russians are continuing to shower the plant with bombs and shell it with heavy artillery.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military says Russian forces have continued to press their attacks in the east.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Sunday that the Russians fired on Ukrainian positions along the entire line of contact on the war\u2019s 60th day. It also said the Russian military intensified its offensive and assault operations in the Siverodonetsk, Kurakhiv and Popasna directions.\n\nA regional official in eastern Ukraine says at least eight people have been killed by the Russian shelling.\n\nLuhansk regional Governor Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that two others were wounded by the Russian barrage in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe General Staff added that Russian forces have also continued to pummel the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, hitting it with air strikes, including by long-range aircraft.\n\nThe shelling comes as the Russians are pressing their offensive in a bid to gain full control over Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland called Donbas.\n\nThe Russians have also shelled the Dnipro region west of Donbas, where at least one person was killed by a Russian missile, according to Dnipro regional Governor Valentyn Reznichenko.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military said Saturday it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian military intelligence agency posted a statement saying the command post was hit on Friday and two generals were killed and one was critically wounded.\n\nOleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in an online interview that 50 senior Russian officers were in the command center when it came under attack. He said their fate was unknown.\n\nThe Russian military did not comment on the claim, which could not be confirmed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said new evidence is emerging that shows Russian troops killed tens of thousands of civilians in Mariupol and then tried to cover it up. He said Ukraine has intercepted Russian conversations about \u201chow they are concealing the traces of their crimes.\u201d Satellite images have shown what appear to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nZelenskyy said the Russians set up \u201cfiltration camps\u201d near Mariupol for those trying to leave the city, which has largely been reduced to rubble. He said those who survive these camps are sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East. Many of them, he said, are children.\n\nHe said he spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday about the situation in Mariupol and the general course of the war.\n\nZelenskyy promised to find and punish those responsible for the missile attack on Odesa, which he said killed eight people and wounded 18.\n\nZelenskyy urged Ukrainians to observe a curfew and not attend Orthodox Easter services overnight. The lengthy services traditionally begin late Saturday and run through Sunday morning. \u201cBut starting from 5 a.m. you may go to the church in your city, town or community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSLOVIANSK, Ukraine \u2014 The sound of outgoing artillery and air raid sirens were heard Saturday in Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas that had come under Russian attack the day before.\n\nTwo servicemen were brought to a hospital from a nearby town, but one of them was mortally wounded and could not be saved.\n\nThe Russian strike early Friday had damaged several buildings, including a school.\n\nThe war has brought back painful memories for residents of Sloviansk, where in 2014 Ukrainian government forces repulsed Russia-backed separatists after a fierce battle. In the years since, the separatists maintained control over part of the Donbas, and Moscow has now set out to capture the entire region.\n\nAnna Direnskaya, 70, said she and her son and daughter-in-law decided to remain in Sloviansk.\n\n\u201cI lived through 2014. I was also here. I didn\u2019t go anywhere and I don\u2019t want to go anywhere. I am not hiding from myself,\u201d she said while sitting in a wheelchair outside her damaged apartment building. \u201cI want peace.\u201d\n\nDirenskaya, who like many in eastern Ukraine is a native Russian speaker, said she wishes the Russians would understand that Ukrainians are not bad people and there is no enmity between them.\n\n\u201cWhy did this happen? Why is this happening? I don\u2019t know. Tell everyone I want peace and quiet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s president says he will meet Sunday in Kyiv with the U.S. secretary of state and secretary of defense.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke of the plans Saturday during a press conference. He did not immediately share more detail about the visit from Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Saturday. The U.S. State Department also declined comment.\n\nZelenskyy has for weeks urged Western allies to send Ukraine more weapons to counter the Russian invasion.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland and Ukraine have signed an agreement increasing cooperation in the railway transport sector, aiming to help Ukraine maintain its trade exchange with foreign countries as the Russian invasion affects its ports.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Poland\u2019s premier, Mateusz Morawiecki, met on Saturday in Krakow, Poland.\n\nMorawiecki said on Facebook that they both agreed that current sanctions on Russia are insufficient, which can be seen by the condition of the \u201cRussian currency, bonds or inflation.\u201d They appealed to the international community for tougher steps that would stop Russia\u2019s aggression on Ukraine and for more military aid to help Ukraine.\n\nMorawiecki drew special attention to the plight of civilians seeking protection in a steel plant in Mariupol, as he called for the assistance.\n\n\u201cIn Mariupol soldiers \u2013 or rather Russian criminals want to make women and children starve to death. They are waiting until they run out of water. What kind of strategy is that? This is not war. This is genocide.\u201d\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9",

            "text": "Sergey Karaganov has served as a presidential advisor in the Kremlin both under Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin. He is still considered close to Russia\u2019s president and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. His recent proposals on Russian-speaking minorities in the \u201cnear abroad\u201d are known as \u201cPutin doctrine\u201d and Professor Karaganov, who is honorary chair of the Moscow think tank the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy, was first to come out publicly about an all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2019. President Putin has mentioned on Feb. 24 that Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO warrants Russia\u2019s military intervention to prevent it. However, Ukraine didn\u2019t even have a Membership Action Plan for NATO and Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz clearly stated accession was many, many years off.\n\n\n\nHow can an attack be justified on such grounds?\n\n\u00abFor 25 years people like myself have said that NATO expansion would lead to war. Putin said several times that if it came to Ukraine becoming a member of NATO, there would be no Ukraine anymore. In Bucharest in 2008 there was a plan of quick accession of Ukraine and Georgia to NATO. It was blocked by the efforts of Germany and France, but since that time Ukraine has been integrated into NATO. It was pumped up by weaponry and its troops were trained by NATO, their army getting stronger and stronger day by day. In addition we saw a very rapid increase of neo-Nazi sentiment especially among the military, the society and the ruling elite. It was clear that Ukraine had become something like Germany around 1936-1937. The war was inevitable, they were a spearhead of NATO. We made the very hard decision to strike first, before the threat becomes deadlier\u00bb.\n\nBut Ukraine was not about to become a member of NATO, not for at least many, many years. There was time to negotiate.\n\n\u00abWe have heard all kinds of promises by Western leaders throughout these 30 years. But they lied to us or they forgot about their promises. We were told at the beginning that NATO would not expand\u00bb.\n\nHow can you think a non-nuclear medium-sized country like Ukraine would ever attack a nuclear giant like Russia? And how can you think this is a Nazi country with a Jewish president elected with over 70% of the votes?\n\n\u00abUkraine was being built by the US and other NATO countries as a spearhead, maybe of aggression or at least of military pressure, to bring NATO\u2019s military machine closer to the heart of Russia. We can see now how well their forces had been preparing for a war. And Nazis were not only about killing jews. Nazism is about supremacy of one nation over another. Nazism is humiliation of other nations. The regime and the society in Ukraine were going very much like Germany in the 1930s\u00bb.\n\nYou say that NATO promised never to enlarge to the East and Russia was cheated on that. But former Warsaw Pact countries requested to be included in NATO themselves. And Russia signed up to the Founding Act on Russia-NATO relations in 1997, accepting NATO enlargement. No cheating there.\n\n\u00abIt was the biggest mistake of Russia\u2019s foreign policy in the last 30 years. I fought against it, because the Founding Act of 1997 legitimized further NATO expansion. But we signed it because we were desperately poor and we still were trusting in the wisdom of our partners. President Yeltsin probably thought that we would sneak between drops of rain, to no avail. As for NATO, it was formed as a defensive alliance. But when the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia was weak, I was shocked when I saw the rape of Serbia in 1999. Then we had an absolutely atrocious war in Iraq waged by most of the NATO members and then we had another clear-cut aggression in Libya, always by NATO. So we do not trust words. But we know that article 5 of NATO, stating that an attack on a NATO member is an attack to all, doesn\u2019t work. There is no automatic guarantee that NATO would come to the defense of a member under attack. Please read article 5 of the Treaty. But this enlargement is an enlargement of the aggressive alliance. It\u2019s cancer and we wanted to stop this metastasis. We have to do it by a surgical operation. I regret we were unable to prevent such an outcome\u00bb.\n\nWe all agree the Iraq war was illegitimate and was a very serious mistake. Corriere della Sera came out against that war at the time. But one grave mistake doesn\u2019t justify a second grave mistake. And the US people could elect a new leader, Obama, that was against the Iraq war and changed American policy. Can Russians have an opportunity to do the same?\n\n\u00abI don\u2019t think that in the foreseeable future we will have any change of power in Russia, because we are fighting a war of survival. This is a war with the West and people are regrouping around their leader. This is an authoritarian country and the leadership is always very attentive to the moods of the people. But I don\u2019t see real signs of opposition. Also, in the US or else nobody was really punished for the war in Iraq, so we have our doubts about the effectiveness of democracy\u00bb.\n\nYour parallels don\u2019t seem to match. In Libya, Ghaddafi was bombing protest demonstrations from the sky. NATO enforced a no-fly zone that had been called for by a UN Security Council resolution and Russia did not veto it.\n\n\u00abYes. At that time we believed the reassurances of our Western partners. But then we saw a clear-cut aggression devastating the country. That led us toward total distrust of Western countries, and especially of NATO\u00bb.\n\nAs for the intervention in Yugoslavia in 1999, it was made to stop a war that led to over 10,000 deaths and a UN tribunal charged Milosevic for war crimes, deportation and crimes against humanity.\n\n\u00abThe massive killings in former Yugoslavia happened after the NATO\u2019s rape of Serbia. People were killed on all sides. It was a civil war. It was an unspeakable aggression. And the Milosevic trial was a sad and humiliating show by petty people trying to rationalize their previous mistakes if not crimes\u00bb.\n\n\n\nIt was a UN tribunal, not a EU tribunal.\u00abWe don\u2019t acknowledge the right of that tribunal\u00bb.\n\nYou said that the real war now is against Western expansion. What do you mean?\n\n\u00abWe saw Western expansion happening, we see Russophobia in the West reaching levels like antisemitism between the world wars. So war was already becoming likely. And we saw deep pisions and structural problems within Western societies, so we believed that anyway a war was more and more likely. So the Kremlin decided to strike first. Also, this military operation will be used to restructure Russian elite and Russian society. It will become a more militant-based and national-based society, pushing out non-patriotic elements from the elite\u00bb.\n\nThe bottom line question is: Mussolini did not recognize the international order that emerged from the Versailles Treaty in 1919. Does the Kremlin recognize the legitimacy of the European order that emerged from the fall of the Berlin Wall? Do you think this order is legitimate?\u00abWe should not recognize the order that was built against Russia. We tried to integrate in it but we saw it was a Versailles system number 2. I wrote that we had to destroy it. Not by force, but through constructive destruction, through refusal to participate in it. But after the last demand to stop NATO was again rejected, it was decided to use force\u00bb.\n\nSo the overall goal of this war is to overturn the presence of NATO in central and eastern European countries?\n\n\u00abWe see that most of the institutions are, in our view, one-sided and illegitimate. They are threatening Russia and Eastern Europe. We wanted fair peace, but the greed and stupidity of the Americans and the short-sightedness of the Europeans revealed they didn\u2019t want that. We have to correct their mistakes\u00bb.\n\nIs the EU part of the institutions that Russia feels are illegitimate?\n\n\u00abNo, it\u2019s legitimate. But sometimes we dislike EU policies, especially if they become more and more belligerent\u00bb.\n\n\n\nYou seem to believe that an escalation of this war to other countries is inevitable. Is that what you are saying?\n\n\u00abUnfortunately it is becoming more and more likely. Americans and their NATO partners continue support of Ukraine by sending arms. If that continues, it is obvious that targets in Europe could or will be hit in order to stop lines of communications. Then the war could escalate. At this juncture it is becoming more and more plausible. I think the Joint chiefs of staff of US armed forces are of the same opinion as I am\u00bb.\n\nDenazification is what Ukraine seems to have proven by electing a Jewish president. Demilitarization is the opposite of what Mr. Putin has achieved, as this attack led Ukraine to get heavy weaponry from the West. Plus, Germany and the EU are rearming too, NATO has moved troops closer to Russia\u2019s borders, Western sanctions are now much tighter, while Europe and the US got closer together and Russia is becoming financially isolated. Would you say Putin\u2019s military operation is proving a success, so far?\n\n\u00abNazism is not only about antisemitism. It is about hating and suppressing all other nationalities. And it was taking over Ukraine. We never know how the military operations end. Demilitarization means destruction of Ukrainian military forces \u2013 that is happening and will accelerate. Of course, if Ukraine is supported with new weapons, that could prolong the agony. We can only talk about \u201cvictory\u201d in quotes, because there are many casualties on both the Russian and the Ukrainian side. The war will be victorious, in one way or another. I assume demilitarization will be achieved and there will be denazification, too. Like we did in Germany and in Chechnya. Ukrainians will become much more peaceful and friendly to us\u00bb.\n\nBut so far the Russian military had to withdraw after keeping Kiev under siege for one month. It doesn\u2019t look like the military operation is going so well, does it?\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s a large military operation, so it has secrets in the way it\u2019s waged. What if the Kiev operation was meant to distract Ukrainian forces and keep them away from the main theater in the South and South-East? Maybe that was the plan. Moreover Russian troops have been very careful not to hit civilian targets, we used only 30-35% of the lethal weapons that we could use. If we had used everything, that would have meant the destruction of Ukrainian cities and a much quicker victory. We did not do carpet bombing like Americans in Iraq. The endgame probably will be a new treaty, maybe with Zelensky still there. Probably it would mean the creation of a country in South and South-East Ukraine that is friendly to Russia. Maybe there will be several Ukraines. But at this juncture it is impossible to predict because, of course, it\u2019s an open-ended story. We are in the fog of war\u00bb.\n\n\n\nThere is clear evidence that civilians have been targeted and killed by the Russian in Mariupol, in Bucha and elsewhere. These look very much like war crimes and crimes against humanity and they were deliberate. Should they be persecuted?\n\n\u00abThe Bucha story is completely fake-staged, it\u2019s a provocation\u00bb.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look staged at all.\n\n\u00abI watched the pictures and I am 99% sure. But more in general there is a war and civilians suffer. We know that Ukrainian neoNazi forces have been using civilians as living shields, especially in Mariupol. We have different pictures with you\u00bb.\n\nIt\u2019s rather the opposite: the Russian army did not allow humanitarian corridors.\n\n\u00abWe opened them. They were blocked by nationalist forces. I know how our military operates but, of course, this is a war. We face a tragedy\u00bb.\n\nDid you expect this level of cohesion between Europe and the US?\n\n\u00abWell, the cohesion will collapse because of the problems of the West. But for the time being they were organizing even before this conflict. The West is failing and losing its position in the world, so it needs an enemy \u2013 for the moment we are the enemy. I don\u2019t think the unity will last, Europe will not commit the suicide by choosing to lose its independence. I hope our European neighbors will recuperate from this dizziness of hatred\u00bb.\n\nYou speak like some other country started this war, in fact Russia started it.\n\n\u00abI was not for this particular scenario, but it happened. And I support my country. The West committed several aggressions. We are now on the same moral level, we are equal, we are doing more or less like you. I regret that we lost our moral superiority. But we are fighting an existential war\u00bb.\n\nSanctions are getting tighter. Will Russia become more dependent on China?\n\n\u00abThere is no question about that: we will be more integrated and more dependent on China. It has positive elements but overall we will be much more dependent. I am not very much afraid of becoming a pawn of China like some EU states became pawns of the US. First, Russians have a core gene of sovereignty. Second, we are culturally different from the Chinese, I don\u2019t think that China could or would like to overtake us. However we are not happy with the situation, because I would have preferred to have better relations with Europe. But Chinese are our close allies and friends and the biggest source of Russian strength after Russian people themselves. We are a source of their strength. I would prefer to end this confrontation with Europe. My calculation was to create a safe Western flank to compete more effectively In the Asian world of tomorrow\u00bb.\n\nYou declared that China, not Russia, will emerge as the victor in this war. What did you mean?\n\n\u00abWe will be victorious because Russians always are in the end. But in the meantime we will lose a lot. We will lose people. We will lose financial resources and we will become poorer for the time being. But we are ready to sacrifice in order to build a more viable and fair international system. We are talking about Ukraine, but we really want to build a different international system than the one that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union and, in turn, is now collapsing. We all are sinking into chaos now. We would like to build Fortress Russia to defend ourselves from this chaos, even if we are getting poorer for this. Unfortunately the chaos could take over Europe, if Europe doesn\u2019t act according to its interests. What Europe is doing right now is absolutely suicidal\u00bb.\n\nIs that a threat? Don\u2019t you think nuclear deterrence still applies?\n\n\u00abI know that officially under certain circumstances the US could use nuclear weapons for the defense of Europe and they allegedly could fight for the defense of Europe against a nuclear superpower. There is a 1% chance this might happen, so we have to be careful. But if a n American president takes such a decision inviting devastating response it would mean he is insane\u00bb.\n\nThis war doesn\u2019t look sustainable, including for Russia. It can\u2019t go on for long. What are the elements to agree at least on a real ceasefire?\n\n\u00abFirst, Ukraine must be a completely demilitarized neutral country \u2013 no heavy arms, for whatever of Ukraine remains. This should be guaranteed by outside powers, including Russia, and no military exercises should take place in the country if one of the guarantors is against it. Ukraine should be a peaceful buffer, hopefully sending back some of the arms systems deployed in recent years\u00bb.\n\nUkraine needs security guarantees, it needs to be able to defend itself or it will not be a sovereign country anymore.\n\n\u00abI am sorry but Italy and most European countries cannot defend themselves either\u00bb.\n\nThey belong to NATO\u2026\n\n\u00abThey have been saving on security. That is how they got themselves into this awkward position that Europe is not considered to be a serious actor in the world. Switzerland and Austria are neutral, but are safe. So can Ukraine\u00bb.\n\nDo you realize that after what you just said, the debate in Italy will move towards investing more on defense?\n\n\u00abYou are welcome. One of the grave mistakes of the Europeans in the last decades is that they didn\u2019t invest in their security, under their ideal of eternal peace. But I think European nations should be able to defend themselves, because they have real threats coming from the South and the world is becoming a very dangerous place as international relations are collapsing. The question is more against whom Italy would like to arm. Against Russia? Well, that would be insane. But you need a more robust military force. You are living in a very dangerous place in the world. If you depend on America, you are selling out your own security and sovereignty because the Americans have their own interests\u00bb.\n\nThe EU seems to be moving towards cutting dependence from Russian energy \u2013 first coal, then oil and finally natural gas. Did you expect that?\n\n\u00abI hope you are not suicidal. Of course that would damage Russia, too, but Europe would undermine its economy and its social situation. I hope it will not happen, because you can calculate your own interests. If you don\u2019t want our coal, we will sell it somewhere else. If you don\u2019t want our oil, after a time and some losses, we will sell it elsewhere. And if you don\u2019t want gas, well, well, we can also eventually redirect it after some suffering. Russians support Putin at 81% now, people are ready for a rough period\u00bb.\n\nDo you think Italy and Europe could do something to broker a deal?\n\n\u00abNot easy, given the situation. But what they could do is try to stop this Russophobia, akin anti-semitism of the previous centuries, this satanization of Russia that would lead us eventually to a worse confrontation than we have now. Even Russian culture is being erased in Europe by a new cancel culture\u00bb.\n\nFrom our partner RIAC",

The effort will feature mobile billboards displaying photos from Ukrainian cities that will be sent to various locations.\n\nMorawiecki has also said he would himself travel to EU capitals to remind decision makers \u201cwhat is happening in Ukraine.\u201d The campaign, which will also include social media posts, according to the prime minister, \u201chas to contribute decisively to ensuring that Europe is not a Europe of indifference, helplessness, that it is not a Europe of defeat,\u201d he has added. Nations in western and southern Europe are willing to return to \u201cnormality\u201d too \u201csoon,\u201d Morawiecki has said, adding that the campaign is aimed at \u201cawakening the conscience\u201d of the bloc.\n\nPhotos placed on the mobile billboards by the Polish authorities juxtapose the devastation of Ukrainian cities against peaceful life in Europe.

Nothing special is happening there,\u201d he said, adding that restrictions might have some effect, but only in the long run.\n\nMorawiecki then called for \u201ccrushing sanctions \u2026 much stronger than those that have been imposed.\u201d The move comes as Washington and Brussels are reportedly discussing sanctions designed to hit Russia\u2019s energy sector. So far, Western nations have mostly targeted Russian finances and banking, while the EU has also banned Russia\u2019s coal imports.\n\nWhile the US introduced a total ban on energy from Russia, which was echoed by Canada, Australia, and Japan, EU member states have been split on the matter. Many European nations largely dependent on Russia\u2019s energy imports opposed an outright immediate ban on Russian oil and gas.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned in March that cutting off such imports immediately could cause \u201cmass unemployment, poverty, people who can\u2019t heat their homes.\u201d Austria admitted on Saturday that it simply cannot afford to ban imports of Russian gas.\n\nEven the US has been cautious about the possibility of an EU-wide oil and gas embargo against Russia, arguing it could drastically increase global oil prices and harm economies in Europe and beyond.\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.",

He was already scheduled to go to Moscow to see Putin and Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. On the trip, Guterres and staff members plan to discuss stepping up humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians affected by the war, the UN said.\n\nRussia Says 1 Dead, 27 Missing in Moskva Sinking (10:37 p.m.)\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry said one sailor died and 27 people remain missing after last week\u2019s sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet. Russia says the ship sank in a storm while it was being towed back to port after fires broke out on board.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military says the ship, whose normal crew was thought to be close to 500, sunk after being hit by Neptune missiles.

Michel, who chairs EU summits, believes Putin\u2019s entourage doesn\u2019t brief him fully about events, according to the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss confidential talks.\n\nMichel told Putin that the Russian leader had been wrong about his expectations that the war would last 48 hours, divide EU members and fail to trigger heavy economic sanctions. According to the Kremlin\u2019s readout, Putin reiterated Moscow\u2019s public line, criticizing what it called \u201cirresponsible statements of EU officials on the need to resolve the situation in Ukraine militarily\u201d and the bloc\u2019s \u201cignoring of numerous war crimes by Ukrainian forces.\u201d\n\nEstonia Wards Off Cyber-Attacks With Links to Russian Hackers (5:23 p.m.)\n\nEstonia has fended off a wave of cyber-attacks believed to be launched by a pro-Kremlin hacker group targeting Ukraine supporters. Around 700 million denial-of-service attacks mainly from outside of Europe were launched against the websites of the Estonian president, foreign ministry, police and public services agencies on Thursday and Friday, the Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team said.\n\nThe impact has so far been minimal, the authority said. The website of a NATO cybersecurity center in Estonia, which this week hosted a global exercise with 2,000 participants from 32 countries, was among the websites that were temporarily down. The pro-Kremlin hacker group Killnet has claimed to be behind the attacks, a military spokeswoman said on Friday.\n\nHalliburton Says It Must End Some Deals in Russia by May 15 (5:13 p.m.)\n\nHalliburton Co. said that sanctions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other nations require the company to wind down certain contracts in Russia by May 15.\n\nThe company also said that the total net book value of its assets in Russia is about $340 million, and warned the invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions could cause the company to take a charge related to those assets.\n\nEU Suggests Companies Should Keep Paying for Russia Gas in Euros (5:03 p.m.)\n\nThe European Union has suggested that companies could keep paying for gas in euros, as it published guidance that Moscow\u2019s decree calling for payment in rubles would violate sanctions.\n\nThe commission confirmed a preliminary assessment that the decree would run against European sanctions imposed on Russia. It also said the decree doesn\u2019t automatically preclude allowing companies to continue paying in euros, and the scope for exemptions is not yet clear. The commission advised companies to seek confirmation from Moscow that this was possible.\n\nU.S. Leaves World Bank-IMF Meeting in Protest as Russia Speaks (4:46 p.m.)\n\nOfficials representing the U.S., Germany, Japan, and other nations walked out of a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund gathering on Friday when Russia\u2019s envoy started speaking, the second such action at a high-profile gathering in Washington this week, people familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe representatives were attending a meeting of the institution\u2019s development committee, according to the people, who declined to be identified because the gathering is private. The committee is a ministerial-level forum of the World Bank and the IMF for intergovernmental consensus-building on development issues and has 25 members, usually ministers of finance or development, according to its website.\n\nRussia Faces \u2018Reverse Industrialization\u2019 Amid Sanctions (2:11 p.m.)\n\nRussia faces a deep and prolonged economic contraction along with higher inflation and reduced living standards, as sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies sap it of vital products and technology, according to economists at the central bank.\n\nIn its most detailed public statement on the outlook since the war started, the Bank of Russia warned that \u201cthe depth of the contraction may be quite significant and exit trajectory drawn out in time\u201d because the supply shocks triggered by sanctions are unlikely to fade quickly. It said Russia would experience \u201creverse industrialization\u201d as sanctions forced it to seek lower-tech replacements for western goods that were cut off.\n\nGeneral Says Kremlin Seeks Full Control of Southern Ukraine (11:04 a.m.)\n\nA top general said the Kremlin aims to secure control of the entire south of Ukraine as well as the eastern Donbas region, Russia\u2019s state-run Tass and RIA Novosti reported.\n\nMajor General Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Central Military District, spoke in Ekaterinburg. It\u2019s unclear whether his statements reflect official Kremlin objectives.\n\nRussia wants to create a land bridge to Crimea as well to influence key aspects of Ukraine\u2019s economy, including major Black Sea ports, he said. Ultimately the Kremlin wants access to Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria, which lies to the northwest of Odesa.\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "text": "\u00a9 Getty Images / simon2579 via RT\n\nMandelaw Bageru\n\nmandelawb@gmail.com\n\nFormed in the aftermath of World War II, NATO is a military alliance built on the principle of collective defense \u2014 meaning that all NATO countries agree to come to the defense of any individual member that comes under attack. Russia considers NATO to be a direct threat, and Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the possibility that Ukraine might join motivated his decision to launch the Russian invasion. Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry has also warned of serious military and political consequences if Sweden and Finland join the alliance. All these three countries are lately seeking to do that.\n\nSo is it worth provoking Putin and Russia to add Ukraine, Sweden, and Finland into the NATO alliance club? This issue requires serious look beyond the current hasty phobia-led and unequal political standing among nations.\n\nRussia\u2019s NATO-coerced invasion of parts of Eastern Ukraine has brought the dangerous likelihood of nuclear war into a new contemporary global political focus. Sadly, in response to the Russo-Ukraine protracted war crisis, many countries are opting to boost their respective military spending, much to the delight of weapons contractors and the arms industry. Even more alarming are the calls for increased investments in nuclear capabilities by nuclear-armed states, and the calls for deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons into countries that currently do not host them.\n\nIt is clearly known for generations how the four-pronged phobias have been causing inequality among global nations, simply rooted in erroneously perceived generalities of: (a) Russo-phobia, (b) Sino-phobia (c) Islam-phobia and (d) Afro-phobia. These phobic and irrational attitudes can easily trigger the jeopardy for nuclear bomb possibilities and the 3rd world war to occur suddenly.\n\nNuclear Bomb Proliferation and Flexing for Fight\n\nIt has been proven time and time again that on its own nuclear weapon can upset and/or destroy a city, by killing hundreds of thousands or even millions of people.\n\nFor instance, according to NukeMap:\n\nIf the largest Russian nuclear bomb were to be dropped on New York City, then over eight million people would be killed, and another nearly seven million injured. The U.S. already has an estimated one hundred nuclear weapons in Europe. Five NATO countries \u2014 Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Germany \u2014 take part in a nuclear sharing arrangement, each hosting twenty U.S. nuclear weapons. Germany, in addition to hosting U.S. nukes, is also ramping up its military spending to the tune of 100 billion Euros. In a major shift in German policy, the country has committed to spending more than 2% of its GDP on the military. Germany has also committed to buying US-made F-35 aircraft \u2014 jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons \u2014 to replace its own Tornado fighter jets. In Poland, a country that borders Ukraine and Russian ally \u2013 Belarus, does not have any nuclear weapons, yet, the leader of the ruling right-wing national-conservative Law and Justice Party says they are now \u201copen\u201d to the US putting nuclear weapons there.\n\nThe nuclear fever isn\u2019t just in Europe. China is accelerating its nuclear buildup amidst the rising fears of conflicts with the U.S.A \u2014 with Taiwan as a forthcoming flashpoint. On its part, China plans to build one hundred land-based nuclear missile silos, and a Pentagon report claims they\u2019ll have one thousand nuclear warheads by the end of the decade. This will add to the nearly thirteen thousand nuclear weapons that already exist globally. China is also nearing completion of its own nuclear triad \u2014 the ability to launch nuclear weapons by land, sea, and air \u2014 which, according to conventional wisdom, would secure its nuclear deterrence strategy.\n\nAdditionally, North Korea has restarted its ICBM program and recently launched a test missile for the first time since 2017. North Korea claims the missile to be a \u201cpowerful nuclear war deterrent,\u201d the same rationale every other nuclear-armed country uses for building and maintaining nuclear weapons.\n\nU.S. allies in the region aren\u2019t immune to the calls for nuclear weapons. Influential former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, who has long pushed for a more militarized Japan, recently called for the country to consider hosting U.S. nuclear weapons \u2014 despite Japan being the only place on Earth to know firsthand the horror wrought directly onto people by a nuclear-weapons attack. Luckily, the comments received pushback from current leader Fumio Kishida, who called the idea \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nBut too many leaders are not responsibly resisting the call for more nuclear weapons. Rather, neighboring countries to Russia like Finland, Sweden and others in the region are in hurry to be admitted into the NATO-Forces-Club in an attempt to squeeze Russia out of shape.\n\nOn his part, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, besides his calls for a No-Fly Zone, he recently told 60 Minutes: \u201cThe world is saying today that some people are politically hiding behind claims that \u2018we cannot stand up for Ukraine because there could be a nuclear war\u2026believing that by not helping Ukraine, you will hide from Russian nukes. I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019\u201d Zelensky appears to suggest that no matter if the West engages in a direct conventional military confrontation with Russia or not, a nuclear confrontation is a foregone conclusion. Zelensky\u2019s language that implies unavoidable nuclear attacks and a necessity for increased military intervention only pushes Russia closer to launching a nuclear attack \u2014 and the world toward a global nuclear war. This is not a path that Ukraine or the world should want to take. What is needed is more diplomacy.\n\nThe U.S. hasn\u2019t made things better. Instead, it is blatantly refusing to adopt \u201cno first use\u201d as official policy, the same nuclear policy shared by Russia \u2014 a policy that is striking fear across the globe right now, including majority of people in the U.S. who are now worried about a nuclear attack. This is doubly alarming considering the U.S.\u2019s history of fabricating evidence to go to war, as happened with George W. Bush\u2019s lies about WMDs in Iraq and the falsified Gulf of Tonkin incident that was used as a pretext to escalate the Vietnam War.\n\nCredibility of the Human Rights Council\n\nOn 7 April the UN General Assembly (GA) decided to suspend Russia\u2019s membership in the Human Rights Council. This hasty action establishes a destructive precedent not only for the future of the Human Rights Council, but also for the future of other United Nations institutions\u2019 existence and exercises around the globe. This biased action doesn\u2019t promote transparency. Rather, it challenges the idea that a few powerful countries can tank not only the Security Council initiatives but also the GA, without much is justified as a consensus or an explanation.\n\nObviously, this undigested hurried move was a big blow to Russia\u2019s prestige at the UN-forums, and adds bad precedence to the latent yet general atmosphere of Russo-phobia provoked by NATO pact hooligans. In the past we have seen similar collective actions imposed on a number of nations as well. This sets supremacy attitudes in the future in which unbalanced efforts will be made to exclude other countries from membership in the Human Rights Council too.\n\nIf the political trail is managed fairly, then, one could think of excluding several NATO countries or even NATO itself as an entity, for the war crimes and crimes committed against humanity by NATO forces during the wars of aggression against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and former Yugoslavia. Incidentally, one could think of excluding the UK for having extended its colonial arms invisibly through Saudi Arabia because of the protracted civil war committed in intensifying civil strife among ethnic groups in Yemen; or between Pakistan and India for its systematic war crimes and gross violations of human rights against the people of Kashmir, including widespread extra-judicial executions.\n\nAnother credible candidate for suspension would have been Azerbaijan because of its aggression against the unfortunate Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh during the Blitzkrieg of September-November 2020, where war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed, including torture and execution of Armenian prisoners of war. We could think of excluding for using its puppet regimes forcibly appointed in Colombia to carryout lethal para-military activities and consistent pattern of killing human rights defenders, social activist leaders, syndicalist and indigenous peoples.\n\nThus, it is not worth shedding popular tears over the UN Human Rights Council, whose authority and credibility are seriously jeopardized and still remain questionable; and whose resolutions are routinely ignored by many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel. Since its formation in 2006 the Human Rights Council has not served human rights well \u2013 but it has certainly served the geopolitical and informational interests of the global expansionist club members including, but not limited to, United States, the European Union, and the NATO alliance member countries.\n\nThe GA decision also puts a further nail on the coffin of the UN-General Assembly itself. It manifests how this Assembly can and is manipulated by the United States and by the bullying, arm-twisting and blackmailing practices of the Department of State. Countries have been overtly told to: \u201cTake the US-NATO way, or else, take the highway.\u201d\n\nFar more serious for the world are the economic sanctions and financial blockade imposed by the US and EU countries on Russia, which will have a long-lasting impact on the world economy, hurting the most vulnerable not only in Russia, but also in Europe, Africa, North and South America, and Asia.\n\nThe decision of the UN-General Assembly (GA) sets a dangerous precedent and further politicizes the Human Rights Council. One would think that precisely because some countries do not like what Russia is doing that they would like to \u201ctame\u201d it by involving it in the human rights work of the Council. Isolating a country is always counter-productive. What is needed is greater inclusion and greater debate \u2013 not exclusion and hate-mongering. In this respect, the GA vote illustrates the success of the \u201cinformation war\u201d that has been waged against Russia for decades \u2013 not just since 2022, not even since 2014 and the Maidan coup \u2013 long before there was systematic dis-information about Russia and a consistent negative narrative. This has a simple explanation: NATO has had no raison d\u2019\u00eatre since the Warsaw Pact was dismantled in 1991. In order to continue existing, NATO must have an \u201cenemy\u201d \u2013 and that is the only role that the US and NATO assigned to Russia. The Russian bogeyman is necessary and guarantees that the US military-industrial-financial complex can continue its war on the world and on the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n\nSignals Put Before the General Assembly\n\nThe allegations of war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces in Bucha in the vicinity of Kiev precipitated this move by the US to have Russia removed from the Human Rights Council. How much do we know about the events? While Ukraine accused Russia of murdering 400 civilians in Bucha before retreating from the town, the Russian government has refuted these allegations, pointing out that Russian forces withdrew in an orderly fashion on 30 March and that no allegations of extra judicial executions were made until 2 April 2022, four days later, when Ukrainian security forces and TV cameras arrived in Bucha. The US and NATO accepted Kiev\u2019s claims uncritically and used them to justify imposing further sanctions against Russia. However, serious doubts have arisen about a possible staged events and tampering with the photos and videos. After all, fake news has been in the global arena sawing intentionally spread misinformation propaganda news in recent decades since the war in Iraq.\n\nSo the serious question is: Do we have here another false flag operation as we have seen multiple times in Iraq Syria and Libya, staged chemical attacks that could not be confirmed by expert inspectors? Are the dead persons\u2019 civilians or military? Were the bodies of those of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian-civilian-victims of artillery bombardment? Were the bodies Russian soldiers wearing white armbands or Ukrainian civilians with white armbands to signal their peaceful intentions and subsequently lynched by Ukrainian extremists for collaboration with the Russians? One day we may find out whether the US had advance knowledge of the alleged crimes in Bucha or whether it was involved in manufacturing fake evidence for the information and psychological warfare. Of course, nobody knows. What we need is whistleblowers, more like Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. The classical mass media is no longer trustworthy; it has been long time since it proved to stage fake news even utilizing its social media wing.\n\nAn international commission of inquiry should investigate, but that will take time, because the evidence on the ground (to the extent it has not been destroyed) must be evaluated and witnesses on all sides must be heard. Gradually some information is coming out that does not confirm Ukrainian claims, and in a series of recorded satellite phone calls, a reporter identified as \u201cSimon\u201d tells his colleagues that at Borodyanka \u201cthere\u2019s no bodies in the streets at all\u201d, contrary to what he had been led to believe.\n\nApparently the town had been \u201cshelled to pieces\u201d, but it is not clear whether this was committed by Russian or Ukrainian artillery. In any event, Simon concluded \u201cthere is no evidence of any rights abuses here\u201d. Simon and his crew interviewed residents who reported that the Russian soldiers had been correct and given them food, water and other supplies. Simon concluded: \u201cI do not know what the prosecutor was talking about, but we have seen nothing like that. It is a completely different picture.\u201d An international investigation is justified and necessary, but any ad hoc commission must investigate allegations of crimes committed not only by Russian soldiers but also by Ukrainian soldiers and para-militaries, in particular against the Russian-Ukrainians of Lugansk and Donetsk since 2014, and the pogrom against 50 Russian-Ukrainians in Odessa in May 2014.\n\nTherefore, it could be said without fear of contradiction, that the GA vote was prematurely orchestrated hasty and coercive and cursive drama that left an added failure by this global entity. Sad enough, the GA violated the general principles of law concerning due process to be followed and the presumption of innocence. Above all, with due respect, the GA must have given the floor and the opportunity to entertain Russia\u2019s evidence and arguments and given due weight for conflict triggering matters with all fairness. The absence of due process is yet another disgrace for the General Assembly to gang up and take irrational, persuasive, hooligan type of nosy decision making forum without having any evidence put forward from either side to backstop its hasty resolution.\n\nThe UN-General Assembly\u2019s Double Standards\n\nThis is not the first and will not be the last time that the UN-General Assembly (GA) applies double standards and adopts flawed resolutions or decisions simply to please The USA, EU and the NATO alliance. It seems like the entire United Nations system has been hijacked by the West and has the full support of a homologated corporate media that acts as the echo chamber of the State Department.\n\nAnother example of shaky-double-standards and selective indignation: The International Criminal Court. We hear politicians demand a \u201cNuremberg\u201d Trial against Putin. Well, why not a Tribunal to investigate and condemn the crimes of aggression committed by Bill Clinton in Yugoslavia, by George W. Bush and Tony Blair in Iraq, by Barack Obama in Libya, Syria and Ukraine (after all, Obama was president when the \u201cno fly\u201d zone over Libya was manipulated for \u201cregime change\u201d. Worldwide, it has been recalled Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous words: \u201cWe came, we saw, he died\u201d.\n\nAny tribunal show should clearly investigate the crimes committed by Ukrainian sharp-shooters at Maidan in connection with the 2014 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the democratically elected President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovich. Was it not the legitimate legal duty or responsibility of the International Criminal Court also to investigate and prosecute the NATO forces from the US, UK, Germany, and Australia, who committed atrocities in Afghanistan and Iraq? How about the torture centers used in clandestine in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay? How about the use of indiscriminate weapons including depleted uranium weapons, white phosphorus and cluster bombs, causing tens of thousands of deaths? How about all the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d visited upon civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya?\n\nWhere is the accountability for all of these crimes? The International Criminal Court will not have any credibility until it decides to apply the Statute of Rome seriously and go after the likes of George W. Bush and Joe Biden. Hitherto the West has \u201cgotten away with it\u201d \u2013 but for how long? Will the ICC remain in the service of the West, as a strong arm of the Pentagon? Hitherto we have observed the culture of impunity that protects Western leaders. Will the rule of law ever evolve into the rule of justice? This is the real unanswered question that remains in limbo.\n\nInternational Court of Justice (ICC)\n\nEstablished in 2002 by the Rome Statute, the ICC has 123 member states where it can investigate and prosecute crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and state acts of aggression. (Ukraine has also not formally joined the court, but has submitted to its jurisdiction in the past.\n\nInternational court of Justice (ICC) affairs, after World War II, the prominent Nuremberg trials, led by the U.S. and allied powers, prosecuted Nazi war criminals. The U.S. has also backed international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone, which have held high-ranking individuals accountable for terrible crimes.\n\nBut the trouble to put the ICC into effective appliance of justice is when a state is too powerful to be bound by ICC\u2019s demands and decisions. The problem isn\u2019t about the absence of globally assured law but rather its breakdown, when states refuse to comply and aren\u2019t held accountable. This can further inflame conflicts unequal treatment of weaker nations in front of the ICC. The resulting pattern of war, displacement, and rampant human rights violations we\u2019re seeing in Ukraine has tragically become all too familiar due to the provocation of the 30 NATO pact members due to the Russophobes and their hooligan actions to squeeze and suffocate the Russian Republics and its citizens. So Russia had to protect itself before NATO takes over Ukraine against the treatment it signed in previous years.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not just Russia that seems not to pay attention to what the ICC rules and regulations are all about. Since the recent past, side-lining the ICC is true of the USA as well.\n\nFirstly, when President Bill Clinton signed the Rome Statute, he advised against U.S. ratification out of concern that the court could assert jurisdiction over U.S. officials and service members. Secondly, President George W. Bush then famously \u201cunsigned\u201d the Rome Statute less than one year before his illegal invasion of Iraq. Thirdly, when the Trump administration went so far as to sanction ICC prosecutors who were investigating possible U.S. crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nThe most powerful nations like U.S., China, Russia, India, etc., should have set exemplary relationships with the ICC \u2014 and the global rule of law more broadly. Yet on its part, the ICC is more tilted to the Western powers and active in helping the USA and NATO pact members in their intervention to upset weaker nations in their own rights than to sand firm equally to all its members with due respect and fairness.\n\nLooking at a resolution now in the USA Congress introduced by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) that calls for the U.S. to join the ICC, it is certain this will also be side lined as business as usual. That means, another resolution is required to repeal the 2002 law that prohibits the U.S. A\u2019s support for ICC investigations.\n\nIn principle, no country should stand in the way of accountability and remedy for global victims of conflict, whether in Ukraine, Palestine, Yemen, or elsewhere. This includes the United States, which must also reckon with its own crimes committed during the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine.\n\nUsually, Washington has been seeking supremacy by imposing ad hoc rules by masking itself under the mantle of human rights violation, humanitarian aids, and violation of international law. These are systematically devised excuses meant to advance both the US and NATO\u2019s joint militaristic interests at the cost of upsetting lives and livelihoods in Ukraine and elsewhere around the globe.\n\n\u201cWe cannot successfully cooperate with the rest of the world in establishing a reign of law,\u201d warned Robert H. Jackson, the chief U.S. prosecutor at Nuremberg, \u201cunless we are prepared to have that law sometimes operate against what would be our national advantage.\u201d\n\nFrom the outset, it was clear, Russia is among the nations who would not submit itself to Washington\u2019s will of global dominance. Instead, Russia, China and India are working hard to strengthen efforts aimed at the Non-allied nations\u2019 forum for power balance. In this regard, just like China, Russia is fighting to be part of an international community of equals and will not allow Western nations to ignore its legitimate security concerns which it attempted to clarify far ahead of the NATO proxy attempt to expand itself into Ukraine and further squeeze Russia outside of the global political and economic arena. In self-defense, Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine is meant to put an end to NATO\u2019s regional domination as well as the US-dominated world order.\n\nThe answer to the threat of nuclear weapons is not more nuclear weapons. The answer is a planet that engages in genuine disarmament with a goal of no nuclear weapons. The answer is to strengthen an international community of equals that will not easily consent Western nations to ignore their respective legitimate security concerns nationally and regionally.\n\nYet, Law alone won\u2019t deliver global justice. But if we want fewer wars, more diplomacy, and more international cooperation, then no country can remain above it.\n\n__\n\n\n\n\n\nTo publish article on borkena, please send a submission to info@borkena.com for consideration.\n\nJoin the conversation.

            "text": "Former President Dmitry Medvedev's opinion article in the daily Kommersant in October 2021, ahead of Russia's massive military buildup along the Ukrainian border, was as surreal as it was acerbic.\n\nMedvedev, who owes his political career and his seemingly enormous wealth to Russian President Vladimir Putin, lashed out at Ukraine's leaders, calling them \"weak,\" \"nonindependent,\" and corrupt and adding there was no sense in negotiating with them.\n\nIn the article, which Western analysts described as \"chauvinistic,\" Medvedev described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, as beholden to \"the most rabid nationalist forces\" and accused him of \"completely chang[ing]\" his political and moral compass.\n\n\"One can only imagine how revolting it was for [Zelenskiy] to commit such a moral somersault,\" he said in the October 11 commentary.\n\nTo many Kremlin observers, Medvedev could have been talking about himself.\n\nThe 56-year-old former lawyer once represented the hopes of Russian liberals seeking democratic change. When Putin picked him to become president in 2008, many put doubts about the motives of the senior partner in the ruling \"tandem\" aside and latched onto the idea that reforms were in the offing.\n\nNearly 15 years later, a different Medvedev jumps out from the page. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 and has remained in the Kremlin ever since, steadily shutting the door on dissent and bringing the country into increasing confrontation with Kyiv and the West.\n\nAnd in recent months, as Putin narrowed his inner circle to a handful of hard-liners, launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, and taken the clampdown in Russia to new levels, Medvedev has done a flip -- at least verbally -- to stay in his patron's good graces.\n\nThe October commentary was one of several caustic articles, social-media posts, or remarks that Medvedev has issued in recent months, some of them echoing the outlandish kind of historical revisionism that Putin has used to vilify the West and underpin the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBellicose Name-Calling\n\nIn Russia's current bilious climate, with officials, lawmakers, and state TV guests seemingly vying to top one another in terms of belligerence, they may not seem outlandish. But they sharply contrast with Medvedev's established image as a mild-mannered, iPhone-toting technocrat.\n\n\"It's not so much the content. It's the tone -- the name calling. I don't remember Medvedev being like that earlier in his career,\" Brian Taylor, a professor of political science at Syracuse University who focuses on Russian politics, told RFE/RL. He said that Medvedev -- who lost a lot of power and influence when he was ousted as prime minister two years ago -- is trying to \"stay relevant\" politically.\n\nIn a March social-media post, Medvedev compared Polish, Slovak, and Czech leaders traveling by train to Kyiv to show support to Zelenskiy -- a transportation choice dictated by Russia's war in Ukraine -- to Vladimir Lenin's return trip to Russia from self-imposed exile in 1917, ahead of the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nMedvedev claimed that the Polish elite suffers from Russophobia due to anger over having lost control of the throne in Moscow 400 years ago -- an assertion that ignores far greater and more recent factors, such as the decades of repressive Soviet dominance over Poland and its neighbors.\n\nTimothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University who is an author and an expert on the region, called the post \"grotesque\" and said that Medvedev was trying to position himself as a populist speaking for ordinary citizens in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"But he is himself a caricature of the global elite, wealthy for no reason, trying to dictate to people in a foreign country what they should do and how they should think, endorsing a war of destruction in the name of nothing more, in the end, than his own personal comfort,\" Snyder wrote in a blog post.\n\nStanding By His Man, And His Money\n\nA 2017 investigation by now-imprisoned opposition leader Aleksei Navalny and his associates alleged that Medvedev used an array of charity and nonprofit organizations to collect $1.2 billion in donations from tycoons and state banks and then redirected the funds to purchase pricey assets, including luxury homes.\n\nMaria Snegovaya, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank, says the upsurge in Medvedev's belligerent public rhetoric is an attempt to demonstrate loyalty to Putin at a time of growing political infighting. \"Medvedev may want to signal to everyone that he is part of the system, that he is essentially by Putin's side,\" she told RFE/RL.\n\n\"I think he is desperate to at least secure some safety. His goal right now is to survive [within the system], not to climb his way back on the top of the vertical,\" she said, a reference to Medvedev's loss of influence since the end of presidency in 2012 and his loss of the prime minister's post in 2020.\n\nMedvedev once represented an influential faction in the constellation of competing groups that Putin uses to maintain power. But he has lost significant political weight over the years and some of his allies -- such as former Open Government Minister Mikhail Abyzov and the businessmen brothers Ziyavudin and Magomed Magomedov -- have ended up behind bars.\n\nMedvedev himself has fallen out of Putin's narrowing inner circle, now dominated by hawks with security-service backgrounds, in part due to the embarrassing allegations of corruption, analysts have said.\n\n'Fifth Column Of Traitors'\n\nAnd with the war in Ukraine clouding Russia's future, the atmosphere in the circles of power surrounding Putin may be tenser than ever.\n\nDenunciations and attacks on \"weak elements\" within the elite are on the rise \"and will become a big part of the dynamic,\" Snegovaya said, especially as the economy shrinks following the imposition of strict Western sanctions over the invasion.\n\nPutin has come out hard against any opposition to the war in Ukraine. In a chilling speech in mid-March, he asserted that there was a \"fifth column of national traitors\" inside the country and that Russians \"will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors.\"\n\nReports of senior Russian officials being put under house arrest have emerged in recent weeks following the initial failures in the war against Ukraine. Hard-line hawks within the elite may suspect Medvedev and his associates of not fully supporting the war, potentially making him an \"attractive\" target for attacks, Snegovaya said.\n\nArkady Dvorkovich, a former close adviser to Medvedev, was accused by a senior lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party of \"national betrayal\" last month after expressing concerns about the war and sympathy for civilians in Ukraine.\n\nDvorkovich soon stepped down as chairman of the Skolkovo Foundation, a technology hub located in Moscow region that emulates Silicon Valley and which Medvedev promoted on a trip to the United States during his presidency.\n\nRemember The 'Reset'?\n\nMedvedev, 56, has been one of Putin's most loyal allies over the past two decades. Putin tapped the former lawyer to succeed him as president in 2008 in order to avoid violating what was then a constitutional limit of two consecutive four-year terms.\n\nPutin's choice of Medvedev over fellow former KGB officer Sergei Ivanov \"signaled the possibility of a new, more liberal period in Russian politics, or so some hoped,\" Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow in 2012-14, wrote in his memoir, From Cold War To Hot Peace. Medvedev \"spoke a more sophisticated style of Russian than Putin, and seemed more orientated to, or at least familiar with, Western ideas,\" he wrote.\n\nMedvedev is not from the KGB and is a member of a generation of Russians who as a rule viewed the West and the collapse of the Soviet Union -- which came when he was in his 20s and Putin was almost 40 -- in a more positive light than their elders.\n\nIn a September 2009 article laying out his political vision, Medvedev described Russia's democracy as \"fragile\" and something that \"needs to be protected.\" He called for dialogue with civil society and touted changes he made to improve electoral competition. \"Putin had never said that,\" McFaul wrote.\n\nAs he was grooming his former campaign manager and fellow St. Petersburg native for the top job, Putin said that Medvedev could sometimes be tougher than him -- a remark that later seemed to presage Russia's invasion in Georgia in August 2008, three months after he took office.\n\nBut despite that move, Medvedev's presidency did seem to promise change, both at home and in ties with the West.\n\nHe pursued reforms at home and embraced President Barack Obama's \"reset\" of U.S.-Russia ties, signing the New START nuclear arms-reduction treaty with Obama in April 2010 and then smiling over cheeseburgers with him and enthusiastically taking in Silicon Valley during his U.S. visit that June.\n\nOn The Outside Looking In\n\nMedvedev's metamorphosis, if that is what it is, did not occur overnight. It slowly followed the sharp and steady souring of Russian-U.S. relations that can be traced to the end of 2011, when Putin accused the United States of fomenting protests over fraud-marred parliamentary elections and his decision -- announced by himself and Medvedev that September -- to return to the presidency in 2012.\n\nPutin swapped jobs with Medvedev, who remained in the No. 2 spot as prime minister until January 2020. Analysts said Putin replaced Medvedev as head of the government after he failed to deliver on the president's domestic priorities, including improving living standards.\n\nBut the shakeup also came as Putin was preparing constitutional amendments, adopted that July, that allow him to run for president again in 2024 and 2030, a move that seemed aimed to quash talk of a post-Putin Russia and ensure he could stay in power for years.\n\nPutin created a new role for Medvedev as deputy chairman of the Security Council, which is one of his main venues for decision-making on strategic issues but is a purely advisory body. Some analysts see the position as a sort of political retirement home for Medvedev. Putin is unlikely to \"put him in a position of trust anymore,\" Taylor said.\n\nMedvedev is among the top politicians least trusted by Russians, according to opinion polls, and Putin barred him from heading the United Russia party ticket for the September 2021 parliamentary elections.\n\nStarting around that time, Medvedev seems to have been seeking to step back into the spotlight with his acerbic, hawkish statements that are aligned with the rhetoric on state TV.\n\nThe new image as a brash Russian nationalist \"doesn't really fit him very well\" but may be part of a strategy to get back into a position of power at a later date, Taylor said.\n\n\"I think he -- maybe unrealistically -- still has political ambitions and doesn't know how the regime will shake out over the next few years, and he would rather be in power than out of power,\" he said. \"He may even still think that he could get the top job again.\"",

            "text": "Looking back at the past decade-and-a-half, we can see, with the benefit of hindsight, how the current aggression of Russia against Ukraine came to pass. It was enabled by the policies of the European neo-liberal elites.\n\nOn the day when Vladimir Putin decided to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he had no reason to fear any significant consequences from the West. For years, on many occasions and despite increasingly aggressive Russian behaviour he enjoyed gestures of support and friendship from the political leaders of countries such as Germany and France. It did not matter that he attacked Georgia, it did not matter when he annexed Crimea. It was still business as usual. So, why would he think that this time it would be any other way\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nGerhard Schr\u00f6der\n\nIn between the two long stretches of CDU rule (occasionally in coalition governments with the social democrats or the FDP liberals), there were several years during which Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (SPD \u2013 Social Democratic Party) was the chancellor. AndJust weeks before the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine he echoed Russia\u2019s rhetoric by saying on his podcast that Moscow had no interest in attacking Ukraine and felt alarmed by the accumulation of Nato troops in Eastern Europe.\u201cNato has not exactly been very restrained with exercises in the Baltic or Poland,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally, that has effects on Russia\u2019s thinking and threat assessment.\u201cI hope the sabre-rattling in Ukraine will be called off, because the things I\u2019m hearing from there, including finger-pointing at Germany because of its sensible refusal to export weapons \u2014 that really takes the biscuit.\u201dAlso in February 2022, he was nominated to join the board of directors at Gazprom.Talk about bad timing\u2026\n\nAngela Merkel\n\nAngela Merkel (CDU \u2013 Christian Democratic Union) has undoubtedly had a huge impact on the German and European political landscape, having served as the Chancellor of Germany for 16 years. The only person to serve longer than her was her fellow party member and mentor, Helmut Kohl, and he only served two weeks longer than her.Even though, a number of times, leaders of such countries as Poland and Ukraine warned her, that the project is intended to apply pressure on them by circumventing them as transit countries and denying them access to energy resources.And Merkel\u2019s cabinet would attempt to peddle a narrative according to which the pipelines would INCREASE the energy security of the region, since Germany would be able to resell Russian gas to them.But all this should not come as a surprise to anyone.At a 2007 meeting with Putin in Sochi, during her first term as Chancellor, she said \u201cthat Russia, when it was still the Soviet Union, was a very reliable supplier of energy resources for decades, and we would like this to continue.\u201dPerhaps Ms Merkel thought that by making Russia reliant on German money paid for natural gas, it is somehow possible to control Russia or at least prevent it from leading an imperialist policy. But this conviction soon fired back. Russia invaded Georgia the next year, and now, 15 years later,The Kremlin realises this very well, and possibly realised it back in 2007.To be fair to her, Angela Merkel did say in March 2014 that \u201cGermany will never accept the annexation of Crimea\u201d. But the lack of acceptance for the illegal annexation of the southern Ukrainian peninsula did not translate from words to deeds. Germany continued to make business deals with Russia. The decision to construct Nord Stream 2 was made just one year after the \u201cunacceptable\u201d annexation of Crimea.It seems that nothing Russia would do could serve as a wake-up call for Ms Merkel. Speaking in 2015, while she did concede that \u201cRussia has not made further progress in the past few years toward adopting many of the ideas that we share in the G7,\u201d she still hoped that Russia can be worked with to help provide for global security in what she termed \u201cNATO-Russia partnership\u201d.\u201cWe have the Normandy format for resolving the Ukraine crisis,\u201d she said. The Normandy format has clearly failed. She also said that \u201cRussia will and must also be included in efforts to resolve the Syrian civil war.\u201d Russia was backing the authoritarian regime of Bashar al-Assad in the conflict, yet Merkel stressed that \u201cit was only with the help of Russia that chemical weapons were removed from Syria,\u201d and so \u201cwe will also be discussing how Russia can be included.\u201d\n\nOlaf Scholz\n\nRestart, reset, engagement, dialogue, negotiations\u2026 They all come down to appeasement of a Putin dictatorship that has only become more hostile. Concessions to thugs and terrorists just encourage more aggression, as always. https://t.co/jFmtlZ0ozR \u2014 Garry Kasparov (@Kasparov63) January 3, 2022\n\nFor thirty years, Germans lectured Ukrainians about fascism. When fascism actually arrived, Germans funded it, and Ukrainians died fighting it. \u2014 Timothy Snyder (@TimothyDSnyder) April 20, 2022\n\nThe current Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz (SPD) has found himself in quite a conundrum. The Russian invasion of Ukraine began less than three months into his chancellorship. But he can hardly criticise Merkel\u2019s cabinet on its policy towards Russia.The current government is formed by a \u201cTraffic Lights Coalition\u201d (red for SPD, yellow for the liberal FDP, and green for\u2026 The Greens). And Olaf Scholz\u2019s Foreign Minister in the cabinet became the then co-leader of The Greens (in Germany, The Greens always make a point of electing two leaders, a woman and a man) Annalena Baerbock.Truly, keeping his own ministers in check must have been quite a toil for Mr Scholz, especially in a situation when interests of parties which may see eye-to-eye on some issues, but have radically different agenda\u2019s on others.In January, FM Baerbock also travelled to meet with her US counterpart, Antony Blinken, and the discussion about the threat posed by Russia was one of the topics of the talks., who Tweeted:Merely a week and a half before the war broke out, Chancellor Scholz still had hopes that the conflict could be avoided. \u201cThe diplomatic possibilities are far from being exhausted,\u201d Scholz said back then. He also praised the apparent withdrawal of the Russian troops from the border with Ukraine, following yet another unannounced \u201cmilitary manoeuvres.\u201dNow that the war has started, the Chancellor and his top diplomat are of one mind at least on one thing, and that is that Germany should not supply Ukraine with weapons, ostensibly because of Germany\u2019s troubled history with war.But when it comes to that, the outcome of such attitude has probably been best summarised by Timothy Snyder, an American historian specialising in the history of Central and Eastern Europe and especially the toll that totalitarian regimes took on the people of the region, who described the outcome of such policy in such blunt terms:Mr Snyder has written numerous books about the bloodied history of the countries wedged between Germany and Russia. He can most definitely write another historical opus about the events unfolding before our eyes, but for now, that Tweet offers a pretty decent summary of what German foreign policies in Central and Eastern Europe have brought about.A few weeks ago, the German government was ridiculed for offering to send Ukraine 5,000 helmets. The Germans stepped up their game a bit and offered to provide Ukraine with assistance in the form of other equipment. But when Ukrainians presented them with a list of the necessary material, the Germans struck out any requested heavy military equipment from it, such as e.g. Leopard tanks.\n\nWhat Chancellor Scholz offered instead, was that Germany will send to Ukraine its Soviet-era equipment, that the Federal Republic of Germany inherited from the People\u2019s Army of the communist German Democratic Republic (East Germany) upon German re-unification.\n\n\n\nThe excuses for that were several, one of them being that it would diminish Germany\u2019s own defensive capabilities. And that in spite of the fact that the German military industry is perfectly well capable of manufacturing enough equipment to provide for the defensive needs of Germany and more.\n\n\n\nMany countries of the former Eastern Bloc have offered to send Ukraine their Warsaw-Pact-era equipment. The difference here is that in the case of countries such as Czechia or Poland, this equipment has been conserved to be serviceable until very recently, while their militaries were updating their weaponry to the modern western-manufactured arsenal. Whether post-Soviet equipment that would be sent by Germany is at all serviceable after spending over 30 years rotting away in warehouses is dubious at best.\n\nDonald Tusk elected head of EPP The President of the European Council and former Polish PM Donald Tusk has been elected unopposed as leader of the European People\u2019s Party (EPP) at... see more\n\nDonald Tusk\n\nThe two existing strings of the Yamal gas pipeline. Photo: Wikimedia Commons/Samuel Bailey\n\nThe former Prime Minister of Poland and once-President of the European Council said in a recent interview given to the Polish weekly \u201cPolityka\u201d, that in Brussels, he had an opinion of a Russophobe, almost monomaniacally pre-occupied with Ukraine. But for those who have an attention span longer than the four-year electoral cycle, it is not exactly the way they may remember his behaviour or his policies towards Russia prior to the annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbas in 2014 (Mr Tusk was elected the President of the EC later that year).Mr Tusk became the Prime Minister of Poland after the snap election in 2007. But Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, who ran on the Law and Justice party ticket, remained the President of Poland. This led to a conflict between the offices of the PM, now Mr Tusk, and President Kaczy\u0144ski.Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, as well as his twin brother Jaros\u0142aw (who has served and continues to serve as the head of the Law and Justice party), have always remained wary of Russian imperial ambitions, seeking closer ties with the US as the largest NATO country and the best guarantor of Poland\u2019s security. There were even plans to construct elements of a US-backed anti-missile shield in Poland to increase its defensive capabilities.These plans were cancelled following the 2007 elections to avoid tensions with Russia.According to him, \u201cthe lack of dialogue serves neither Poland nor Russia. It is bad for the interests of both countries on the international arena,\u201d adding that \u201cthe time for a change in the matter [of Polish-Russian relations] is now,\u201d and that, according to him \u201csignals from our eastern neighbour confirm that they are also maturing to reach that conclusion.\u201dThroughout most of his tenure as PM, the Tusk cabinet attempted to distance itself from the US and tie Poland closer to Brussels, including by maintaining good relations with Berlin. Berlin and the Merkel government have, as previously demonstrated, done their best to maintain good relations with Russia at any cost, and the then Polish government attempted to do the same.When in 2008 Russian forces invaded the Caucasian country of Georgia, ostensibly to protect the people of the autonomous region of South Ossetia (which after Russian victory in the war was transformed into an internationally unrecognised breakaway republic under Russian protectorate \u2013 some of our observant readers may notice a pattern there\u2026), President Kaczy\u0144ski, along with the heads of state of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia visited the beleaguered Georgia and during a rally in the country\u2019s capital of Tbilisi addressed the crowds with words that now seem prophetic:The fact that the President was conducting his own foreign policy, independent of the Prime Minister, was not well received. PM Tusk and his cabinet have been trying to pursue a policy of rapprochement with the Kremlin, and President Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s visit did not help in achieving that goal., during what was to be a visit to the Katyn Memorial, where thousands of Polish officers murdered by the Soviet NKVD are buried. There were no survivors.The catastrophe immediately sparked accusations from Law and Justice politicians and supporters against the Kremlin, accusing Putin of orchestrating an assassination of the Polish President and his entourage. Several factors were of particular concern, e.g. aeroplane was of Soviet manufacture and as such, it was serviced in Russia. To exacerbate the matter the Polish government led by Donald Tusk relinquished the investigation to the Russian side, even though it could pursue an international investigation into the crash, which sparked accusations of at best gross negligence, and at worst collusion. The Russians refused to release the wreck of the aeroplane, leaving it to be exposed to the elements and eaten away by rust on the Smolensk airfield.But in Poland, the matter of who is responsible for the death of the President and the rest of the Polish delegation only fueled the polarisation of the political scene., and even mocked those who entertained the idea.Nine years after it was proposed, and six years after the construction beganMoreover, there were plans to sign a long-term contract for the supply of Russian natural gas via the Yamal pipeline until 2037, and securing Russian transit rights through Poland for supplying Europe with natural gas until 2045.\n\nSince the pipeline splits into two branches in Belarus, whose dictator, Alyaksandr Lukashenka is Putin\u2019s vassal, and one of the branches circumvents the territory of Poland, and the other the territory of Ukraine, each of the countries could at any time see its natural gas supply cut off entirely. The construction of Nord Stream and the abandonment of plans to diversify the Polish gas supply would put Poland and Ukraine entirely at Putin\u2019s mercy.\n\n\n\nIf Mr Tusk did indeed have an opinion of a Russophobe among other European politicians in Brussels, then it really tells us more about the state of mind of those politicians. If Poland\u2019s Deputy PM Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, who continues to maintain that Putin had his brother murdered, or Mr Donald Tusk, who completely dismissed the idea, are both Russophobes, then perhaps \u201cRussophobe\u201d is simply another word Brussels politicians use for \u201ca person from a country which had the misfortune to border Russia for centuries\u201d.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt\n\nGuy Verhofstadt is a liberal Flemish-Belgian politician, former Belgian MP, minister and Prime Minister, and currently an MEP and the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe faction in the European Parliament, in which position he has served since 2009.He is a strong advocate of a tighter European integration in the form of transforming the European Union into a federal entity, \u201cThe United States of Europe\u201d, which is also the title of a book he published in 2005.Back in 2002, following the shock of the 9/11 attacks, Mr Verhofstadt, who was then the Belgian PM, went even further. During a meeting of the Russia-NATO Council, which was meant to bring the alliance and Russia closer in terms of co-operating on global security, he said that:Any gains in those terms that Russia had made since the fall of communism have obviously been erased during the past 20 years of Putin\u2019s rule, and when it comes to global security, Russia has served as a destabilising factor. Not only when it invaded Georgia and now Ukraine, but also through its involvement in Mali and elsewhere.Mr Verhofstadt is one of those European politicians who have visited Ukraine in recent weeks and was abhorred by the evidence of atrocities perpetrated in places such as Borodyanka by the Russian invasion troops. To his credit, for the last several years he has been highly critical of European politicians who maintain a relationship with Russian politicians connected to the Kremlin. Justly so.The problem is that Mr Verhofstadt is linking anyone who disagrees with his liberal agenda, that is anyone who can be considered even remotely conservative, to Putin. For him, every conservative is just as bad as a dictator of a country that exercises practically full control of the media, imprisons or even murders political opponents, orders the invasion of neighbouring countries, and has his soldiers perpetrate genocide and other war crimes. Such a skewed perspective is not much different from accusing anyone with slightly different political views of being a re-incarnation of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, etc.And while it is true that several leaders of European conservative or right-wing movements have indeed fallen for the Kremlin peddled narrative portraying Putin\u2019s regime as one standing up to the \u201crotten, liberal West\u201d, even the current savage aggression perpetrated by Russia against Ukraine not quite making them rethink their attitude, some accusations are more hit-and-miss.\n\nFor example, Guy Verhofstadt has been an extremely vocal critic of the current Polish government. He was very critical of the \u201cWarsaw Summit\u201d, a conference of conservative and right- and centre-right-wing party leaders that occurred in Warsaw in December 2021, that was organised by the Polish ruling United Right coalition.\n\n\n\nIn a Tweet written in Polish, he referred to a very controversial comment made by Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French right-wing National Rally party. Her comment dated extremely poorly over the past several months, that is quite clear. But when Mr. Verhofstadt writes that \u201cOnly Putin and zero Europe\u2026 Law and Justice brings Poland closer to their national nightmare\u2026 in the name of blind party ambitions!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTylko Putin i zero Europy\u2026\n\n\n\nPiS przybli\u017ca Polsk\u0119 coraz bardziej do ich narodowego koszmaru\u2026 wszystko w imi\u0119 \u015blepych ambicji partyjnych ! https://t.co/h3JOAUKDnj \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) December 6, 2021\n\nWell\u2026 Ms Le Pen\u2019s comments, as already said, dated extremely poorly. The Hungarian PM, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, was also present at the summit, and his reluctance to give up cheap Russian crude oil and natural gas in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has met with harsh criticism from the Polish government, making the regional co-operation within the V4 group (made up of Poland, Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia) extremely hard.\n\n\n\nBut accusing the Polish conservatives of being Putin\u2019s supporters? People that believe that the Kremlin is responsible for the death of a Polish president from their own party?\n\n\n\nIt seems that according to Mr Verhofstadt\u2019s logic, the Polish government is some strange animal, in the vein of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat. It somehow manages to be anti-Russian and pro-Putin at the same time.\n\n\n\nAnd of course, any chance to lambast conservatives is a good one... So Guy Verhofstadt throws muck at conservative and right-wing politicians, and hopes something will stick. But he should be more careful when using photos of European politicians being chummy with Putin, because there are many European politicians that over the years have shaken Putin\u2019s hand. Including Mr Verhofstadt himself.\n\nWhen Europe is under threat, always remember:\n\n\n\nThose who talk about our sovereignty are always the first the sell it off ! pic.twitter.com/YqWxcPxqqH \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) February 22, 2022\n\nEmmanuel Macron\n\nCompared to other old hands listed so far, the President of the French Republic is relatively new to politics. His career only really began when he worked for one of the agencies of the Ministry of Finance in 2004 and served as an adviser to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande since 2006. But the only post he was ever elected to was that of the president, in 2017.Mr Macron\u2019s relationship with Putin is a complicated one. To his credit,He has also ordered airstrikes against Russian-backed Syrian government forces.His opinion on the subject may have evolved since then.he said in November 2019 in an interview given to The Independent. NATO Secretary-General and even Mr Macron\u2019s close ally, Chancellor Merkel, were shocked by the assessment, the latter even calling Macron\u2019s statement \u201cdrastic words\u201d. This was in contrast to the reaction of the Kremlin. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson called them \u201ctruthful words\u201d.And perhaps most controversially, he defended the selling of French-manufactured weapons to Russia, which occurred between 2014 and 2020, so after the illegal annexation of Crimea. While it is true that the decision was originally made by the Hollande administration, President Macron did not immediately put a stop to the arms trade.It seems that the ability to freely trade with Russia is very important to the French leader.The fact that many countries are not comfortable with Russia due to its aggressive policies appears to have eluded him. The fact that France, positioned on the other side of Europe and far away from Russia, may have been a contributing factor.Back in the day he said that the sanctions were inefficient, and that they \u201chave changed absolutely nothing in Russia \u2014 I am not proposing at all to lift them, I am just stating this.\u201d Well, that much has definitely proven true. The question is whether the correct course of action would not have been applying more sanctions, something that European countries were in the end forced to do, but it is happening only now, after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Macron has made numerous phone calls to Putin following the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian hostilities to a full-scale invasion. His frequent contacts with Putin and attempts at diplomacy have even invited mockery. Macron\u2019s attempts to broker peace have also been criticised by some politicians, including the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki who, when commenting on the French President for his efforts, asked whether he would also negotiate with Hitler. This prompted the French head of state to lash out against the Polish PM, not only accusing him of trying to interfere in French elections on behalf of Marine Le Pen, but also of being an antisemite and homophobe.\n\n\n\nAccording to President Macron, following the revelation of war crimes perpetrated on Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and its vicinity, he is no longer in direct contact with Vladimir Putin. He has also joined the calls for an embargo on Russian crude oil, although, notably, not on natural gas. But just as the call for an embargo on one strategic energy resource the sale of which is filling the Kremlin\u2019s coffers is blunted by the refusal to give up another one, he has been rather coy when it comes to calling a spade a spade.\n\n\u201cSo far, it has been established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and bring them to justice,\u201d Macron said during an interview given to France 2 television channel on April 13. As he said \u201cI am very careful with some terms [genocide] these days,\u201d he added. \u201cI'm not sure the escalation of words is helping the cause right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nFortunately for Mr Macron, who is running for re-election (the second round of the French presidential election will take place on April 24), his reluctance to call the genocide Russians are perpetrating against Ukrainians a genocide is still probably not as jarring as Ms Le Pen\u2019s statements about Crimea belonging within the Russian sphere of influence.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy\n\nsource: TVP World\n\nAnd finally, on a brief note, the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Sarkozy was one of the western leaders who helped negotiate a cease-fire during the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008 (officially: \u201cpeace enforcement\u201d). The Kremlin agreed to halt its invasion of its southern neighbour, once they have achieved their military goals, that is the conquest of South Ossetia. So perhaps giving Sarkozy too much credit for his role in the cessation of hostilities would be a bit of a stretch.But the issue is not Mr Sarkozy\u2019s role in brokering a cease-fire, but rather what followed.In a speech on April 3, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited Mr Sarkozy (as well as Angela Merkel) to visit Bucha, the site of the Russian-perpetrated massacre. He said that while he does not blame anyone except Russia for the aggression on Ukraine, he insisted the two former leaders \u201csee tortured Ukrainians with their own eyes\u201d, so that they can understand what the concession policy to Russia has led to 14 years later.",

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The Russians hadn\u2019t taken into account the railway saboteurs of Belarus. Starting in the earliest days of the invasion in February, a clandestine network of railway workers, hackers and dissident security forces went into action to disable or disrupt the railway links connecting Russia to Ukraine through Belarus, wreaking havoc on Russian supply lines.\n\nThe attacks have drawn little attention outside Belarus amid the drama of the Russian onslaught and the bloody aftermath of Russia\u2019s humiliating retreat. Fierce Ukrainian resistance and tactical errors by an ill-prepared Russian force were likely enough to thwart Russia\u2019s plans, analysts say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Belarus railway saboteurs can at least claim a role in fueling the logistical chaos that quickly engulfed the Russians, leaving troops stranded on the front lines without food, fuel and ammunition within days of the invasion.\n\nAlexander Kamyshin, head of Ukrainian railways, expressed Ukraine\u2019s gratitude to the Belarusian saboteurs. \u201cThey are brave and honest people who have helped us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe attacks were simple but effective, targeting the signal control cabinets essential to the functioning of the railways, members of the activist network said. For days on end, the movement of trains was paralyzed, forcing the Russians to attempt to resupply their troops by road and contributing to the snarl-up that stalled the infamous 40-mile military convoy north of Kyiv.\n\nHow much of the chaos can be attributed to the sabotage and how much to poor logistical planning by the Russians is hard to tell, especially as there is no independent media reporting from Belarus, said Emily Ferris, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. But without automated signaling, trains were forced to slow to a crawl and the number of them traveling on the tracks at any one time would have been severely restricted, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGiven the Russian reliance on trains, I\u2019m sure it contributed to some of the problems they had in the north. It would have slowed down their ability to move,\u201d she said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t push further into Ukrainian territory and snarled their supply lines because they had to rely on trucks.\u201d\n\nThe attacks also bought time for Ukrainian troops to formulate an effective response to the Russian invasion, said Yury Ravavoi, a Belarusian activist and trade unionist who escaped to Poland under threat of arrest during the anti-government protests that rocked Belarus in 2020.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say we were the most important factor, but we were an important brick in the wall,\u201d he said.\n\nThe saboteurs drew inspiration from an earlier episode in Belarusian history, during World War II, when Belarusians opposed to the Nazi occupation blew up railway lines and train stations to disrupt German supply lines. The Rail War, as it is known, is venerated as a moment of triumph for Belarus, taught in schools as the most successful of the tactics deployed by resistance fighters that eased the way for Soviet troops to drive the Germans out.\n\nThe battle for control over eastern and southern Ukrainian cities is the latest stage in this war, as Russia attempts to solidify its grip on the Black Sea. (Video: Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)\n\nEight decades later, it is Russia\u2019s presence in Belarus that has stirred dissent. The deployment of tens of thousands of Russian troops in Belarus in preparation for the invasion of Ukraine triggered widespread domestic opposition and rekindled opposition networks formed during the 2020 protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said Hanna Liubakova, a Belarusian journalist living in exile in Lithuania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis second Rail War has taken a more benign form than its predecessor. The partisans were keen not to inflict casualties, Ravavoi said. So they focused their attacks on damaging equipment to stop the railways from functioning.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to kill any Russian army or Belarusian train drivers. We used a peaceful way to stop them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe and other Belarusians involved in organizing the attacks decline to reveal precise details of how the attacks were carried out and by whom, citing the need for secrecy and concerns for the safety of the railway partisans, as the saboteurs are loosely known.\n\nThree main groups have been involved, representing railway workers, security force defectors and cyber specialists, said Lt. Col Alexander Azarov, a former security official living in Warsaw who heads the security force group called Bypol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRailway employees sympathetic to the partisans have leaked details of Russian movements and the locations of key railway infrastructure to a group called the Community of Railway Workers, which shares them on Telegram channels. Supporters on the ground link up to carry out the attacks, but there is no formal chain of command, Azarov said.\n\n\u201cOur movement is not centralized,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a leader of the resistance. It\u2019s horizontal, with dozens of groups working on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe third group, the Cyber Partisans, is formed of exiled Belarusian IT professionals who have carried out several cyberattacks on the Belarusian government since joining in 2020.\n\nThe Cyber Partisans launched the first attack, hacking into the railway\u2019s computer network in the days leading up to the invasion and snarling rail traffic before Russian troops had even crossed the border. Infiltrating the railway network\u2019s computers was relatively easy, said Yuliana Shemetovets, a spokesperson for the group who is based in New York, because the railway company is still using Windows XP, an outdated version of the software that contains many vulnerabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting on Feb. 26, two days after the invasion began, a succession of five sabotage attacks against signaling cabinets brought train traffic to an almost complete halt, said Sergey Voitekhovich, a former railway employee now based in Poland who is a leader in the Community of Railway Workers.\n\nBy Feb. 28, satellite photographs began to appear of the 40-mile convoy of Russian trucks and tanks ostensibly headed from Belarus toward Kyiv. Within a week, the convoy had completely stalled as vehicles ran out of fuel or broke down.\n\nThe Belarusian authorities have since launched an intense effort to prevent attacks and hunt down the saboteurs. The Interior Ministry has decreed that damaging railway infrastructure is an act of terrorism, a crime that carries a 20-year prison term.\n\nDozens of railway workers have been randomly detained and their phones searched for evidence that they were in touch with the partisans, the activists say. At least 11 Belarusians are in custody, accused of participating in the attacks, according to human rights groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early April, security police captured three alleged saboteurs near the town of Bobruisk and shot them in the knees. State television broadcast footage of the bleeding men, their knees bandaged, and claimed they had been shot while resisting arrest.\n\nThe shootings have had a chilling effect on the saboteur network, Azarov said. Belarusian troops are patrolling and drones have been deployed to monitor the railway lines. \u201cIt has become too dangerous to do attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nBut by the time of the police shooting, Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the area around Kyiv was in full swing and the Kremlin had announced it would refocus its military effort on capturing the east of Ukraine. The majority of the Russian troops that entered Ukraine from Belarus are now in the process of being redeployed to the east, the Pentagon says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe believe the fact that the Russians gave up on taking Kyiv is a result of our work because the Russians didn\u2019t feel as safe in Belarus as they had expected,\u201d said Franak Viacorka, spokesman for Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. \u201cThousands of Russian troops didn\u2019t receive food, they didn\u2019t receive fuel, and they didn\u2019t receive equipment on time.\u201d\n\nNow, a new phase in the rail war may be underway. In recent days the railway activists have posted on Telegram photographs of damage to signaling cabinets along Russian railway lines being used to transport troops into eastern Ukraine. The attacks can\u2019t be independently confirmed, but Voitekhovich claimed members of his railway network are involved. \u201cThere are open borders between Belarus and Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "4/24/2022\n\ntags: foreign policy\n\nDaniel Herman is Professor of American History at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington. He is the author of three monographs including Hell on the Range: A Story of Honor, Conscience, and the American West (2010) and the novel The Feudist (2020).\n\nUS Senator John McCain speaks to a pro-EU crowd in Kyiv, December 2013.\n\nThis past March, three esteemed colleagues at Central Washington University convened a teach-in to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine (they convened another one in April, which I didn\u2019t attend and so won\u2019t talk about). The presenters\u2014all experts in the fields of Russian history and culture\u2014gave bravura expositions exploring Russian nationalism, empire building, war, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. To my mind, however, something was missing: dissent.\n\nThough effective in its aims\u2014to teach history and generate support (including money) for Ukraine\u2014this particular teach-in differed profoundly from civil disobedience campaigns of the Vietnam era. Those who participated in the original anti-war teach-ins of the 1960s stood the risk of being ridiculed, bombed, spied on by FBI agents, and excoriated by community authorities and administrators. The CWU presenters, by contrast, buttressed rather than challenged a dominant narrative, given that 70% of Americans already view Russia as a threat. If the presenters are critical of hawkish U.S. foreign policy and the decades-long expansion of the military-industrial complex, not to mention the role of the U.S. in heightening tensions in Ukraine, they didn\u2019t say so.\n\nI find this particularly troubling at a time when 45% of Americans\u2014and 81% of Republicans\u2014view President Biden\u2019s actions viz. Ukraine as too cautious; 46% support a U.S.-imposed no-fly zone even when told it would risk nuclear war; and Congressional Democrats (Democrats!) seek to add billions more to the already record military budget that the administration requests.\n\nI\u2019m no expert on the history of Russia or Ukraine, but I am an avid consumer of news and I know quite a bit about U.S. history, including the history of U.S. wars and public opinion. In the spirit of scholarly debate\u2014and with respect and admiration for the presenters\u2014I take it upon myself to offer a dissenting view.\n\nHad I been among the presenters, I would have asserted that the overwhelming American support for Ukrainians in their fight against Russia\u2014though not without justice\u2014resembles earlier moments of American solidarity with European nations fighting authoritarianism, particularly 1917, when the U.S., reacting to German attacks and atrocities (but ignorant of British atrocities) joined the Entente Powers in what President Wilson called \u201ca war for democracy.\u201d Though the U.S. helped defeat autocratic Germany, the war spawned persecutions, authoritarianism, and jingoism at home (not least among Democrats, particularly intellectuals) and\u2014due to the terms of the Versailles Treaty\u2014fueled the rise of Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn that 1917 moment, like this one, a bellicose press\u2014with assistance from a bellicose government\u2014shut down dissent and marginalized dissenters. Randolph Bourne\u2019s justly famous essay condemning war fever seems every bit as apropos as it was in 1917.\n\nI do not doubt that Putin (rather like Germany\u2019s Kaiser) is a would-be imperialist who holds nostalgia for the Soviet Union and/or \u201cGreater Russia,\u201d and would like to recreate one or both, albeit without communism. The probability of that happening, however, seems exceedingly low. Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin had said that those who wish to recreate the Soviet Union \u201chave no brain\u201d and that his conventional military can in no way match that of NATO. More to the point, recreating the Soviet Union or Greater Russia would be enormously expensive and almost certainly impossible, no matter the outcome in Ukraine (part of why the Soviet Union dissolved was because the empire was more encumbrance than asset).\n\nMy own take is that the Western media\u2019s anti-Putin, pro-Ukraine, pro-NATO barrage has blinded both Americans and Europeans (especially the British, those hoary players of the \u201cGreat Game\u201d) to the fact that Putin, though capable of great brutality, is a rational actor. He is as likely to consolidate power due to the West\u2019s fervent response as to lose it. By making a diplomatic solution almost impossible (politicians need public support for any offer to lift sanctions as part of a peace package), the West\u2019s fervency might well protract the killing for years and destabilize Eastern Europe.\n\nLet me start my more detailed discussion by talking about NATO expansion. One of the teach-in presenters acknowledged that the U.S. and its European allies may have made a mistake by expanding NATO into nations that comprised the old Soviet Union but added that \u201cwoulda/couldas\u201d of past policymaking are beside the point. I disagree passionately. Revisiting \u201cwoulda/couldas\u201d is probably the only thing that can bring peace, at least any time in the near future.\n\nI have no particular expertise in foreign policy, but I defer to those who do (or did before their decease): George Kennan, the doyen of American Cold War policy; Paul Nitze, Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan; Paul Warnke, director of the Arms Control Association and SALT II negotiator; Richard Pipes, noted historian of the Soviet Union; Gary Hart, former Colorado Senator and co\u2011chair of the U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century; Jack Matlock, President Reagan\u2019s ambassador to the Soviet Union; Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State under Richard Nixon; William Perry, Secretary of Defense to Bill Clinton; and Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense under George Bush and Barack Obama. All of them\u2014and many others\u2014feared that NATO expansion into the former Soviet Union would lead to a renewed Cold War, if not a hot one.\n\nKennan\u2019s words are particularly apropos. The NATO expanders, he argued, had \u201clittle understanding of Russian history and Soviet history. Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then [the NATO expanders] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cI think it is the beginning of a new cold war \u2026 I think it is a tragic mistake.\u201d\n\nIn their zeal to punch Vladimir Putin, modern Democrats and their preferred media voices are quick to dismiss or diminish the assertion that the U.S. played a significant role in provoking the war (this isn\u2019t the Democratic Party of the 1970s or even the early 2000s; it\u2019s a party dedicated, or at least inured, to regime change policies, not just for Russia, but also Syria, Libya, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, Bolivia, and others to be announced). But yes, alas, the U.S. and NATO did much to provoke the war, and not just by expanding NATO. The U.S. also provoked the war with its own election meddling in Eastern Europe, especially in Ukraine, a meddling that was magnitudes\u2014light years\u2014greater than whatever Russia did or did not do in our 2016 election.\n\nSomething I have not seen reported in any mainstream venue is that as late as 2008, fully 50% of Ukrainians opposed NATO membership versus 24.3% who supported it. Another 2008 poll showed even greater opposition (56% against joining NATO versus 15% for). In a 2010 Gallup poll, 40% of Ukrainians viewed NATO as more threat than protector (just 17% said the opposite). What those poll numbers suggest is that the current situation resulted not from timeless Ukrainian fears of Russian aggression, but from blundering, arrogant neo-conservative Western foreign policy, along with equally blundering and over-aggressive Russian and Ukrainian policies since 2008.\n\nPolicy blunders, to be sure, weren\u2019t the only mover of opinion. Both the U.S. and EU offered powerful economic incentives. Quite simply, the EU and US are vastly wealthier than Russia and can offer enormous loans, bailouts, and investment capital. The fact that Russia has been Ukraine\u2019s main export partner, however, equalizes the equation to a degree.\n\nIf free market economics alone are driving Ukraine\u2019s movement toward the West, Russia should stand out of the way. The West, however, has not let the invisible hand do all the work. It also deploys another, more visible\u2014more problematic\u2014hand: the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), an agency created under President Reagan to perform tasks once under the purview of the CIA, including \u201cfostering \u2026 political parties, trade unions, free markets and business organizations.\u201d As idealistic and non-controversial as those goals sound, NED has a long history of promoting regime change; one observer calls it the National Endowment (for Meddling) in Democracy. In Ukraine, NED has poured tens of millions of dollars into building a pro-Western constituency. NED\u2019s European cousin, the European Endowment for the Democracy, has done the same on a smaller scale. They are assisted by the West\u2019s lavishly funded NGO complex, which (like NED) extended its reach across Eastern Europe. Total U.S. investment in Ukrainian \u201cgood governance\u201d and \u201cother goals,\u201d averred former Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland (now Undersecretary of State), amounted to $5 billion between 1991 and 2013.\n\nLet\u2019s step back a moment and imagine that Russia was an economic juggernaut able to spend $5 billion to turn Mexico into a close ally, modernize its army. Imagine, moreover, that Russia proposed to station troops\u2014along with anti-ballistic missiles\u2014in Mexico after bringing it into a defensive alliance (which is what NATO has done in nations formerly allied with Russia). Imagine, moreover, that Mexico was receptive to Russia\u2019s money\u2014and welcomed its meddling\u2014because it was poor and because some of its citizens, but not a majority, had lingering fears of U.S. hostility. Keep in mind that the U.S. has invaded Mexico twice, though not recently. That is precisely what the United States and its NATO allies have done in Ukraine.\n\nOne can certainly reply that Western meddling is necessary to counter Russian meddling. Russia clearly supports Ukrainian parties and leaders that favor its interests. No doubt it has brought tremendous pressure to bear on Ukrainian governments. I reiterate, however, that, as late as 2010, Ukrainians didn\u2019t want to join NATO. It was the West that had to lobby Ukrainians to gain support.\n\nThe NED/NGO complex is obviously not the only reason that Ukrainians have increasingly favored entering NATO and the EU. There is also the matter of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for the breakaway states in the Donbas (including sending a small number of troops), which occurred in reaction to Ukraine\u2019s Maidan revolution in 2014. The effect of Russia\u2019s decision was to strengthen Ukrainian nationalism and support for NATO, partly due to Russia\u2019s straightforward aggression, and partly because the withdrawal of Crimea and the Donbas greatly diminished Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian electorate.[1]\n\nGiven that Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea and Donbas created a predictable Ukrainian backlash, why did Russia take them? What we mostly hear from the cable press\u2014whether Fox, MSNBC, or CNN\u2014is that Putin\u2019s Russia is an imperialist, hateful, lying nation guided by the idea that might makes right. The Maidan revolution and its aftermath, however, is complex and ambiguous.\n\nTo understand that revolution\u2014or coup, by some accounts\u2014we have to go back to 2008, when George W. Bush, along with NATO, declared that Ukraine and Georgia would both become NATO members. Russia\u2014which had been warning against NATO expansion even before the first wave in 1999\u2014threatened war if that happened. From the Russian point of view, NATO wasn\u2019t an innocent, defensive alliance, but an aggressive, pro-Western alliance seeking to encircle them, isolate them economically, and, ultimately, strangle them militarily. In his speech justifying the Ukraine invasion, Putin discussed the threat of NATO encirclement in his first substantive paragraph and mentioned NATO nine more times. It is certainly possible that Putin invoked the NATO threat in an effort to disguise ulterior motives (e.g., recreating the Soviet Union), but to make that assumption is to overlook longstanding Russian fears.\n\nThe fact that NATO placed a \u201cdefensive\u201d shield of anti-ballistic missiles in former Warsaw Pact nations\u2014ostensibly to shoot down nuclear weapons launched by Iran\u2014was particularly anathema to Russia. From the Russian point of view, the West sought to give itself impunity to launch a nuclear attack without Russia being able to retaliate (since its missiles would be shot down). This would give the West so-called \u201cfirst-strike capability.\u201d The fact that the U.S. proceeded to withdraw from one arms-control treaty after another\u2014ABM, the INF, the Open Skies Treaty\u2014only intensified Russian fears (to be fair, the U.S. and NATO have accused Russians of any number of treaty violations; this is not simply a \u201cWest is malicious\u201d scenario, nor is it simply a \u201cRussia is malicious\u201d scenario).\n\nThe latter two treaty withdrawals, incidentally, were decisions by Putin\u2019s ostensible best friend, Donald Trump, who was also the first president to send \u201clethal aid\u201d (mostly meaning Javelin anti-tank missiles) to Ukraine, thus overturning Obama\u2019s decision not to do so for fear of worsening tensions and arming neo-Nazi \u201cthugs.\u201d Trump, too\u2014contrary to popular perceptions\u2014ramped up economic sanctions beyond Congressional mandates, causing Putin to believe that the West was waging economic war. Whether those sanctions were justified is a question I\u2019ll put aside for now; what is likely, however, is that they did more harm than good.\n\nWe can argue about whether Russian leaders are/were irrational to think that the West is out to get them, but it\u2019s unquestionably true that\u2019s what many of them thought and continue to think. Those fears led Russia to develop hypersonic nuclear-tipped missiles that the West thus far cannot defend against. They also led Russia to attack Georgia in 2008 in a five-day war initiated by Georgia\u2019s illegal attempt to reclaim a breakaway region called South Ossetia. This is a war that Russia\u2019s detractors cite as evidence that Putin is ruthless and seeks to recreate the Soviet Union. The actuality was a great deal more complex, and did not end with Russia annexing Georgia (though it continues to pose a military threat to Georgia).\n\nNor will Russia annex Ukraine, despite what we hear in the media. Its troops aren\u2019t positioned to capture the whole of Ukraine, much less occupy it. The objective seems to be to destroy Ukraine\u2019s military capabilities and to carve off a part of eastern Ukraine in order to attach Crimea to Russia by land and to better defend the Donbas. One would never know this from watching CNN, but, according to U.S. military and intelligence officials, Russian forces\u2014despite inflicting enormous carnage\u2014have been deliberately restrained in order to give room for diplomacy. The other objective seems to be precisely what Putin has stated: to ensure that Ukraine does not become a member of NATO. Nor am I willing to entirely discredit Putin\u2019s statement that he seeks to \u201cde-Nazify\u201d Ukraine (more on that later), given the Azov Battalion\u2019s role in attacks on the Donbas.\n\nStill, as my colleagues insist, this is Putin\u2019s war. He made an illegal decision to invade a sovereign nation. He and his supporters deserve whatever they get. Yes, but no, that\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nEven in the early 2000s, the NED/NGO complex had gone to work to turn Ukraine into a pro-Western nation. After NATO\u2019s decision in 2008 to encourage Ukraine\u2019s admission (I say \u201cencourage admission\u201d because, to reiterate, Ukrainians themselves opposed it), the fight for Ukrainian hearts and minds became more fraught, with pro-Western forces competing against Russophones to elect a favorable government. This was an inherently destabilizing situation.\n\nA turning point came in 2010, when Ukraine elected Viktor Yanukovych as president. Though considered pro-Russian, he strongly favored integrating Ukraine\u2019s economy with the European Union, partly by negotiating an EU economic bailout package. In 2013, however, he turned down the EU\u2019s offer because it required austerity measures that would shred Ukraine\u2019s social safety net and, arguably, because it contained strict anti-corruption requirements (Ukraine is awash in corruption). When Russia offered its own bailout deal sans austerity and anti-corruption measures and with guaranteed access to cheap natural gas, Yanukovych accepted, triggering his right-wing opponents to accuse him of making secret concessions (presumably involving control of Ukraine\u2019s gas pipelines).\n\nWhat often got lost in coverage of the ensuing protests was that Yanukovych\u2019s Russia deal protected industrial jobs in Ukraine\u2019s eastern \u201cRust Belt\u201d that might well disappear under the EU package. Nor did Western coverage give much attention to Russia\u2019s fears that cheap EU imports would undermine its fragile economy. Not surprisingly, the strongly pro-free enterprise NED/NGO complex went to work to undermine Yanukovych by working closely with the leaders of the Maidan revolution.\n\nThe U.S. and its NED/NGO apparatus did not create the Maidan phenomenon, to be sure, but did steer it to their own ends. Multiple U.S. officials\u2014including Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and Republican John McCain\u2014met with members of the far-right Svoboda party to affirm their support for Maidan. The equivalent would be Russian leaders meeting directly with, say, January 6 insurrectionaries. The staunchly neoconservative Assistant Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, moreover, called Geoffrey Pyatt, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine to instruct him about which Ukrainians the U.S. wanted in President Yanukovych\u2019s ministry and which ones the U.S. wanted excluded. Nuland in particular recommended Arseniy Yatsenyuk (\u201cYats is the guy who\u2019s got the economic experience,\u201d she says in the leaked audio of the call). After Maidan forces forced Yanukovych to flee the country (even after he had called new elections), Yatsenyuk became president. In a space of five months, Yatsenyuk nixed the Russia bailout deal, resuscitated the EU package (including austerity), and resigned.\n\nDid Maidan amount to a U.S.-endorsed coup? Was Nuland promoting Yatsenyuk for the role of president? We\u2019re told that the idea that the U.S. supported a coup in Ukraine is Russian disinformation, but are we sure? What precisely did Geoffrey Pyatt mean by \u201c[we need] somebody with an international personality to come out here and help to midwife this thing.\u201d Did Pyatt require a high-profile Western leader to visit Ukraine merely to endorse a ministerial shuffle? Or was the U.S. playing a bigger game? At the very least, the U.S. was meddling in Ukraine\u2019s politics to impose its will.\n\nIn supporting the Maidan project, the U.S. found a ready ally not just in the professorial accountant, Yatsenyuk, but also in Ukraine\u2019s energetic far-right, which provided shock troops\u2014militants\u2014in the protests in Kyiv and elsewhere. After those protests succeeded, the new government repealed a law allowing Russian as an official language in Eastern Ukraine, outlawed left-wing political parties (due to their sympathy with Russia) and outright banned and/or greatly curtailed books imported from Russia. Right-wing thugs meanwhile attacked left-wing political gatherings and drove them underground while the Ukrainian government looked the other way. NED\u2019s president, Carl Gershwin (prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to neo-con Jeanne Kirkpatrick of the Reagan administration) openly boasted that Maidan was a first step toward ousting Putin. This sort of statement fell short of optimal diplomacy, but was, and is, ubiquitous among Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment (aka, \u201cthe Blob\u201d).\n\nShortly after Maidan\u2014and the violence and repression that followed\u2014the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine passed referendums demanding (depending on how one translates) either to be fully independent or at least autonomous (the latter would be akin to creating Ukrainian federalism akin to that of the United States). There is little question that the referendums were replete with irregularities and coercion and lacked legitimacy under Ukrainian law. It\u2019s equally clear that much of the Donbas population\u2014with equal justification\u2014believed the Maidan government to be illegal (Yanukovych, after all, had prevailed in a fair election) and were infuriated by the Maidan government\u2019s attacks on separatists.\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, poured $2.5 billion into Ukraine\u2019s military seeking to modernize it, partly so it could recapture the breakaway states. The CIA began training Ukrainians to fight in the Donbas in 2015. Though it performed poorly in the early days, the Ukrainian army, along with right-wing paramilitary forces (there were 102,000 of them as of 2020), soon began inflicting agonies. In the war that followed, some 14,000 died between 2014 and 2022. According to the U.N., 81% of civilian casualties were in rebel-held areas between 2018 and 2021, a time when cease-fire agreements supposedly existed in accordance with Minsk protocols. To be sure, civilian casualties had diminished steeply from 2014-15, but cease-fire violations were numerous, and it was Ukrainian attackers who were mostly in violation.\n\nAn aside here on Ukrainian neo-Nazis who played roles in both the Maidan revolution and the fighting in the Donbas: There\u2019s a concerted effort afoot to paint them as selfless patriots who either never were genuine Nazis, or who have given up their ideology, or who represent but a tiny sliver of Ukraine\u2019s population. Examine reporting on those same right-wing zealots from before the Russian invasion and you\u2019ll find a different picture.\n\nIn 2020, Tim Lister of the U.S. Military Academy\u2019s Combating Terrorism Center had this to say: \u201cIn recent years, some Americans and Europeans drawn to various brands of far-right nationalism have looked to Ukraine as their field of dreams: a country with a well-established, trained, and equipped far-right militia\u2014the Azov Regiment\u2014that has been actively engaged in the conflict against Russian-backed separatists in Donbas. Most of these \u2018foreign fighters\u2019 appear to travel as individuals and at their own expense, according to the author\u2019s review of many cases, but there is a broader relationship between the Ukrainian far-right, and especially its political flagship the National Corps, and a variety of far-right groups and individuals in the United States and Europe.\u201d\n\nThough the U.S. theoretically bars arms shipments to Ukraine\u2019s right-wing militias, there is no way to know precisely where the massive influx of arms will go (just as there was no way to stop U.S. arms shipments from flowing to Al Nusra in Syria or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan). You can find more now pass\u00e9 and impolitic warnings about Ukraine\u2019s Nazis here, here, here, here, and here. Also, here, here, here, and here. And here, too. And here, here, here, and here. And here and here and here. The U.S. policy of flooding Ukraine with arms, in short, might well strengthen (and embolden) far-right constituencies throughout Eastern Europe, and possibly Western Europe.\n\nTo end the fighting, Ukraine, Russia, the Donbas states, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) hammered out the Minsk I and Minsk II accords in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Both created a path for the breakaway regions to gain autonomous status. The Ukrainian right, however\u2014which continued to pour fighters into the Donbas\u2014refused to honor the terms and the Ukrainian government did little to restrain them. Though President Zelensky demanded that right-wing militias leave the Donbas as a preliminary to making peace with Russia, he was met with adamant refusal as well as threats on his life. Since then, he has decided to work with the far-right. Ethnic Russians in the Donbas also violated the accords. Both sides, according to the U.N., abducted and tortured opponents, though the most gratuitous crime was committed by pro-Maidan forces that in 2014 set fire to a trade union building in Odessa, killing over 40 anti-Maidan protestors.\n\nSo, why did Putin and Russia wait to attack Ukraine until 2022, fully eight years after Russia annexed Crimea and the Donbas declared independence? Putin claims\u2014not without evidence\u2014that Ukraine was planning an offensive to reclaim Crimea and the Donbas. How did he know? Partly because President Zelensky had announced his intention to do so in 2021. Then\u2014in summer 2022, presumably\u2014Ukraine would join NATO as a full member. Zelensky announced that, too, in a tweet he later deleted (Zelensky, incidentally, asked the U.S. to say once and for all whether Ukraine would be allowed into NATO. He was told that no, probably not, but for appearances sake the answer was yes. Some observers suggest that the U.S., by leaving the door open, was deliberately luring Putin into war.) Once Ukraine joined NATO, Russia would have faced an Article 5 war against NATO to defend either the Donbas or its annexed territory in Crimea. Article 5 is the article in NATO\u2019s charter stipulating that a war against one member is a war against all, and that all will defend the one. Russia had zero prospect of winning such a war short of using nuclear weapons.\n\nThat alone, however, did not precipitate immediate attack. Putin massed forces on Ukraine\u2019s border in the hope of forcing Ukraine and the West to agree to Ukraine\u2019s neutrality (that is, a guarantee that Ukraine would not join NATO). He was also reacting to Ukraine\u2019s violation of the Minsk accords, including an increase in shelling and the use of weaponized drones. President Zelensky\u2019s stated willingness to pursue nuclear weapons undoubtedly figured in Putin\u2019s thinking, too.\n\nAccording to CIA sources, Putin\u2019s decision to attack Ukraine was made at the last minute, after his diplomatic overtures (which included direct talks with European leaders) failed. In other words, contrary to endless assertions in our media, the attack on Ukraine was not a long-planned decision meant to recreate the Soviet Union.\n\nIf Putin was correct\u2014if Ukraine intended to recapture Crimea and the Donbas, then promptly sign on with NATO\u2014his decision to invade was a preemptive strategy. That is not to say he lacked peaceful options. He could have recognized the Donbas states and stationed troops in them without embarking on a wholesale invasion. Alternately, he could have continued to seek support for the Minsk protocols, especially given that the Donbas holds limited economic and strategic importance to Russia and is an enormous drain on the Russian treasury. It is harder, however, to imagine Putin surrendering Russia\u2019s strategically important Black Sea naval base at Sevastopol (Crimea), which Ukraine would hand over to NATO. An apt analogy would be Cuba handing over the American base at Guantanamo to Russia. The U.S. would never allow it.\n\nWhatever his options, he declared a war. No doubt you have noticed, given that the U.S. media spent more time covering the Ukraine war in the last month than it spent in any previous month on any war in the past 31 years, including Iraq. Either a certain news-obsessed demographic of Americans is utterly fixated on the war, or the media really really wants Americans to care about it. Or both.\n\nThat observation becomes more interesting when one considers that, according to a Rasmussen poll, support for direct U.S. involvement correlates with income. The wealthier you are, the more likely you are to support U.S. involvement (at least in the hypothetical situation that the war escalates beyond Ukraine). Wealth tracks with whiteness and educational attainment, which, in turn, tracks with the mainstream media\u2019s main clientele: prosperous white Americans who grew up during the Cold War. Mind you, the mainstream media\u2019s coverage isn\u2019t falsified; it\u2019s simply credulous. It routinely reports faulty and/or speculative intelligence that the U.S. puts out for PR and strategic purposes, not to mention self-serving Ukrainian assertions that lack independent verification. That\u2019s not to say that mainstream coverage is always wrong; it\u2019s mostly just frenetic and fulsome. But don\u2019t even think about calling it propaganda.\n\nI find the situation frightening and deplorable. Frightening because any direct involvement by U.S. forces could escalate into nuclear war, starting with Russia\u2019s use of tactical nuclear weapons (which it has in abundance) to stop troop flows and arms shipments. Deplorable because the U.S. (and British) media have stoked an inferno of self-righteous rage, all in support of a country that has little strategic significance to the United States (or Britain).\n\nYes, I pity Ukrainians, who are being slaughtered by Russia\u2019s war machine. I hope the Ukrainians win without a prolonged bloodbath. But no, I do not believe that Ukraine\u2019s defeat would lead Russia to attack NATO or recreate the Soviet Union. As the scholar John Mearsheimer has noted, those are fables that Western policy elites tell themselves to deny their own culpability. Nor do I think that guaranteeing that Ukraine will remain neutral, rather than join NATO, will encourage China to think \u201caha, we can attack Taiwan and the U.S. will stay out of it!\u201d Such stories\u2014that diplomacy will make the U.S. \u201clook weak\u201d\u2014are endlessly recycled in every single conflict we enter, which is partly why we stayed in Vietnam and Afghanistan long after any conceivable progress was achievable.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re going to care about Ukraine, maybe we should also start caring about Yemen, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have died miserable deaths due to Saudi Arabia\u2019s attack on a sovereign nation, or about Syria, where our own occupying forces and proxies have displaced 7.1 million people and perpetuated a war that has cost more than 600,000 lives and untold misery (not least due to crippling Western sanctions that starve and impoverish millions), or about our own war crimes in Iraq, where our invasion led directly to the violent deaths of between 184,382 and 207,168 civilians (and hundreds of thousands more indirectly), or Libya, where NATO\u2019s regime change operation turned the most prosperous country in Africa into a fratricidal warlord state with open slave markets.\n\nOur press gives us wall-to-wall images of suffering in Ukraine, including images of bombed-out buildings and murdered civilians that attest to \u201cgenocide.\u201d If one wants to see equally convincing attestations to genocide, take a look at images of Fallujah, Iraq, where the U.S. and allied forces used white phosphorous and cluster bombs (and buried corpses, including some tied and shot, in mass graves) and destroyed 36,000 homes, 60 schools, and 65 mosques. Or, look at Mosul, Iraq, after the U.S. leveled it, with a nary a mention of civilian corpses. Or, Raqqa, Syria.\n\nRussia isn\u2019t the only nation that commits wartime atrocities.\n\nWhich brings us to the question: why does the West hate Putin so much? I have zero doubt that Putin is an autocrat who can be ruthless (as witnessed by the 1999 bombing of Grozny, which the West ambivalently condemned). Nor do I doubt that Russia, like the U.S., but on a smaller scale, meddles in other countries\u2019 elections for strategic purposes (though what Russia did in our 2016 election has been grossly overstated and misrepresented). I am inclined to think, too, though evidence isn\u2019t iron-clad, Putin has approved the assassinations of turncoat spies and journalists. All that is likely true. And yet the U.S. supports ally nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that are far more authoritarian than Putin\u2019s Russia. Nor is Ukraine itself innocent of human rights abuses, including torture, murder, and political repression. What, then, makes us hate Putin so much?\n\nThe answer is threefold. First, Russia\u2019s 2015 intervention in Syria on behalf of its longtime ally, Bashir Assad, ramped up tensions to new heights. The U.S.\u2014which was spending a billion dollars a year to arm supposedly \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d rightly condemned Assad and Russia for war crimes but had little or no interest in atrocities by their own proxies. Because the press focused on Syrian/Russian atrocities, moreover, the American public gained little understanding of Russian motives (namely, to protect their longtime military base in Syria and to prevent a Daesh-type government from replacing Assad).\n\nThen\u2014on the heels of Russian entry into the Syrian conflict\u2014came the Russiagate furor, which was repeatedly distorted and exaggerated by venues like MSNBC, CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, for whom Russiagate was a financial windfall. Amid the blizzard of hyperbolic punditry, 67% of Democrats came to believe that Russia had actually changed vote totals in the 2016 presidential election. The impeachment sagas of 2018 and 2020 more firmly linked Russiagate to the cause of Ukrainians whom Trump stood accused of endangering. The U.S. must arm Ukrainians in their fight against Russia, intoned impeachment lawyer Pamela Karlin, so that \u201cwe don't have to fight them here\u201d (even as the Minsk Accords, in theory, remained in effect). Any number of Congressional Democrats joined her chorus of Red Dawn-style hyperbole.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile\u2014despite their anger over the false Russiagate charges\u2014never really abandoned their Cold War mentality. After Russia invaded Ukraine, they were more than happy to resurrect Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 contention that Russia remained our country\u2019s greatest nemesis. It wasn\u2019t, but the ubiquity of Russophobia among foreign policy elites made his statement self-fulfilling. Lindsay Graham and John McCain\u2014long the GOP\u2019s and most eager and strident hawks\u2014personally advanced Romney\u2019s Cold War narrative by visiting Ukraine in 2017, where they promised to help Ukrainian troops prosecute their war against separatists. When Russia launched its invasion, the GOP finally had its 1980s foreign policy back.\n\nWhat all this leads up to is simply this: if Americans who fly Ukrainian flags actually want to help Ukrainians, they would be well advised to support diplomatic negotiations rather than limitless flows of weaponry. It is highly unlikely that Putin will withdraw without a negotiated settlement that would include a promise that Ukraine will not join NATO, as well as some guarantee that the Ukraine will recognize Crimea as part of Russia and grant autonomy to the Donbas. What Russia might provide, in return, would be war reparations (couched as \u201ceconomic aid\u201d) and recognition of Kosovo. Using Ukrainian proxies to fight for regime change in Russia may seem emotionally satisfying but doesn\u2019t offer a path to peace.",

            "text": "Two months on from the start of the war, Russia seems no closer to achieving its original aims. Even if taken at face value, the recent announcement that the goal is now the capture of Donbas and southern Ukrainian territory, creating a land bridge from Crimea, is a dramatic climbdown from the original goals of conquering the whole country, effecting regime change, and forcing Nato to retreat to the force posture of the mid-1990s.\n\nRevising goals downward so early in a war of choice is, of course, a sign that the Kremlin thinks things are going badly. And there is every reason to think that things are going to get significantly worse for Putin.\n\nFrom the start of the war, western analysis has highlighted the Russian army\u2019s apparent problems with logistics, communication, equipment, training and morale. All of these are issues that could in theory be fixed, greatly improving Russia\u2019s capacity to fight the war. But there are two immediate problems with this. The first is the impact of sanctions, which will continue to put pressure on Russian finances, ultimately limiting the Kremlin\u2019s capacity to spend its way out of the difficulty. Sanctions also pose a challenge to attempts to resupply and repair\u2014let alone upgrade\u2014equipment, because they cover military and technology sales.\n\nThe second problem is time. Russian personnel and equipment losses have been enormous. Repairing and building new vehicles, planes and helicopters is a slow process, and it takes many years to replace lost warships. It also takes time to adequately train soldiers to replace the many thousands killed and wounded. Russia appears to be losing men and weapons more quickly than it can replace them; unless this changes, it spells defeat.\n\nBut even if the Kremlin were able to overcome these problems, there are two further, fundamental challenges concerning the conduct of the war and its aims that are entirely outside its control. These mean Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine will continue to fail.\n\nThe first is that the west seems committed to supplying Ukraine with military assistance for the foreseeable future. The scale of this aid is staggering. The United States alone has provided or pledged $3.4bn in military assistance since the start of the war, including $1.6bn in the last two weeks alone; the top ten countries providing military aid have collectively pledged nearly $6bn. It is impossible for Russia to compete with this.\n\nBeyond the headline figures, the specifics of western aid should also be deeply worrying for the Kremlin. The most obvious problem for Putin is that aid is seemingly being tailored to address the changing character of the war. The UK government, for example, has announced that it will \u201cbackfill\u201d Polish tank capacity, supplying Poland with tanks that will enable the country to supply its own tanks to Ukraine. Like the recent announcement that the US will provide armoured personnel carriers and howitzers, this seems designed to help Ukraine in the fight for its eastern territory.\n\nEarly in the war, concerns about the risk of escalation appeared to be limiting the types of western aid provided to Ukraine. The Kremlin attempted to increase this anxiety, and so choke off the aid supply, by announcing that western supply convoys would be regarded as legitimate targets and by making ominous, if vague, noises about nuclear weapons. The latest round of pledges from western donors suggests that these threats may be causing less concern than previously, or that that they carry less weight because the will to support Ukraine has strengthened. Either is very bad news for Putin, since this was almost the only lever that he could pull to try to slow or stop aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe public acknowledgement by western leaders that the war could last for years is an important signal that they are not shaping policy in expectation of a quick resolution; they are preparing their populations for a long-term commitment to Ukraine. Any hopes that Putin may have pinned on nervousness about this would seem to be misplaced.\n\nThis means that Russia, with its capacity to wage war significantly degraded by the first two months of fighting and with limited (and declining) scope to reverse its losses, will have to deal with an opponent benefitting from a seemingly open-ended supply of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of weapons. That is not sustainable.\n\nThere is a second fundamental issue that Putin is unable to control. In aiming to weaken the west and turn the European strategic clock back, he has triggered the opposite outcome. Although differences inevitably remain, western states look much more united than they have at any point this century, and much more focused on strengthening military capacity in the face of Russian threats. It now looks possible that despite their long histories of neutrality, Finland and Sweden will join Nato. This would be a strategic disaster and a profound humiliation for Russia. Threats intended to prevent their accession seem to be having the reverse effect. Whatever short-term gains the Russian army may make by reducing cities like Mariupol to ruins, the medium- and long-term prospects look disastrous for Putin, and he appears powerless to do anything about it.",

            "text": "Russia-Ukraine War: Is The World Witnessing Another \u2018Cold War\u2019 Era?\n\nBy Mukhtar Ya\u2019u Madobi\n\nOf course, it was true, which is hard to believe. We have been hearing about the first and second world wars and how they were fought, because we never had a chance to witness any of them. Nevertheless, in what appears to be akin to a recipe for the third world war, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin had in Late February authorized a \u2018special military operation\u2019 against the neighboring country, Ukraine. This is to press home his demands about Russia\u2019s refusal to allow Ukraine join the United States and European military alliance, known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO.\n\nThe Russian forces have so far invaded the country, seized many cities, strategic institutions and facilities that are very crucial to Ukraine as a corporate nation. Alas, a lot of people have been killed, wounded while a host of others were sent packing as refugees around the border of neighboring countries. The situation has really led to a critical emergency response as the UN stated that more than 3million Ukrainians have currently plunged into deep humanitarian crises and are in dire need of assistance.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the war, the Russian Federation had for months stationed a large number of troops around the Ukraine border as a precautionary measure for any attempt by the NATO forces to establish their presence in Ukraine. A lot of efforts have been made through mediation by international organizations to avert this unfortunate experience, but no light was found at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThis is due to the obsession of the Ukraine President, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky obsession to join forces with NATO as well as the latter\u2019s long term ambition to also expand their geographical reach downward the eastern Europe so as to establish proximity to Russia by creating a military base in an ally country, specifically the presently war-torn Ukraine.\n\nA lot of pundits, which I shared the same view with, argued that Zelensky was thoughtless to have engaged his country into war with Russia, a fight which he knows clearly that he never stood a chance of winning due to superior military spirits of Russia. Because, the Russian military forces put at 1,014,000 with reserve forces of 2,000,000 are five times greater than Ukrainian military forces of 200,000 and reservists of 500,000. Thus, it is obvious that the latter is no match for the former.\n\nEven though I wasn\u2019t born, from what I have read in history, the present Ukrainian situation is just a replica of the olden days \u2018cold war\u2019 between the two world \u2018super powers\u2019 i.e. the defunct Soviet Union (presently Russia) and the United State of America. It is obvious that they are now fighting a proxy war thereby using Ukraine as a battle ground to flex their muscles and showcase their military prowess.\n\nLet me flash our memories a little back to the era of cold war for the purpose of adequate comprehension of this article.\n\nAfter the Second World War ended with the defeat of Germany, Japan and Italy in the hands of the alliance comprising mainly Great Britain, Soviet Russia and the USA. The United States with its economic wealth and military strength, no doubt, made a matchless contribution to the victory in the War and it was felt that its strengths and leadership would be needed to maintain peace in the post-War world, too. Having contributed significantly to the victory in the war, Soviet Russia was not to be sidelined; the country claimed equal say in deciding on European problems.\n\nNevertheless, not so long after this gentlemen\u2019s agreement, the US and the Soviet Union developed differences about working together for the peace and stability of Europe. There were political and ideological reasons for these differences. The US practiced and preached \u2018democracy\u2019 and \u2018free market\u2019 enterprise as the desirable model of governance, while the Soviet Union believed and practiced governance by a single (communist) party and of state-controlled economy.\n\nThese differences led to feelings of one being threatened by the other. So began the bipolar phase in the world order immediately after the War. The United States and the Soviet Union stood out as two opposite poles around which, to begin with, European politics revolved. While the countries of Western Europe joined hands with the US and called themselves the \u201cFree World\u201d, countries of Eastern Europe became part of the Socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. These two leading countries of rival camps were clubbed under the exclusive, new category of \u201csuper powers\u201d.\n\nRelations between East and West were never cordial. Short of going to war directly, the two camps indulged constantly in political and military competition. This state of affairs was widely called the \u201cCold War\u201d. The Cold War was marked by a great deal of competition in forming military alliances, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO).\n\nNATO was formed in 1949 with the United States, Canada and 10 countries in Western Europe including Belgium, Britain, Netherlands, West Germany, France etc. The Soviet Union then cleverly offered to join the alliance, but NATO turned down the offer because NATO\u2019s real purpose was to stop the spread of the Soviet influence and ideology.\n\nAs a result, the Soviet Union set up in 1955 its own military grouping, the WTO with its allies in Eastern Europe to counter NATO. The original members are; Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania.\n\nHowever, the Soviet Union broke up into the Russian Federation and 14 other Republics in 1991 and the WTO was equally disbanded. All these new states abandoned socialism and embraced Western ideology of \u2018democracy\u2019 and \u2018free market economy\u2019. For example, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland joined NATO on March 12 March 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia joined in March 2004 and Albania joined on 1 April 2009.\n\nIt was regarded as a grand victory for the US as it has recorded victory in the Cold War and it became an object of both admiration and fear. The US became the single remaining super power with the fall of socialism and breakup of the Soviet Union\n\nSo going back to our previous discussion, it is obviously simple to understand why Russia invaded Ukraine all of sudden. It is apparent that NATO-US would have the right to establish a military base in Ukraine soil immediately when it joins the alliance. And this gives them proximity to Russia, which is one of the vicious thorns in their flesh.\n\nIt can be recalled that the US invaded Cuba in 1961 because the Soviet wanted to build a military base in that country. Cuba is a few miles away from the US and the latter felt threatened by the Russian presence back then. So why should NATO and the US now build a military base in Ukraine which is also a few miles away from Moscow, the capital city of Russia? Putin is not stupid. He clearly knows that the moment NATO/US enters Ukraine and establishes a military base, then Russia is vulnerable to attack anytime.\n\nAdditionally, NATO and US breached the 1990 treaty which prevented NATO and US from expanding eastwards of Europe from the then East Germany. As of today, NATO establishes its presence almost everywhere in eastern Europe including Croatia, Poland and other places that are closer to Russia. Thus, getting closer to Russia means NATO and US missiles can strike Moscow very quickly without wasting time.\n\nOver the years, as a result of their vested interests, US-NATO forces have been playing a vital role in creating tensions among various countries in the world. Recall that in 2011, NATO and French forces ransacked Libya and killed Colonel Muammar Ghaddafi of blessed memory. Libya that used to be a prosperous nation has now reduced to a poverty and war-ravaged country in Africa.\n\nAlso, US single-handedly invaded Iraq in 1990, bombed the country and also killed Saddam Hussein, the President. America claimed to have acted on \u2018credible intelligence\u2019 which turned out to be false, saying that Iraq had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction and up to now, none of such was found. Today Iraq lies in ruins with no sober government.\n\nAdditionally, they also pounded on Syria and nearly overthrew its President, Bashar Al-Asaad if not because of Russia\u2019s intervention. For over decade, Syria has been shattered and turned to safe haven, swarmed by criminal elements including terrorists.\n\nAs of today, Afghanistan that used to be a peaceful nation has now become stateless after so many years of war occasioned by the presence of the US after the Russians have left. Today Afghanistan is a total mess.\n\nAs it stands now, US and NATO have started sending military logistics to allied nations which will apparently sneak their way into Ukraine. This is dangerous and it might prove the assertion by Russia that NATO and US wants to enter Ukraine so that it can launch attacks on Russian soil.\n\nBelieve me, when this happens, those staunch allies to Russia including China, India, Syria, Iran, the defiant boy of North Korea and others will surely waste no time in coming to its aid. In fact, North Korea has already started testing ballistic missiles and would be ready to shell her close rival and US ally, South Korea at the glimpse of an opportunity.\n\nSo, is the Third World War knocking on our doors?\n\nHonestly, US and NATO unwarranted activities should be checked, if not, they might wake up one day and decide to replace the government of any country they deem fit with another.\n\nMeanwhile NATO and US should cast aside their greediness of expanding eastward of Europe, especially toward Russia as a mark of respect for the treaty they signed earlier on that regard.\n\nTo the inexperienced Zelensky of Ukraine, who allowed himself to be brainwashed by turning his country into a battlefield for NATO/US and Russian forces, the earlier he shelves his interest in joining that military alliance, the better for him and his country as he never stands a chance of emerging victorious against Russia.\n\nBecause, none of NATO/US forces will engage in direct physical confrontations with fully nuclear missiles armed Russia as a result of the known consequences that might accompany such recklessness.",

Orthodox Christians in both countries observe Easter on Sunday. But as the fighting continued to rage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow on Thursday of rejecting the U.N. proposal. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Russia\u2019s invasion has roiled global markets, revived the NATO alliance and triggered war crimes investigations. It has also opened a rift in the Orthodox Church, pitting the Russian wing and its pro-Kremlin patriarch against Orthodox leaders in Kyiv and around the globe.\n\nOrthodox Christianity is one of the largest Christian communions in the world \u2014 after Catholicism and the Protestant church. Most of its roughly 260 million adherents are concentrated in Europe, Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union.\n\nDespite the ongoing Russian invasion of their country, Ukrainians celebrated Orthodox Easter on April 24. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nIt is the dominant faith in both Russia and Ukraine, where the status of the church has become a source of tension between Moscow and Kyiv. For Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally in the church, Patriarch Kirill, Ukraine is an inseparable part of a greater Russian world \u2014 one with Moscow as its political center and Kyiv as its spiritual hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this, Kirill, 75, has offered a full-throated endorsement of the war, doubling down even as the world recoils at widespread reports of Russian atrocities in Ukraine. His pro-war stance has angered other church leaders, in Ukraine and across the Orthodox faith, many of whom have condemned the war and urged Kirill to reconsider his support.\n\nAs the Orthodox world celebrates its Easter holiday Sunday, here\u2019s how the tensions within the church are playing out:\n\nRussian Orthodox Church\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is one of the largest and most influential in the world, with more than 100 million followers, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2009, Kirill was elected patriarch \u2014 the first since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nAt first, Kirill was seen as a modernizer who might carve out some independence for the church, after his predecessor, Alexiy II, used his political ties to raise the church\u2019s profile after decades of atheist communism. Russian politicians bankrolled the construction of new churches, and religious leaders appeared front and center at state functions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, however, Kirill has solidified his role as an ally of the Kremlin, helping Putin cloak his political and military ambitions in the language of faith.\n\nOn Feb. 23, one day before the invasion, Kirill released a statement praising Putin for his \u201chigh and responsible service to the people of Russia\u201d and describing mandatory military service as \u201can active manifestation of evangelical love for neighbors.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since the war started, Kirill has used his sermons to justify the campaign, portraying it as a struggle against sinful Western culture \u2014 although he is careful to avoid referring to the conflict as a war or invasion that was launched by Russia.\n\nHe has focused almost entirely on what he calls Ukraine\u2019s \u201cextermination\u201d of pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region in the eastern part of the country. Earlier this month, Kirill delivered a sermon urging Russians to rally around the government \u201cduring this difficult time,\u201d the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet the Lord help us unite during this difficult time for our Fatherland, including around the authorities,\u201d the Interfax news agency quoted Kirill as saying at a sermon in Moscow.\n\nUkrainian Orthodox Church \u2014 Moscow Patriarchate\n\nThe vast majority of Ukrainians identify as Orthodox Christian, according to Pew. Their loyalties, however, are split between at least two major ecclesiastical bodies, one being the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is \u201cself-governing\u201d but remains under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nFor centuries, churches in Ukraine and Russia were both under the leadership of the Moscow patriarch. However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the church in Ukraine pressed for \u2014 and obtained \u2014 semiautonomous status in 1990.\n\nBut in recent years, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine, an increasing number of Ukrainian followers have sought to counter what they see as Moscow\u2019s influence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the invasion, those calls have intensified \u2014 and parishioners have grown angry over the Russian Orthodox Church\u2019s support for the war. All of this has put the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its leader, Metropolitan Onuphury, in a precarious position, particularly as reports of civilian massacres and other atrocities mount.\n\nOn Feb. 24, the day of the invasion, Onuphury released a statement calling the military campaign a \u201cdisaster\u201d and appealing to Putin to \u201cimmediately stop the fratricidal war.\u201d\n\nThe war between Russians and Ukrainians \u201cis a repetition of the sin of Cain, who killed his own brother out of envy,\u201d Onuphury said. \u201cSuch a war has no justification either from God or from people.\u201d\n\nThe church has emphasized its role in providing assistance to civilians and presiding over the burial of Ukrainian service members. Some priests have stopped commemorating Kirill in their services or have called on Onuphury to break away from Moscow entirely.\n\nOrthodox Church of Ukraine\n\nThe Orthodox Church of Ukraine is three years old. Its founding was the direct result of the burgeoning movement to peel away from the Russian Orthodox Church and create a purely independent ecclesiastical entity for Ukraine. The church\u2019s recognition by the patriarchate in Turkey angered Moscow, and the Russian Orthodox Church severed its ties with that body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leader of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine is Metropolitan Epiphanius, 43, who has been vocal in his criticism of Putin and the war. Soon after the invasion, Epiphanius released a statement likening the Russian leader to both the Antichrist and Adolf Hitler.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of the Antichrist operates in the leader of Russia, the signs of which the Scriptures reveal to us: pride, devotion to evil, ruthlessness, false religiosity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was Hitler during World War II. This is what Putin has become today.\u201d\n\nThis week, after he visited the devastated city of Chernihiv, Epiphanius urged Ukrainians to continue to fight the Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cSeeing the suffering, destruction, brutal violence and spread of death that Russia brings to every corner of Ukraine ... we understand even better that only the fight against the aggressor [and] his expulsion from our land can bring us a just peace,\u201d he said.\n\nEcumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is one of the world\u2019s oldest institutions. The Orthodox Church has no single leader, but Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is considered its spiritual guide and \u201cfirst among equals\u201d with the other patriarchs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBartholomew has been critical of Moscow and the war, and of Kirill and the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nOn the first day of the invasion, he condemned what he said was an \u201cunprovoked attack by Russia against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nLater, in an interview with CNN Turk, he defended his decision to grant autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and warned that Russia\u2019s aggression and isolation could lead to a \u201cnew Cold War.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole world is against Russia,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cThe distance between Russia and the Western world is getting bigger. It means that we are entering a new Cold War period.\u201d\n\nThe patriarchate has delivered humanitarian aid to the church in Kyiv. On a visit to Poland in late March, Bartholomew denounced the invasion as an \u201catrocious\u201d act.\n\n\u201cIt is simply impossible to imagine how much devastation this atrocious invasion has caused for the Ukrainian people and the entire world,\u201d Bartholomew said at a news briefing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe added that solidarity with Ukrainians \u201cis the only thing that can overcome evil and darkness in the world.\u201d\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "By Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA)\n\nBy Bipandeep Sharma*\n\nThe Arctic region witnessed extensive militarisation during the Second World War. In the Cold War period, despite military exercises conducted by rival blocks\u2014the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact countries\u2014the Arctic remained stable without any confrontation. In fact, the 196-km border between the Soviet Union and Norway (the only NATO-member country to share a border with the Soviet Union) remained peaceful throughout the Cold War. In 1987, with the Cold War in its end-phase, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in his famous \u2018Murmansk Speech\u2019, called for the Arctic as a \u2018Zone of Peace\u2019 and emphasised the need for cooperation in the region. 1\n\nGorbachev\u2019s vision was reciprocated by the West. The first environmental cooperative initiative, called the \u2018Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy\u2019 (AEPS), was signed by eight Arctic states in 1991.2 AEPS was the initiative of government of Finland that resulted in successful conclusion of various cooperative measures to protect the Arctic environment. 3 These eight Arctic states in 1996 signed the Ottawa Declaration which led to the establishment of the Arctic Council.4 Since its formation, the Arctic Council has become an important forum for addressing issues of environment, sustainable development and purveying the socio-economic context in the region.5 The Arctic Council is the most important intergovernmental forum for cooperation between the Arctic states in the high north. The working of the Arctic Council is executed through its six working groups and the decision making within the Council is based on \u2018consensus basis\u2019.\n\nIn February 2022, as a result of Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine, the seven Western Arctic states (A7), 6 five of which are members of NATO,7 have issued a joint statement to \u2018temporarily pause\u2019 their participation in all meetings of the Council and its subsidiary bodies.8 These states argued that the Arctic Council works on the fundamental rules of international law, and Russia, which currently holds the chairmanship of the Arctic Council, has violated it. While describing the action as \u2018regrettable\u2019, Russia, in response, highlighted that the Arctic Council has remained depoliticised, despite the past geopolitical issues.9\n\nThe A7\u2019s decision could have serious implications for the Arctic. First, all the eight Arctic states are at close geographical proximity to one another. Even a temporary suspension of the Arctic Council could challenge its established credibility and decision making. This could enhance geopolitical competition by superseding the existing scientific cooperation, consensus on environmental concerns and other mutually agreed solidarities between the states in the region.\n\nSecond, the Arctic contains multiple existing issues of territorial sovereignty, resource exploitation and disagreements over national/international shipping routes. Suspending the working of the Arctic Council would terminate the existing cooperation, resulting in unwanted strategic competition in the region. Furthermore, in order to protect their own self-interests in the Arctic, a potential military build-up can be expected.\n\nThird, Russia holds the largest territorial and coastal extent in the Arctic. It remains the only state with strong Arctic infrastructure and military capabilities. The Russian Arctic accounts for almost half of the total Arctic population living in the region.10 If the current situation prevails or the A7 countries consider forming any new alliance or forum without Russia, it would polarise the Arctic region, which could lead to dangerous outcomes. Similarly, any such alternative approach/alliance by Russia with non-Arctic states, would further challenge the existing cooperation in the region.11\n\nFourth, the issue of climate change is serious in the Arctic, where the global warming is occurring at thrice the average normal. Suspension of all established cooperation with Russia through Arctic Council, would seriously affect academic and scientific engagements between states on climate research in the region.\n\nFifth, the Arctic Council has become successful in negotiating three important legally binding agreements in the region. These include \u2018Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation\u2019,12\u2018Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response\u2019,13 and the \u2018Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic\u2019.14 Also, all the Arctic states have successfully concluded an \u2018International Agreement on Prevention of Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean\u2019.15 As a counter measure to A7\u2019s decision on the Arctic Council, Russia may consider withdrawing from these important agreements in the Arctic, which would further lead to greater insecurities in the region.\n\nSixth, apart from the Arctic permanent states, there are 13 non-Arctic observer states in the Arctic Council.16 Though these states remain outside the decision-making process of the Council, they are actively engaged in the various working groups of the Council. Asian observers such as India, China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea face vulnerabilities as a result of climate change in the Arctic. A pause in the Working Groups of the Arctic Council will have significant implications for the ongoing and future projects undertaken by these states.\n\nFinally, the ongoing debate within the Finish and the Swedish parliaments to join NATO membership will make the revival of the Arctic Council difficult, if not impossible. As and when these two Arctic Council members join NATO, it will have significant geopolitical repercussions for the region. Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, has already warned of Russia\u2019s nuclear and hypersonic deployments, if Finland and Sweden secured NATO membership.17\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Arctic Council, till recently, has proved itself to be a successful model of cooperation. Security issues were consciously kept away from the charter of the Arctic Council. The heightened political contestations in the wake of Russia\u2013Ukraine war could radically alter the spirit as well as structure of the Council. With Finland and Sweden seeking membership of NATO, the situation in the region will, in all likelihood, aggravate further. How the Arctic Council responds to these developments and whether it will remould itself is a moot question.\n\nViews expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Manohar Parrrikar IDSA or of the Government of India.\n\n*About the author: Bipandeep Sharma is a Research Analyst at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.\n\nSource: This article was published by Manohar Parrrikar IDSA",

It was the second colliery accident in just four days in the Jastrzebie-Zdroj coal mining region, near the Czech border. (AP Photo)\n\n10 Miners Missing After Tremor at 2nd Coal Mine in Poland\n\nWARSAW, Poland\u2014A powerful underground tremor and methane gas discharge hit a second coal mine Saturday in southern Poland, forcing dozens of workers to flee the mine and leaving authorities unable to contact 10 other miners still missing, officials said.\n\nThe accident at 3:40 a.m. Saturday at the Borynia-Zofiowka mine occurred 900 meters (2,950 feet) underground. It was the second colliery accident in just four days in the coal mining region around the town of Jastrzebie-Zdroj, near the Czech border.\n\nRepeated methane blasts since Wednesday at the nearby Pniowek mine have killed five miners, left seven miners and rescue workers missing, and injured dozens of others. The search for those missing at Pniowek was suspended Friday after new blasts late Thursday injured seven rescue workers, some seriously.\n\nBoth mines are operated by the Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa, or JSW, company.\n\nThe company said 52 workers were in the area of the tremor Saturday at the Borynia-Zofiowka mine and 42 of them were able to leave the shaft on their own without injuries. A rescue operation was launched for the 10 missing miners.\n\nBy late Saturday afternoon, rescue workers were 600 meters from the site of the tremor and advancing slowly toward where the missing were expected to be, the JSW company said. But it added that high levels of methane in the area could pose a danger and required caution from the rescue team.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Twitter that this was \u201cdevastating news again\u201d from the mining region and said his prayers are with the missing and their relatives.\n\nPoland relies on its own coal and coal imports for almost 70 percent of its energy needs. Most Polish coal mines are in the southern Silesia region.\n\nThe Polish government has been scaling down the use of coal and recently announced it would end coal imports from Russia by May, part of Poland\u2019s drive to reduce its dependence on Russian energy in response to Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",

            "text": "While Americans focus their political attention on the upcoming November election, there is perhaps a more consequential election in France on Sunday. The sitting President, Emmanuel Macron (La R\u00e9public En Marche! \u2014 The Republic On The Move) is in the second and final round of the Presidential election against Marine Le Pen (Rassemblement National \u2014 National Rally). He is a centrist liberal, pro-European Union, and anti-Russia. She is skeptical of the EU and NATO and is far more supportive of Putin than any other significant Western European politician. Like Trump, her love of the Russian strongman may involve financial ties that have so far remained sub rosa.\n\nIt is a rerun of the 2017 election. But the result will be closer. Last time, Macron swatted the ultra-nationalist Le Pen away by a 2-to-1 margin. But echoing an ominous pan-European authoritarian trend, Le Pen is polling much closer this time. The smart money says Macron will win a close race. But the smart money was on Hillary in 2016. And France\u2019s commitment to Europe, the EU, and NATO will be decided by the outcome.\n\nThe French role in Europe became more significant when Angela Merkel retired. And it holds the European Presidency until July. If Macron wins, the country's commitment to the EU will be unchanged. As will its opposition to Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. And the sanctions against Russia will remain in place. A Le Pen victory would make France\u2019s role on the continent less clear.\n\nLe Pen has moderated her position recently in an attempt to attract enough of the less-educated, white, French working-class to make a viable run at the Presidency. However, what you do when elected is often different from what you said you would do when campaigning. And if Le Pen is elected it is also likely that France will leave NATO. And the country will no longer be a reliable partner against Russia and may water down its sanctions on that war-crime-committing country.\n\nLe Pen has toned down her stance on leaving the European Union. And the Brexit disaster has cooled the ardor of French nationalists to take the economically disastrous step of quitting the EU. But while she may not call for a \u2018Frexit\u2019 she could weaken the economic bloc\u2019s cohesion.\n\nLe Pen is not new to the far-right of French politics. Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the extreme right-wing party \u2018National Front\u201d in 1972. His political philosophy anticipated the 2016 GOP \u2014 with ultra-nationalism based on Islamaphobia and a virulent anti-immigrant stance married to a \u201cfamily values\u201d and \u201claw and order\u201d platform.\n\nLe Pen, p\u00e8re et fille.\n\nWhile not a Holocaust denier, Le Pen said it was impossible there were 6 million victims. He also suggested the WWII Nazi-collaborating French leader Marshal P\u00e9tain was a better man than the leader of the Free French, General DeGaulle. And Le Pen is a fan of bringing the death penalty back to France. I suspect with a preference for its use on minority citizens. He is also a rabid anti-Semite, calling a previous French President, Nicholas Sarkozy, who had Greek Jewish roots, \u2018the Foreigner\u2019.\n\nMarine Le Pen realized that the National Front would not be a significant force in French presidential politics with that overt bigotry. She rebranded it \u201cNational Rally\u201d. And in 2015 even expelled her father from the party. It was a good move. Jean Marie Le Pen did make it to the runoff round of the 2002 French presidential election but received only 18% of the vote against Jaques Chirac. It was the most one-sided French presidential election ever.\n\nLe Pen\u2019s National Rally party is part of a growing nationalist movement in Europe. These far-right parties, such as the Freedom Party of Austria, the Danish People\u2019s Party, the Alternative for Germany, the Lega Nord in Italy, Vox in Spain, and the Swiss People\u2019s Party have made inroads in their respective countries\u2019 national legislatures. And they aspire to join the nationalist parties in Hungary (Fidesz) and Poland (United Right) in taking control of the government.\n\nIf Le Pen should win \u2014 and should US Republicans take back the House and Senate in 2022, and hold them while winning the Presidency in 2024 \u2014 anti-democratic forces would be in a dominant position in the Western World. Just as they are in Russia, China, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa. And let\u2019s also note that Jair Bolsonaro, the President of Brazil, South America\u2019s largest and most populous country publicly suggested in September 2021 he would not accept a defeat in the October 2022 elections. Thus joining anti-democrats in Cuba, Venezuela, and Peru. (Note: these are far-left nationalists, proving that politics is a circle, not a line. And there is little daylight between the authoritarians at either extreme.)\n\nAre we all doomed?",

            "text": "Macron did better than many polls had predicted in the run-up to Sunday's vote | Thomas Coex/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nPARIS \u2014 Emmanuel Macron was reelected as president of France on Sunday but a powerful showing by his far-right rival Marine Le Pen \u2014 her strongest ever \u2014 spells trouble for his second term and sends a warning shot to NATO and the European Union.\n\nThe centrist incumbent swept to victory by a comfortable margin, with some 58.5 percent of the electorate backing him versus 41.5 percent for Le Pen, according to a preliminary tally. That gives Macron a second five-year term.\n\nBut the president\u2019s victory is clouded by the fact that his rival \u2014 an anti-immigration, nationalist candidate who advocates banning the Islamic headscarf in public, has courted Russian President Vladimir Putin and wants to turn the European Union into an \u201calliance of European nations\u201d \u2014 won more votes than any far-right candidate in the history of the French Republic.\n\nMore than 12 million people chose Le Pen, about five million more than during her last presidential bid in 2017 \u2014 an increase that suggests that her strategy of trying to bring her party into the political mainstream has been largely successful.\n\nThe result carries also warnings for the EU and NATO.\n\nIn the midst of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, with footage of bombed-out cities featured daily on TV news, a huge chunk of the French electorate backed a candidate who has called for forming an alliance with Moscow and said she would pull France out of NATO\u2019s integrated command if elected.\n\nIn one of the EU\u2019s founding countries, millions voted for a candidate whose campaign platform advocates dismantling the EU from within by suspending its free-travel rules and downgrading the supremacy of EU law.\n\n\u201cThis result is [the sign] of a great mistrust against our leaders and against European leaders, a message they cannot ignore,\u201d Le Pen told supporters in her concession speech. \u201cVoters have shown they want a strong opposition power to Macron.\u201d\n\nHer strong showing will be seen as a warning in Brussels, which is still rattled by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and is locked in judicial battles with Poland and Hungary over rule-of-law disputes.\n\nBut the most immediate challenge will be for Macron, who embarks on his second term in a deeply divided country where political anger could easily boil over into street protests and violence.\n\nThe president acknowledged those divisions in his victory speech.\n\n\u201cOur country is full of doubts and divisions, so we will need to be strong. But nobody will be left by the wayside,\u201d he said from an octagon-shaped stage set in front of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nUnrest around the corner\n\nWhile the vote means continuity will prevail in France, it also shows that divisions that have plagued French politics for decades are not shrinking, but getting larger with every successive election.\n\nLe Pen is on her third presidential campaign but she has not ruled out another and is by no means finished politically. She has recovered from her defeat in 2017 and significantly expanded her party\u2019s base. In her concession speech, the National Rally party chief struck a combative tone and hinted that she would be leading her troops into battle when voters elect a new French parliament in June.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a striking victory,\u201d Le Pen told cheering supporters in Boulogne, a suburb of Paris that has historically been her party\u2019s home base.\n\nHinting at potential alliances that could strengthen Le Pen\u2019s party even further, far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, who was knocked out in the election\u2019s first round, called for the formation of a \u201cpatriotic bloc\u201d uniting his and Le Pen\u2019s supporters.\n\n\u201cWe must forget our quarrels and unite our forces. It is possible, it is essential, it is our duty. Let\u2019s build the first coalition of the right and the patriots as soon as possible,\u201d Zemmour said after the election results were announced.\n\nMacron crippled the mainstream center-left and center-right forces during his rise to power and Sunday\u2019s vote showed that the once-powerful Socialist and Les R\u00e9publicains parties are beyond saving. Neither party was able to gather more than five percent of votes in the first round, meaning that they will not be eligible to have their campaign expenses reimbursed by the state.\n\nTheir collapse accelerates the reformatting of France\u2019s political landscape, away from a right-left divide, toward a split between nationalist anti-establishment populists and centrist pro-European progressives.\n\nEmbarking on his second term fresh from two years of COVID policies, amid high inflation and the war in Ukraine, Macron is unlikely to enjoy any sort of honeymoon period. Calls have already gone up to kickstart what\u2019s known in France as a \u201csocial third round\u201d of the presidential election \u2014 one that takes place in the streets, in the form of protests. Left-wing voters who held their noses and voted for Macron to keep the far right out of power are particularly motivated to apply pressure to Macron\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a rocky ride,\u201d a top official at Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique en Marche party told POLITICO ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a big wide-ranging protest movement, but I do think we see a range of protests in different parts of the country, some like the Yellow Jacket [grassroots protest movement].\u201d\n\nProtests have already kicked off in French universities, with activists angry about having to choose between the far right and a pro-business candidate. Some leaders of the Yellow Jacket movement, which rocked France in 2018 and 2019, are already calling on citizens to take to the streets.\n\nDiscontent has also spread among leftwing voters, whose candidates were all knocked out of the first round of voting on April 10. Twenty-two percent of the electorate voted for far-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round and were particularly divided over options in the second.\n\nThe France Unbowed party leader emerged as a champion of the left-leaning anti-Macron crowd, scoring highly in suburbs with a large immigrant population and with youth across the country, thanks in part to his green agenda.\n\nAs Macron enters his second term, there will be plenty of opportunities for protest. The president was elected on a platform of reforming state pensions and pushing back the retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65 years old. He also wants to reform and introduce more autonomy in French schools, an ambition that will put him on a collision course with France\u2019s powerful teachers\u2019 unions.\n\nMacron\u2019s first mandate was hardly easy, marred by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Yellow Jacket protests that began over a green fuel tax. This time around, he vows that he has learned from mistakes, and promises a new method aimed at building consensus to push through reforms.\n\nBut with inflation and energy prices going up, many observers believe the country is being primed for a backlash.\n\nThe third round\n\nIn the short term, Macron\u2019s opponents are already readying for battle ahead of the parliamentary election in June. The president needs a majority in the National Assembly to be able to push through his reforms and campaigning is not expected to be easy.\n\nTraditionally, French voters tend to vote the same way in presidential and parliamentary elections, so that the elected president and his government aren\u2019t at loggerheads as they begin their term.\n\nBut for France\u2019s left, the parliamentary election offers an opportunity for revenge. M\u00e9lenchon came a close third in the first round of the presidential election and his camp hopes to capitalize on his success and thwart Macron\u2019s reform plans.\n\nMuch attention will also be on Le Pen\u2019s National Rally, which will face competition or cooperation in the parliamentary election with Zemmour, who garnered 7 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nThe hard right usually fares badly in parliamentary elections as mainstream parties tend to unite to block them out of office. In 2017, the National Rally only got eight seats out of 577, though Le Pen got 33 percent of the vote in the presidential election that year.\n\nLe Pen pitched herself as the spokesperson for the downtrodden, the forgotten French against the urban elites. The French president has vowed to unite the country, but questions over how those voices are heard have never been more acute.\n\nThis article has been updated.",

But here, too, there is a hitch; this hasn’t worked either,” Putin said.\n\nIn his opinion, Russian society “has shown maturity, solidarity,” and supports its armed forces and the efforts “to ensure Russia’s ultimate security and help the people living of Donbass.”\n\nAfter a ‘fiasco’ in the media field, Putin claimed, the West has turned “to terror, to arranging the murder of our journalists.”\n\nHe was referring to Monday’s announcement by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) that it had detained a group of “neo-Nazis” instructed by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) to kill popular Russian TV host and journalist Vladimir Solovyov. Kiev has denied any role in organizing the assassination attempt.\n\n“In this regard, it should be noted of course that we know the names of all the Western handlers, of all members of Western services, primarily the CIA, who are working with Ukrainian security agencies. Apparently, they are giving them such advice,” the Russian leader said.\n\nHe added sarcastically that “This is their attitude towards the rights of journalists, towards the dissemination of information; this is their attitude towards human rights in general.”\n\n“All they care about is their own rights, some cherishing imperial ambitions, others holding on to their colonial past in the old-fashioned way. But this will not work in Russia,” Putin claimed.\n\nWhile the Kremlin has been accusing the West of attempting to divide Russian society, Western countries have been alleging that Moscow suppresses opposition, independent media, and even dissent in general. This kind of criticism has intensified following the launch of the offensive in Ukraine and subsequent measures taken by Moscow to crack down on “fake news” and so-called “foreign agents.”\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.', 'image': 'https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.04/article/6266cb9985f54054ee16cb06.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:33'}

Here’s today’s news.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – FIGHTING\n\nRussia has made small advances after beginning to focus on the full occupation of the Donbas region, but the lack of resources and combat support is making it hard for the Russian troops to occupy the region, the U.K. Defense Ministry has said in an intelligence update. Russia’s Ministry of Defense has proposed that the military handle payments to families of deceased soldiers, suggesting that Russia is trying to hide the extensive war losses from its own population, the update added. Ayumi Fujimoto reports for NBC News.\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine came under Russian fire this morning, delaying train services, Oleksandr Kamyshim chairman of Ukrainian Railways said in a Telegram post. Julian Duplain reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussia has said that it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 96 miles northeast of the border with Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 local time (1800 EST) and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people. Reuters reports.\n\nNine Russian missiles struck infrastructure in Kremenchuk, an industrial city in central Ukraine, yesterday according to a regional leader. “The enemy does not shy away from anything, even on such a holy day,” Dmytro Lunin, an acting governor and head of the Poltava region’s military administration, wrote on Telegram. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussian attacks targeting the towns of Gorske and Zolote in the eastern Luhansk region killed six people on Saturday, the region’s governor, Sergiy Haida has said. Cora Engelbrecht reports for the New York Times.\n\nA series of artillery strikes hit central and east Kharkiv on Saturday, including a large residential area. There were no casualties in the strike on central Kharkiv, officials said. Thomas Gibbons-Neff reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussia is planning a staged referendum in the Ukrainian city of Kherson to justify “its occupation,” according to the U.K.’s Defense Ministry. “The city is key to Russia’s objective of establishing a land bridge to Crimea and dominating southern Ukraine,” the ministry tweeted in an intelligence update. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – MARIUPOL\n\nUkrainian forces are still in full control of the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol and have repelled continuous assaults by Russian infantry, Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Battalion, said yesterday. Ukrainian forces are willing to leave the factory and evacuate the city if given guarantees of safe passage for themselves and hundreds of civilians, Palamar said. Michael Schwirtz reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussian troops may be preparing for a renewed assault on the Azovstal steel plant, according to an update by Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War. BBC News reports.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross issued a statement yesterday saying that it was “deeply alarmed” by the situation in Mariupol. The statement called for unimpeded access to help residents, including hundreds of wounded. Marc Santora and Austin Ramzy report for the New York Times.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – U.S. RESPONSE\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said during an unannounced trip to Kyiv on Sunday that U.S. diplomats would return to Ukraine this week. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to the Ukrainian capital, where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials, making them the highest-level US officials to have traveled to the country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hanlser report for CNN.\n\nBridget Brink, who is currently the ambassador to Slovakia, is expected to be named as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine – a position that has been left vacant since early 2020 under former President Trump’s administration. President Joe Biden will likely nominate her later today. María Paúl and Missy Ryan report for the Washington Post.\n\nAt the meeting in Kyiv, the U.S. pledged more than $700m in military financing to help Ukraine’s war efforts, officials have said. About half of the money will go to Ukraine, while the rest will be split among NATO members and other regional allies. In addition, the US will sell $165m of ammunition to Ukraine. BBC News reports.\n\nRussia is failing in its war aims but Ukraine is succeeding, Blinken said following his and Austin’s meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Reuters reports.\n\nThe United States hopes the war in Ukraine will result in a “weakened” Russia that no longer has the capacity to invade its neighbors, Austin told reporters during his trip to Kyiv. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said. Annabelle Timsit and Julie Yoon report for the Washington Post.\n\nZelenskyy has thanked the US for its “unprecedented” support for Ukraine, following his meeting with Blinken and Austin yesterday. “We appreciate the unprecedented assistance of the United States to Ukraine. I would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, for his personal clear position. To thank all the American people, as well as the Congress for their bicameral and bipartisan support. We see it. We feel it,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukraine’s presidential website reports.\n\nAlina Kabaeva, the woman the U.S. government believes to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend, has been spared sanctions in a last-minute decision. U.S. officials believe that sanctioning Kabaeva would be deemed so personal a blow to Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the U.S.. Vivian Salama, Joe Parkinson and Drew Hinshaw report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMultiple governors have announced that their state National Guards would be sending armored vehicles to Ukraine in response to a request from the Pentagon. Gov. Mike DeWine (R- OH) and Gov. Jim Justice (R – WV) announced that their state National Guards would be providing an unspecified number of M-113 armored personnel carriers, which help move equipment and soldiers “while providing protection from small arms fire and the effects of artillery,” according to press releases from both governors’ offices. Caroline Vakil reports for The Hill.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – GLOBAL RESPONSE\n\nIn recent days Russian authorities have stopped publishing data on government debt, trade statistics and oil production, while lawmakers work on a bill banning lenders from sharing data with foreign states. The growing blackout is part of an effort by the Russian authorities to protect the economy and domestic companies from further sanctions by the West. Limited data means that Washington and Brussels will have less visibility on whether and how their sanctions are working. Georgi Kantchev reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTop Ukrainian officials yesterday expressed disapproval of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of the officer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told NBC in an interview that Guterres is “not really” authorized to speak on behalf of the Ukrainian government. Quint Forget reports for POLITICO.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\n\nRussia has proposed the forced donation of blood by captured Ukrainian soldiers, according to Ukrainian ombudsperson for Human Rights, Lyudmila Denisova. “This fact testifies to the analogy of the atrocities of the Nazis in the concentration camps during the Second World War,” she said in a post on Facebook. Aaron Reich reports for the Jerusalem Post.\n\nGreenpeace activists have sought to block a tanker from delivering Russian oil to Norway, chaining themselves to the vessel in a protest against the war in Ukraine. As of this morning, the Ust Luga product tanker is anchored outside Exxon Mobil’s Slagen oil terminal some 43 miles south of the capital Oslo, according to the vessel tracker Marine Traffic. “Oil is not only at the root of the climate crisis but also of wars and conflicts. I am shocked that Norway operates as a free port for Russian oil, which we know finances Putin’s warfare,” Greenpeace Norway head Frode Pleym said. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine’s postal service has said it was targeted by a cyberattack on Friday following to sale of stamps portraying a Ukrainian soldier making a crude gesture to a Russian warship. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine has asked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a list of equipment that is necessary for the reliable and safe operation of its nuclear facilities during the war. The list specifically mentions radiation measuring instruments, shielding materials, electrical power systems and diesel generators. The IAEA reports.\n\nOTHER U.S. RELATIONS\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said yesterday that the current scale of espionage and cybersecurity threats from China were “unprecedented in history.” He noted that China’s hacking program is larger “than that of every other major nation combined,” adding that China’s targets span nearly every sector of the economy. Monique Balls reports for The Hill.\n\nThe Chinese government is not only mistreating Uyghurs within China’s borders, it is hunting them down abroad with help from countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, according to a new report by the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S.. More than 5,500 Uyghurs outside of China have been targeted by Beijing, hit with cyberattacks and threats to family members who remain in China, and more than 1,500 Uyghurs have been detained or forced to return to China to face imprisonment and torture in police custody, according to the report. Anna Schecter reports for NBC News.\n\nPresident Biden yesterday issued a statement memorializing the Armenian genocide. “Let us redouble our efforts toward healing and building the better, more peaceful world that we wish for our children … A world where human rights are respected, where the evils of bigotry and intolerance do not mark our daily lives, and where people everywhere are free to pursue their lives in dignity and security,” the statement said. David Cohen reports for POLITICO.\n\nOTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nEmmanuel Macron won a second term as president of France yesterday, triumphing over his far-right challenger, Marine Le Pen. Projections at the close of voting, which are generally reliable, showed Macron gaining 58.5 per cent of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5 per cent. His victory was much narrower than in 2017 when the margin was 66.1 per cent to 33.9 per cent for Le Pen. Roger Cohen reports for the New York Times.\n\nPreliminary results for Slovenia’s parliamentary elections show that right-wing Prime Minister Janez Jansa has lost to centrist rivals. With 95 per cent of the vote counted, results indicated that Jansa’s Slovenian Democratic Party had won around 24 per cent of the vote. That is far behind the 34 per cent of its main rival, the centrist Freedom Movement, meaning that Jansa is highly unlikely to keep his post as prime minister. Andrew Higgins reports for the New York Times.\n\nIsrael yesterday closed its civilian border crossing with the Gaza Strip, preventing thousands of Gazans from getting to work in Israel, in an effort to pressure Gaza’s ruler Hamas to halt rocket attacks against southern Israel. The closure comes after Palestinian militants fired two rockets at Israel Friday night and one on Saturday morning. Dov Lieber reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHundreds of Arab militia fighters, attacked a village in Sudan’s western Darfur region yesterday, torching homes and shops and killing at least 150 people, according to aid groups and U.N. officials.

"Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness."\n\nThe ministry added that, so far, Russia has only made "minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas."\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," the ministry said.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was scheduled to travel to Turkey on Monday and then Moscow and Kyiv. Zelenskyy said it was a mistake for Guterres to visit Russia before Ukraine.\n\n"Why? To hand over signals from Russia? What should we look for?" Zelenskyy said Saturday. "There are no corpses scattered on the Kutuzovsky Prospect," he said, referring to one of Moscow\'s main avenues.\n\nIn a boost in support for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to dilute France\'s ties with the European Union and NATO. Le Pen had also spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.\n\nMacron\'s victory was hailed by France\'s allies in the EU as a reassuring sign of stability and continued support for Ukraine. France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons systems to Ukraine.\n\n"We have a lot to do and the war in Ukraine reminds us that we are going through tragic times where France must make its voice heard," Macron told a cheering crowd in his victory speech.\n\nZelenskyy\'s meeting with U.S. officials, his first face-to-face talks with a top American official since a Feb. 19 meeting in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris, took place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter. Speaking from Kyiv\'s ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted its significance to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\n\n"The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!" he said.\n\nTo Ukraine\'s north on the Russian side of the border, a fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot, but no immediate cause was given for the blaze in oil storage tanks.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires showed something burning at coordinates that corresponded to a Rosneft facility some 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Moscow previously has blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nSince failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians have aimed to gain full control over the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war.\n\nFor the Donbas offensive, Russia has reassembled troops who fought around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine. The British Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week and "inflicted significant cost on Russian forces."\n\nIn the south of the Donbas, in the strategic port city of Mariupol, a small pocket of Ukrainian troops continues to hold out against Russian forces in the Azovstal steel factory, a sprawling facility on the waterfront.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the building.\n\nNew satellite images by Planet Labs PBC, taken Sunday, show destroyed buildings across the steelworks and smoke rising from one part of the facility. Roofs have gaping holes; a soccer field is cratered from incoming fire.\n\nMore than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate more than 20,000 civilians have been killed. Recent satellite images showed what appeared to be mass graves to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nChildren in an underground bunker were seen receiving Easter presents in a video released Sunday by the far-right Azov Battalion, which is among the Ukrainian forces at the steel plant in Mariupol. The group\'s deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, said the video was shot at the plant.\n\nOne toddler is seen wearing homemade diapers made of cellophane and people are seen hanging laundry on makeshift hangers.\n\n"Please help us," one woman in the video said through tears, appealing to world leaders.

In addition, Blinken and Austin have announced the provision of more than $700 million in additional direct and indirect military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAt the heart of their talks with President, Volodymyr Zelensky was Kyiv\'s demand for heavier weapons to stop the Russian offensive in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe $713 million aid will be distributed between Ukraine and 15 other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. About $322 million is for Kyiv. The rest are allies who have sent aid to Ukraine since the start of the war to get the weapons they need.\n\nThe total amount of military supplies from the United States to Ukraine reached 3.7 billion dollars.\n\n"We do not know how the war will develop from now on, but we know that the existence of a sovereign, independent Ukraine will last much longer than the presence of Vladimir Putin. We will continue to support Ukraine until final success is achieved," said Antony Blinken at a press conference after the visit, adding that it is an expression of American support for the leadership of Ukraine. He added that he had talked with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will visit Moscow and Kyiv this week, to convey a strong message to President Putin to end the war, a truce to be achieved and the evacuation of civilians from dangerous areas to finally occur.\n\nMoscow, for its part, has sent a note to Washington calling for an end to US arms supplies to Ukraine, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said.\n\n"Have we served a note - yes, we have emphasized that it is an unacceptable situation in which the United States is filling Ukraine with weapons," he said, adding that Russia had called for an end to the practice.\n\nBlinken and Austin are the first US government officials to visit Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The war, which entered its third month, killed thousands and killed 5,500 refugees. Kyiv is also seeking help for Ukrainians stranded in the ruined city of Mariupol. According to the mayor, more than 100,000 people are still there and cannot be evacuated. Ukraine\'s defense in Mariupol is on the verge of collapse, admitted Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to President Zelensky. He also said that high-ranking US officials would not have come to Kyiv if "they were not ready to give up weapons".\n\nEarlier, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said that Russian troops not only did not respond to calls for a ceasefire but also prevented the population from leaving Mariupol and seeking refuge in the interior of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the ceasefire, Kyiv insists on safe and several-day humanitarian corridors for civilians who want to leave Mariupol and go to Kyiv-controlled territories. Authorities in Kyiv will also demand the release or exchange of their fighters, who are still trapped at the Azovstal plant.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Zelensky spoke with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to mediate a truce in Mariupol. Turkey views "in principle positively" the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine after the end of the war with Russia. This was stated in a statement issued by the presidential institution in Ankara after Erdogan\'s telephone conversation with Zelensky. Ukraine is pushing for collective security guarantees in exchange for its refusal to join NATO, pushed by Russian demands.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his re-election and said the French president was a "true friend of Ukraine".\n\n"Congratulations to the president and true friend Emmanuel Macron on his election victory," Zelensky wrote on his Twitter account earlier this morning.\n\nMacron is seeking a diplomatic solution to halt the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:12'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield.

France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nTalking to reporters on April 25, Johnson said it is “very important” to have a French president “who can be relied upon” on international issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s not right for friendly governments to comment on elections in neighbouring countries but what I can certainly say is that it is very, very important that Emmanuel and I have been able to work closely together on Ukraine over the last few weeks and months,” he said.\n\n“We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of NATO, has been absolutely vital for the stance we’ve taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I’m very, very reassured by that.”\n\nFrench President and La Republique en Marche party candidate for reelection Emmanuel Macron celebrates after his victory in France’s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

The French government has complained about the UK’s reluctance to issue fishing licences to French fishermen, claiming it was a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly expressed frustration over France’s alleged failure to prevent illegal immigrants from boarding small boats and crossing the English Channel into Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson, who led the Brexit campaign and took the UK out of the EU, has more common ground with Le Pen than Macron on the issue of EU membership.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, though she insisted during the election campaign she had no “secret agenda” this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nMarine Le Pen, presidential candidate, delivers her concession speech after early result projections show France’s incumbent President Emmanuel Macron heading to win a second five-year term as president, in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

Shortly after, the author of this Brief met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who said leaders reeled in shock because Zelenskyy’s video call seemed like a final goodbye.\n\n“One shudders because this man who is asking for help and support may not be alive in the next 48 hours”, Petkov said.\n\nSince then, it has become apparent that the Russian army was not as efficient as we thought, and Ukrainian resistance is not only heroic but potent.\n\nArms started to arrive in Ukraine, Kyiv became safe enough to receive visits from foreign officials, and Zelenskyy addressed parliaments across the world.\n\nRussia re-hashed its strategy, abandoning plans for total dominance via a puppet government and concentrating on territories in the east and south of Ukraine that it still hopes to capture and retain.\n\nChances for a ceasefire are linked with a scenario in which one of the two sides is close to capitulation. But as long as both sides harbour other ambitions – Ukraine to regain most of its territory and Russia to obtain full access to the Black Sea – it is unrealistic to imagine a peace agreement.\n\nBesides, the West now looks set to offer Ukraine whatever weapons it needs, while Russia has no other option but to fight because a defeat is simply not an option for President Vladimir Putin. The main risk factor remains that Putin might be tempted to use arms of mass destruction at some point.\n\nBut if this war remains conventional, as we hope, it is safe to assume that it may last a very long time. And if this is the case, we must concede the war will transform Europe and possibly the world.\n\nThe EU was blind to internal developments in Russia during the run-up to the war, which sought to restore “the glory” of the USSR by force.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU remains over-dependent on Russian oil and gas and vulnerable to Russian propaganda and policy of sowing divisions.\n\nIn hindsight, we can say that the most naïve country was Germany, perceived until recently as our Union’s leader. Conversely, perhaps the most alert country was Poland, who has been fighting a rule-of-law war with the European Commission – a dispute that looks rather unhelpful in the current context.\n\nWhen Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in 2019 that she had ambitions to lead a ‘geopolitical Commission’, she could not know that she would have no other choice three years on. EU policies are changing, taboos are disappearing, and bureaucrats are being pushed out of their comfort zone.\n\nIf, for example, the EU cannot reach an agreement on sanctioning the oil imports from Russia, it should abandon the unanimity rule, which serves nobody else but Putin.

Biden and other NATO heads of state were quick to congratulate the French leader on Twitter, as many feared the implications of nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen defeating Macron. As it turned out, the incumbent beat his Eurosceptic rival handily, by a margin of 58.5% to 41.5%.\n\n“Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his re-election,” Biden tweeted on Sunday. “France is our oldest ally and a key partner in addressing global challenges.

The two leaders haven’t seen completely eye-to-eye on responding to Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine. Macron has called for dialogue with Moscow to help bring peace, and he has chosen not to follow his US counterpart and other NATO leaders in branding Putin a “war criminal” and accusing Russian forces of committing “genocide.” In fact, he suggested earlier this month that such rhetoric isn’t conducive to ending the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“Genocide has a meaning,” Macron said. “The Ukrainian people and Russian people are brotherly people. It’s madness what’s happening today. It’s unbelievable brutality and a return to war in Europe. But at the same time, I look at the facts, and I want to continue to try the utmost to be able to stop the war and restore peace. I’m not sure if the escalation of words serves our cause.”\n\nLate last month, after Biden called Putin a “butcher” and said he “cannot remain in power,” Macron countered that leaders must use restraint in speaking about the crisis. “We want to stop the war that Russia has launched in Ukraine without escalation – that’s the objective,” Macron said. “If this is what we want to do, we should not escalate things – neither with words nor actions.”\n\nThe two leaders also clashed last year, such as when Macron admonished Biden for “abandoning” pro-Western allies in Afghanistan and argued that the countries had a “moral responsibility” toward the Afghan people – remarks that were scrubbed from a White House summary of the conversation. Macron’s administration last September recalled its ambassador to Washington and accused Biden of behaving like Trump after Washington partnered with the UK to persuade Australia to scrap a submarine deal with France and instead buy their vessels.\n\nWhite House calls to foreign leaders are typically arranged by staffers to avoid unscripted moments or gaffes. In March, leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reportedly declined to take calls from Biden, who was expected to urge them to ramp up oil production amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.', 'image': 'https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.04/article/6266f1f385f54062be603df2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:27'}

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France.

Photo: VCG\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron for his reelection victory. Xi gave high credit to the development of bilateral relations in the past five years under Macron\'s governance, and stressed that the stable development of ties has grown more prominent amid the increasingly complicated international atmosphere.Observers believe that in his second term, Macron will try to lead France, as well as the EU, to seek more strategic autonomy, and continue to seek cooperation with China, as alienating Russia has put France and the EU in dire need of cooperation with others, especially China.Macron\'s victory is also a relief for the EU and the US, which were concerned that a victory for his far-right competitor would splinter EU unity and send political shockwaves throughout the continent. However, Chinese observers predicted Macron\'s victory will hardly guarantee him or France the power to further solidify the bloc as it faces "divergence on principles" brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The widely watched French election came to a close on Sunday with Macron taking 58.55 percent of the vote, fending off the challenge from his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen. This also made Macron the first French leader to get reelected as president in 20 years.Xi on Monday sent a congratulatory message to Macron. In his message, Xi said that over the past five years, the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has maintained a high level of development under the guidance of the two heads of state.The two sides have continued to deepen practical cooperation in various fields, combated the COVID-19 pandemic shoulder to shoulder, jointly upheld multilateralism and improved global governance, injecting new impetus into the development of China-European Union relations and making new contributions to world peace, stability and prosperity, Xi said.Speaking on Macron\'s victory, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also said that China is willing to work with France, and other EU countries, to deepen the strategic partnership between China and the bloc, to inject much needed stability and positive energy into the turbulent world.Macron\'s victory has eased the anxiety of Western powers, which feared the election of a nationalist, eurosceptic Le Pen would have wreaked havoc on the unity of EU, as well as the West\'s anti-Russia alliance, as Le Pen has been a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.In what Reuters called a "sign of relief," European leaders were quick to congratulate Macron on his victory. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the first foreign leader to call Macron and congratulate him on his reelection, France 24 quoted Scholz\'s office as saying. "Your voters have sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today. I am happy that we will continue our good cooperation," Scholz wrote on Twitter.European Council president Charles Michel and the prime ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg were also among the first group to congratulate Macron, followed by almost all of the bloc\'s 27 leaders.Putin also sent Macron a message of congratulations, Russian news agencies quoted the Kremlin as saying.US President Joe Biden congratulated Macron on his reelection Sunday (US time), calling France a "key partner in addressing global challenges."However, Chinese observers said that the increasing number of voters who cast their ballots for Le Pen, who takes a hostile stance against the EU and NATO, should ring alarm bells for those two blocs, as it signals rising dissatisfaction against them among the general public in France, one of the EU\'s most pivotal countries.According to Bloomberg, Le Pen got around 2.9 million more votes than in 2017, when she also faced Macron in the presidential run-off, while Macron lost about 2 million votes.With former German chancellor Angela Merkel bowing out of political life, the onus falls on Macron to take up the mantle of European leadership and seek a more independent EU, said Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. However, the French president may find the task an extremely difficult one, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict showed that the divergences among EU countries are not only about their interests, but also about their principles.Divergences remain between countries such as Germany and France and among Eastern European countries in their reaction to Russia over the Ukraine crisis. For example, countries such as Germany and France advocate solving the crisis via dialogue and are more reluctant to slap tough sanctions as they may backfire, and Eastern European countries, such as Poland, are all for a tough response against Russia, said experts.Observers also noted that the current crisis will only deepen differences among European countries over strategic autonomy - countries such as France and Germany support the concept while some Eastern European countries disagree amid concerns they may lose defensive support from the US."There\'s little room for Macron, or France, to strengthen the unity of the bloc given the rising problems, unless it finds a new mechanism, because the old way clearly doesn\'t work well," said Cui.\n\nSupporters cheer after the victory of Emmanuel Macron in France\'s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars, in Paris, on April 24, 2022. Photo: AFP\n\nZheng Ruolin, a senior Chinese media professional and European studies expert who has lived in France for several years, expected Macron to roll out a slew of important policies in his second term, such as keeping its distance with the US, continuing to seek cooperation with China and being proactive toward Russia.Zheng told the Global Times that he also believed Macron\'s first visit to Asia will be to China, just as it was when he won the presidential election five years ago.In his congratulatory message to Macron, Xi also emphasized that both China and France are major countries with a tradition of staying independent. Xi said the strategic significance of the sound and stable development of China-France relations has become ever more prominent as the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes.In the latest bilateral exchanges between leaders of the two countries in February, Macron said in a phone conversation that during its rotating presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of this year, France will make all-out efforts to advance the positive agenda between the EU and China, and work together with China to ensure the success of the EU-China Leaders\' Meeting and push forward the development of EU-China relations. France hopes that progress will be made in the ratification and entry into force of the EU-China investment agreement.Song Luzheng, a France-based research fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University, said that Macron is a firm supporter of strategic autonomy and it is not difficult for him to see that what EU currently needs is to reduce its dependence on the US. In this way, France and the whole of EU, when facing the risk of cutting themselves off from Russia, are in even greater need of China.Song is also optimistic that during Macron\'s second term, China-France and China-EU relations will see some breakthroughs.However, the prospects are far from bright. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European politicians have been pressuring China to vocally criticize Russia, despite China\'s repeated call to not add fuel to the fire and to promote dialogue. Other disputes have also cast a shadow over bilateral ties, such as EU\'s criticism of China\'s response to Lithuania after the tiny Baltic country touched on China\'s red-button Taiwan question.Moreover, the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment was stalled by the unilateral freeze undertaken by the European Parliament in May 2021.But despite these challenges, economic and trade ties between the two remain strong and continue to expand. In the first two months of 2022, the EU surpassed ASEAN as China\'s biggest trading partner after losing the spot in 2021, as trade between China and the EU surged 14.8 percent year-on-year to $137.16 billion.The conflicts exist and will be there in the future, but China and EU have established a smooth dialogue mechanism that enables the two to negotiate through those problems, said experts.They noted that the EU needs to realize that at a strategic level, China and the bloc need each other, and for such cooperation to work smoothly, bilateral relations should not be disrupted by issues such as Ukraine, Lithuania and ideological issues.', 'image': 'https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-04-25/26115692-8873-4031-92a5-8fc89f398f54.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:43'}

The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help.

"Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\n"The difficulties are going to start real soon," Teinturier told AFP.\n\nOverseas territories reject Macron: Voters choose Le Pen after voting Mélenchon in 1st round 01:53\n\nDisenchantment\n\nAddressing supporters late on Sunday, Macron vowed to heal rifts in a deeply divided country, promising a response to the "anger" that prompted many French to vote for the far right.\n\nTurnout was the lowest in any presidential election second-round run-off since 1969 and, in another striking sign of disenchantment with politics, 8.6 percent of people who showed up to vote either submitted a blank or nullified ballot in protest.\n\n"We need to respond to the angry and worried messages from millions of French people who say, \'I can\'t make ends meet\'," Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Monday.\n\nThe 44-year-old president now faces parliamentary elections in June, where keeping a majority will be critical for his ambitions.\n\n"Macron\'s biggest challenge will be to create a sense of cohesion in an extremely fragmented country," said Tara Varma, senior policy fellow and head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\'Victory without triumph\'\n\nFrench daily Le Monde called Macron\'s win "an evening of victory without a triumph".\n\nConservative daily Le Figaro said Macron\'s win was "no mean feat" but also asked: "Who can possibly believe that it is rooted in popular support?"\n\nWithin the next two weeks Macron is expected to reshuffle his government, with the departure of Prime Minister Jean Castex a near certainty, and several other ministers also likely to be replaced.\n\n"Many in government are exhausted and he needs new blood," said one Élysée official who asked not to be named.\n\nMacron will aim for gender parity in his next cabinet and has said he would like to see a woman become his next prime minister.\n\nFor Le Pen, 53, her third defeat in a presidential poll was a bitter pill after years of trying to soften her far-right image to make herself more electable. But she made clear she still had political ambitions.\n\nLe Pen said on Sunday she would "never abandon" the French and declared that she had scored a "brilliant victory" in her defeat.\n\nFor the upcoming parliamentary elections, her party has not formed an alliance with that of far-right rival Éric Zemmour, who scored 7 percent in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nSenior Le Pen aide Jean-Philippe Tanguy said Monday that Zemmour would have to acknowledge that she was the leader of the opposition.\n\nFrench parties look to win seats in June parliamentary election 01:40\n\nRelief among allies\n\nMacron will now try to implement his vision of more pro-business reforms and tighter EU integration after a first term overshadowed by protests, then the coronavirus pandemic and finally Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron\'s re-election sparked relief across Europe, where he has been seen as a guarantor of continuity.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news", European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said she was "delighted" and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters had "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nUS President Joe Biden, Canada\'s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Australian premier Scott Morrison also welcomed his win.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin – whom Macron had unsuccessfully sought to persuade to end the invasion of Ukraine – said Monday he wished the French president "success in your state activities, as well as good health and well-being".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Macron "a true friend of Ukraine".\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/07fd6986-c525-11ec-9a8a-005056bf8594/w:1280/p:16x9/macron-emotion.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:38'}

As one campaign ended, another quickly began.\n\nThe 70-year-old is now seeking to line up an "intergroup" of left-wing allies in the National Assembly that would allow him to force a power-sharing “cohabitation” government with President Emmanuel Macron’s La Republic on the Move (LREM) party.\n\nWith nearly 22 percent of the first round vote, Mélenchon feels he’s in a strong position to build a so-called “New Popular Union” around himself and LFI.\n\nSo what alliances will the far-left kingmaker be able to forge with parties that declined to join forces with him in the presidential polls?\n\nConditions\n\nAs it courts potential allies, LFI – which is certain to build handsomely on its 17 National Assembly lawmakers – has laid out conditions for any future partnerships. Its main policies of lowering the retirement age to 60 years, raising the minimum wage, price freezes and the ushering in of a “Sixth Republic” are not negotiable.\n\nLFI also wants its own candidates to be allowed to run in the number of constituencies that is proportional to its vote share in the presidentials.

Despite the paltry 1.75 percent of the vote managed by presidential hopeful Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists still enjoy a well-established local power base, with 28 lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nA representative of the Communist Party (PCF) told BFMTV that the “disrespectful” number of constituencies offered to them meant the jury was still out on their involvement in a possible coalition.\n\n"There is still too much uncertainty to say whether the Communists will accept this agreement or slam the door," the PCF member said.\n\nElsewhere, LFI is also in talks with the New Anti-Capitalist Party, which has responded favourably and has been openly pushing LFI’s notion that the June polls represent a "third round” of the presidential contest.\n\nAll 577 deputy seats in the lower house will be up for grabs on 12 and 19 June, with LREM likely to meet stiff resistance.

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us. Tonight we tell them that we will continue to transform Europe by their side”, she added.\n\nWhile Macron received many congratulations from his European counterparts, he acknowledged his victory was not as self-evident as last time.\n\n“Many of our compatriots voted for me, not to support the ideas I put forward, but to block the extreme right”, he told the crowd, thanking them and committing to address these divisions.\n\n“Our challenge is to restore French unity. The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:02'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:19'}

They added that it was a "sign of Franco-German friendship".\n\nBulgarian President Rumen Radev congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his re-election as President of the French Republic.\n\nIn his congratulatory address, Rumen Radev said that the election victory was an eloquent proof of the state qualities of Emmanuel Macron at a time when Europe and the world are facing new challenges, the presidential press office said.\n\n"Bulgaria highly appreciates the traditionally good relations of friendship and cooperation with the French Republic, based on our shared values, excellent cooperation within the European Union and NATO and our common aspirations to build a united, strong and solidary Europe," he said.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/BNR', 'image': 'https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-04/photo_verybig_214853.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:14'}

The 3ᵉ round, on June 12 and 19, promises to be boiling hot.\n\nOn the evening of the first round, April 10, we wrote that France resembled a still smoldering battlefield, with its dead and wounded, its routed armies and the new strategies developed by military leaders to fight new battles.\n\nIn the aftermath of the second round, which gave a clear victory to Emmanuel Macron (58.54% of the votes cast against 41.46% for Marine Le Pen), the presidential camp has a modest victory. And rightly so. For everyone knows that it is a victory in trompe-l’oeil: it gives the illusion of reality.\n\nIncumbent president already rejected\n\nLet’s look at the figures. Emmanuel Macron obtained 18,779,641 votes on April 24, 2022, i.e. 58.54% of the votes cast, putting him well ahead of the election. But this flattering score falls to 38.52% of the electorate, i.e. the registered voters. In other words, nearly two thirds of the French did not vote Macron. Worse: between 2017 and 2022, Macron lost 1,963,487 votes! This is not the triumph that we would like to believe.\n\nAt the same time, Marine Le Pen totals 13,297,760 votes (27.28% of registered voters) and gains 2,659,285 votes in five years !\n\n63% of the French for a cohabitation\n\nThese figures attest to the rejection of the re-elected president and his policies during his five-year term. It is so true that an OpinionWay poll for Cnews reveals “that one person in three who voted Macron in the second round wants him not to have a majority in the National Assembly.” And 63% of the French registered voters want a cohabitation with the appointment of a Prime Minister from an opposition party.\n\nIn other words, many voters voted for Macron to block Marine Le Pen, but they do not want Macron to govern. Here is France divided, fractured, more divided than ever.\n\nCut up like a puzzle\n\nGone is the France cut in two of our youth, with a permanent confrontation between left and right who governed in turn according to the principle of the pendulum. Here is France cut into small pieces, like a puzzle. If it is true that the first round revealed the tri-polarization of French political life, the second round shows us a France of the elites against a France of the people, a France of the big cities against a France of the rural areas, a France of the “bobos”, happy and rich, and a France of the eternally forgotten, of the poor (there are 10 million of them) who can neither find decent housing, nor heat, nor food, nor entertainment.\n\nIn these conditions, how can one be the president “of all the French”? Macron’s France will become a country regularly shaken by political and social convulsions, like the Gilets jaunes. The legislative elections of June 12 and 19 will give us a glimpse of the turmoil that will shake the country under the Macron presidency.', 'image': 'https://frenchdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Macron1-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:30'}

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:12'}

Far-right Marine Le Pen and veteran leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round of voting, both hope to mobilise voters to form a strong parliamentary opposition to the freshly re-elected president.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nWith a 17-point lead over his far-right rival, Macron secured a decisive victory against Le Pen in Sunday’s presidential run-off, dashing her hopes of an upset win as he did in 2017. But Le Pen made major gains, cutting Macron’s margin nearly in half compared to five years ago, when he defeated her 66 points to 34.\n\nLe Pen is keen to channel that momentum into the next round of voting: France’s legislative elections, on June 12 and 19. Speaking shortly after the results were announced Sunday, she urged her supporters to turn to the “great battle” ahead.\n\n“Tonight we launch the great battle of the legislative elections,” Le Pen said. “I will lead this battle alongside Jordan Bardella, with all those who had the courage to oppose Emmanuel Macron in the second round, with all those who have France at heart.”\n\nLe Pen, herself a member of France’s National Assembly since 2017, representing the northern Pas-de-Calais region, sought to present her party as the leading force of opposition to Macron.\n\n“The National Rally will seek to rally those who want to come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from, in order to field and support candidates everywhere,” she said.\n\nSpeaking on news channel TF1, the National Rally's acting president Bardella described the June elections as the “third round” of presidential voting.\n\n‘The third round begins tonight’\n\nLeftist Mélenchon, for his part, expressed his satisfaction with Le Pen’s defeat.\n\n“It’s very good news for the unity of our people,” Mélenchon said. But he had no kind words for the incumbent. The two finalists on Sunday had the support of “barely over a third of registered voters”, he said, before also turning to the legislative elections.\n\n“Don’t give up,” said Mélenchon, an opposition MP since 2017, representing parts of Marseille. “The third round begins tonight. On June 12 and 19, another world is still possible if you elect a majority of MPs from the new popular union, which must continue to grow.”\n\nAfter Le Pen edged him out in the first round, Mélenchon had called on voters to elect him prime minister in the legislative elections. His campaign director Manuel Bompard still believes he has a chance.\n\nMélenchon can still be prime minister, “not to be prime minister but to pass his platform, freeze prices, raise the minimum wage, and put in place a Sixth Republic”, Bompard said.\n\nÀ toutes et à tous, je dis : ne vous résignez pas.

France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nTalking to reporters on April 25, Johnson said it is “very important” to have a French president “who can be relied upon” on international issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s not right for friendly governments to comment on elections in neighbouring countries but what I can certainly say is that it is very, very important that Emmanuel and I have been able to work closely together on Ukraine over the last few weeks and months,” he said.\n\n“We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of NATO, has been absolutely vital for the stance we’ve taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I’m very, very reassured by that.”\n\nFrench President and La Republique en Marche party candidate for reelection Emmanuel Macron celebrates after his victory in France’s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

The French government has complained about the UK’s reluctance to issue fishing licences to French fishermen, claiming it was a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly expressed frustration over France’s alleged failure to prevent illegal immigrants from boarding small boats and crossing the English Channel into Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson, who led the Brexit campaign and took the UK out of the EU, has more common ground with Le Pen than Macron on the issue of EU membership.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, though she insisted during the election campaign she had no “secret agenda” this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nMarine Le Pen, presidential candidate, delivers her concession speech after early result projections show France’s incumbent President Emmanuel Macron heading to win a second five-year term as president, in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television.

Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television.

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error.

Photo: VCG\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron for his reelection victory. Xi gave high credit to the development of bilateral relations in the past five years under Macron\'s governance, and stressed that the stable development of ties has grown more prominent amid the increasingly complicated international atmosphere.Observers believe that in his second term, Macron will try to lead France, as well as the EU, to seek more strategic autonomy, and continue to seek cooperation with China, as alienating Russia has put France and the EU in dire need of cooperation with others, especially China.Macron\'s victory is also a relief for the EU and the US, which were concerned that a victory for his far-right competitor would splinter EU unity and send political shockwaves throughout the continent. However, Chinese observers predicted Macron\'s victory will hardly guarantee him or France the power to further solidify the bloc as it faces "divergence on principles" brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The widely watched French election came to a close on Sunday with Macron taking 58.55 percent of the vote, fending off the challenge from his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen. This also made Macron the first French leader to get reelected as president in 20 years.Xi on Monday sent a congratulatory message to Macron. In his message, Xi said that over the past five years, the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has maintained a high level of development under the guidance of the two heads of state.The two sides have continued to deepen practical cooperation in various fields, combated the COVID-19 pandemic shoulder to shoulder, jointly upheld multilateralism and improved global governance, injecting new impetus into the development of China-European Union relations and making new contributions to world peace, stability and prosperity, Xi said.Speaking on Macron\'s victory, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also said that China is willing to work with France, and other EU countries, to deepen the strategic partnership between China and the bloc, to inject much needed stability and positive energy into the turbulent world.Macron\'s victory has eased the anxiety of Western powers, which feared the election of a nationalist, eurosceptic Le Pen would have wreaked havoc on the unity of EU, as well as the West\'s anti-Russia alliance, as Le Pen has been a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.In what Reuters called a "sign of relief," European leaders were quick to congratulate Macron on his victory. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the first foreign leader to call Macron and congratulate him on his reelection, France 24 quoted Scholz\'s office as saying. "Your voters have sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today. I am happy that we will continue our good cooperation," Scholz wrote on Twitter.European Council president Charles Michel and the prime ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg were also among the first group to congratulate Macron, followed by almost all of the bloc\'s 27 leaders.Putin also sent Macron a message of congratulations, Russian news agencies quoted the Kremlin as saying.US President Joe Biden congratulated Macron on his reelection Sunday (US time), calling France a "key partner in addressing global challenges."However, Chinese observers said that the increasing number of voters who cast their ballots for Le Pen, who takes a hostile stance against the EU and NATO, should ring alarm bells for those two blocs, as it signals rising dissatisfaction against them among the general public in France, one of the EU\'s most pivotal countries.According to Bloomberg, Le Pen got around 2.9 million more votes than in 2017, when she also faced Macron in the presidential run-off, while Macron lost about 2 million votes.With former German chancellor Angela Merkel bowing out of political life, the onus falls on Macron to take up the mantle of European leadership and seek a more independent EU, said Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. However, the French president may find the task an extremely difficult one, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict showed that the divergences among EU countries are not only about their interests, but also about their principles.Divergences remain between countries such as Germany and France and among Eastern European countries in their reaction to Russia over the Ukraine crisis. For example, countries such as Germany and France advocate solving the crisis via dialogue and are more reluctant to slap tough sanctions as they may backfire, and Eastern European countries, such as Poland, are all for a tough response against Russia, said experts.Observers also noted that the current crisis will only deepen differences among European countries over strategic autonomy - countries such as France and Germany support the concept while some Eastern European countries disagree amid concerns they may lose defensive support from the US."There\'s little room for Macron, or France, to strengthen the unity of the bloc given the rising problems, unless it finds a new mechanism, because the old way clearly doesn\'t work well," said Cui.\n\nSupporters cheer after the victory of Emmanuel Macron in France\'s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars, in Paris, on April 24, 2022. Photo: AFP\n\nZheng Ruolin, a senior Chinese media professional and European studies expert who has lived in France for several years, expected Macron to roll out a slew of important policies in his second term, such as keeping its distance with the US, continuing to seek cooperation with China and being proactive toward Russia.Zheng told the Global Times that he also believed Macron\'s first visit to Asia will be to China, just as it was when he won the presidential election five years ago.In his congratulatory message to Macron, Xi also emphasized that both China and France are major countries with a tradition of staying independent. Xi said the strategic significance of the sound and stable development of China-France relations has become ever more prominent as the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes.In the latest bilateral exchanges between leaders of the two countries in February, Macron said in a phone conversation that during its rotating presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of this year, France will make all-out efforts to advance the positive agenda between the EU and China, and work together with China to ensure the success of the EU-China Leaders\' Meeting and push forward the development of EU-China relations. France hopes that progress will be made in the ratification and entry into force of the EU-China investment agreement.Song Luzheng, a France-based research fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University, said that Macron is a firm supporter of strategic autonomy and it is not difficult for him to see that what EU currently needs is to reduce its dependence on the US. In this way, France and the whole of EU, when facing the risk of cutting themselves off from Russia, are in even greater need of China.Song is also optimistic that during Macron\'s second term, China-France and China-EU relations will see some breakthroughs.However, the prospects are far from bright. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European politicians have been pressuring China to vocally criticize Russia, despite China\'s repeated call to not add fuel to the fire and to promote dialogue. Other disputes have also cast a shadow over bilateral ties, such as EU\'s criticism of China\'s response to Lithuania after the tiny Baltic country touched on China\'s red-button Taiwan question.Moreover, the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment was stalled by the unilateral freeze undertaken by the European Parliament in May 2021.But despite these challenges, economic and trade ties between the two remain strong and continue to expand. In the first two months of 2022, the EU surpassed ASEAN as China\'s biggest trading partner after losing the spot in 2021, as trade between China and the EU surged 14.8 percent year-on-year to $137.16 billion.The conflicts exist and will be there in the future, but China and EU have established a smooth dialogue mechanism that enables the two to negotiate through those problems, said experts.They noted that the EU needs to realize that at a strategic level, China and the bloc need each other, and for such cooperation to work smoothly, bilateral relations should not be disrupted by issues such as Ukraine, Lithuania and ideological issues.', 'image': 'https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-04-25/26115692-8873-4031-92a5-8fc89f398f54.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:43'}

Le Pen\'s result this time around was the best ever for the far right.\n\nMacron acknowledged some of the challenges he now faces in his victory speech Sunday night in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\n“Our country is beset by doubts and divisions,” he said. “Today’s vote requires us to consider all the hardships of people’s lives and to respond effectively to them and to the anger expressed.”\n\nThe French president has a long to-do list, ranging from preparing for key parliamentary elections in June to implementing his long-delayed pension reform plans and dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron also has to contend with an energised far left, many of whom backed far-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round and voted for the incumbent in the final round only to stop a far-right victory.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio.

Despite the paltry 1.75 percent of the vote managed by presidential hopeful Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists still enjoy a well-established local power base, with 28 lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nA representative of the Communist Party (PCF) told BFMTV that the “disrespectful” number of constituencies offered to them meant the jury was still out on their involvement in a possible coalition.\n\n"There is still too much uncertainty to say whether the Communists will accept this agreement or slam the door," the PCF member said.\n\nElsewhere, LFI is also in talks with the New Anti-Capitalist Party, which has responded favourably and has been openly pushing LFI’s notion that the June polls represent a "third round” of the presidential contest.\n\nAll 577 deputy seats in the lower house will be up for grabs on 12 and 19 June, with LREM likely to meet stiff resistance.

The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:02'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:19'}

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:12'}

But many begrudged having to support Macron.\n\nThey see him as a lofty, arrogant manager, who\'s disconnected from their day-to-day worries.\n\nSome therefore even opted to abstain or vote for Le Pen, their priority instead to block Macron from staying in power.\n\nIt\'s far from certain that, presented with the same scenario five years down the road, those Mélenchon supporters who did vote for Macron would do so again.\n\nThat\'s why the president reelect needs to urgently start implementing more left-wing and ecological measures. Macron needs to change his ways and show that he does understand the suffering of those who feel left behind, in order to give left-wing voters the feeling that he is an acceptable alternative.\n\nThe president indicated in his speech he\'d do all this. Now, he needs to follow through with it.\n\nIf he doesn\'t, that could lead to, or at least contribute to, a further stengthened far-right.

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television.

Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France. In twenty years, the Le Pen vote has doubled from the 5.5 million votes collected by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2002. That has not translated into the keys to the presidential palace, but it should result in plenty of seats in the National Assembly.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that Le Pen or her successor will not be able to get closer to the presidency in five years, especially as there is no apparent heir to Macron, and En Marche is primarily a personal political vehicle without deep ideological roots.\n\nAt the same time, Le Pen and Eric Zemmour appear to have killed off the centre-right Republican party, which secured less than 5% in the first round and now lacks the cash to mount an effective campaign in the June legislative elections.\n\nThe June polls will be the real litmus test of the new configuration of French politics.\n\nShould Le Pen and Zemmour work together and mop up some of the Republican votes, it is hard to see how they will not win a sizeable number of seats.

But those two once-dominant parties have just obtained less than 7% of the vote between them in the first presidential round, less than Zemmour’s total and less than a third of Le Pen’s.

Photo: VCG\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron for his reelection victory. Xi gave high credit to the development of bilateral relations in the past five years under Macron\'s governance, and stressed that the stable development of ties has grown more prominent amid the increasingly complicated international atmosphere.Observers believe that in his second term, Macron will try to lead France, as well as the EU, to seek more strategic autonomy, and continue to seek cooperation with China, as alienating Russia has put France and the EU in dire need of cooperation with others, especially China.Macron\'s victory is also a relief for the EU and the US, which were concerned that a victory for his far-right competitor would splinter EU unity and send political shockwaves throughout the continent. However, Chinese observers predicted Macron\'s victory will hardly guarantee him or France the power to further solidify the bloc as it faces "divergence on principles" brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The widely watched French election came to a close on Sunday with Macron taking 58.55 percent of the vote, fending off the challenge from his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen. This also made Macron the first French leader to get reelected as president in 20 years.Xi on Monday sent a congratulatory message to Macron. In his message, Xi said that over the past five years, the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has maintained a high level of development under the guidance of the two heads of state.The two sides have continued to deepen practical cooperation in various fields, combated the COVID-19 pandemic shoulder to shoulder, jointly upheld multilateralism and improved global governance, injecting new impetus into the development of China-European Union relations and making new contributions to world peace, stability and prosperity, Xi said.Speaking on Macron\'s victory, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also said that China is willing to work with France, and other EU countries, to deepen the strategic partnership between China and the bloc, to inject much needed stability and positive energy into the turbulent world.Macron\'s victory has eased the anxiety of Western powers, which feared the election of a nationalist, eurosceptic Le Pen would have wreaked havoc on the unity of EU, as well as the West\'s anti-Russia alliance, as Le Pen has been a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.In what Reuters called a "sign of relief," European leaders were quick to congratulate Macron on his victory. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the first foreign leader to call Macron and congratulate him on his reelection, France 24 quoted Scholz\'s office as saying. "Your voters have sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today. I am happy that we will continue our good cooperation," Scholz wrote on Twitter.European Council president Charles Michel and the prime ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg were also among the first group to congratulate Macron, followed by almost all of the bloc\'s 27 leaders.Putin also sent Macron a message of congratulations, Russian news agencies quoted the Kremlin as saying.US President Joe Biden congratulated Macron on his reelection Sunday (US time), calling France a "key partner in addressing global challenges."However, Chinese observers said that the increasing number of voters who cast their ballots for Le Pen, who takes a hostile stance against the EU and NATO, should ring alarm bells for those two blocs, as it signals rising dissatisfaction against them among the general public in France, one of the EU\'s most pivotal countries.According to Bloomberg, Le Pen got around 2.9 million more votes than in 2017, when she also faced Macron in the presidential run-off, while Macron lost about 2 million votes.With former German chancellor Angela Merkel bowing out of political life, the onus falls on Macron to take up the mantle of European leadership and seek a more independent EU, said Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. However, the French president may find the task an extremely difficult one, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict showed that the divergences among EU countries are not only about their interests, but also about their principles.Divergences remain between countries such as Germany and France and among Eastern European countries in their reaction to Russia over the Ukraine crisis. For example, countries such as Germany and France advocate solving the crisis via dialogue and are more reluctant to slap tough sanctions as they may backfire, and Eastern European countries, such as Poland, are all for a tough response against Russia, said experts.Observers also noted that the current crisis will only deepen differences among European countries over strategic autonomy - countries such as France and Germany support the concept while some Eastern European countries disagree amid concerns they may lose defensive support from the US."There\'s little room for Macron, or France, to strengthen the unity of the bloc given the rising problems, unless it finds a new mechanism, because the old way clearly doesn\'t work well," said Cui.\n\nSupporters cheer after the victory of Emmanuel Macron in France\'s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars, in Paris, on April 24, 2022. Photo: AFP\n\nZheng Ruolin, a senior Chinese media professional and European studies expert who has lived in France for several years, expected Macron to roll out a slew of important policies in his second term, such as keeping its distance with the US, continuing to seek cooperation with China and being proactive toward Russia.Zheng told the Global Times that he also believed Macron\'s first visit to Asia will be to China, just as it was when he won the presidential election five years ago.In his congratulatory message to Macron, Xi also emphasized that both China and France are major countries with a tradition of staying independent. Xi said the strategic significance of the sound and stable development of China-France relations has become ever more prominent as the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes.In the latest bilateral exchanges between leaders of the two countries in February, Macron said in a phone conversation that during its rotating presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of this year, France will make all-out efforts to advance the positive agenda between the EU and China, and work together with China to ensure the success of the EU-China Leaders\' Meeting and push forward the development of EU-China relations. France hopes that progress will be made in the ratification and entry into force of the EU-China investment agreement.Song Luzheng, a France-based research fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University, said that Macron is a firm supporter of strategic autonomy and it is not difficult for him to see that what EU currently needs is to reduce its dependence on the US. In this way, France and the whole of EU, when facing the risk of cutting themselves off from Russia, are in even greater need of China.Song is also optimistic that during Macron\'s second term, China-France and China-EU relations will see some breakthroughs.However, the prospects are far from bright. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European politicians have been pressuring China to vocally criticize Russia, despite China\'s repeated call to not add fuel to the fire and to promote dialogue. Other disputes have also cast a shadow over bilateral ties, such as EU\'s criticism of China\'s response to Lithuania after the tiny Baltic country touched on China\'s red-button Taiwan question.Moreover, the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment was stalled by the unilateral freeze undertaken by the European Parliament in May 2021.But despite these challenges, economic and trade ties between the two remain strong and continue to expand. In the first two months of 2022, the EU surpassed ASEAN as China\'s biggest trading partner after losing the spot in 2021, as trade between China and the EU surged 14.8 percent year-on-year to $137.16 billion.The conflicts exist and will be there in the future, but China and EU have established a smooth dialogue mechanism that enables the two to negotiate through those problems, said experts.They noted that the EU needs to realize that at a strategic level, China and the bloc need each other, and for such cooperation to work smoothly, bilateral relations should not be disrupted by issues such as Ukraine, Lithuania and ideological issues.', 'image': 'https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-04-25/26115692-8873-4031-92a5-8fc89f398f54.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:43'}

By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

This time she managed to gather the votes of all the dissatisfied voters who are fed up with President Macron and his reforms. She promised not only significant economic reforms but also restrictions towards immigrants and all these program priorities are aimed at improving the living standard of those French voters who are suffering from the economic and social crisis caused by the Covid pandemic and also now the situation in Ukraine.”\n\nWhat are the reactions to President Macron’s victory here in the Czech Republic? Is it perceived as good news for the Czech Republic?\n\n“I would say it is great news. Last night, soon after the result was announced, Prime Minister Petr Fiala congratulated Mr. Macron on his reelection and expressed his interest in further developing Czech-French relations; a similar message came from Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky. So for sure this is very good news for the future of Czech-French relations, especially in light of the fact that the French presidency of the European Council will be followed by the Czech presidency, which will provide a great impetus for developing and deepening our bilateral relationship.”\n\nZuzana Šimek | Photo: Association for International Affairs\n\nWhat is the state of Czech-French relations under President Macron? Are the two countries making full use of the potential that is there?\n\n“I think we could make better use of the potential and cooperate more closely and we will see whether President Macron’s reelection will help to take the relationship further. Our bilateral relations are built on the domains of nuclear energy, defense, cultural education and science and nuclear energy has the potential to become a key element of our bilateral relations in view of the present international situation.”', 'image': 'https://english.radio.cz/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/images/fad1c4eb9372fce2b1e0405efb46bd75.jpg?itok=R7dTVQGT', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:07'}

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:02'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:19'}

The 3ᵉ round, on June 12 and 19, promises to be boiling hot.\n\nOn the evening of the first round, April 10, we wrote that France resembled a still smoldering battlefield, with its dead and wounded, its routed armies and the new strategies developed by military leaders to fight new battles.\n\nIn the aftermath of the second round, which gave a clear victory to Emmanuel Macron (58.54% of the votes cast against 41.46% for Marine Le Pen), the presidential camp has a modest victory. And rightly so. For everyone knows that it is a victory in trompe-l’oeil: it gives the illusion of reality.\n\nIncumbent president already rejected\n\nLet’s look at the figures. Emmanuel Macron obtained 18,779,641 votes on April 24, 2022, i.e. 58.54% of the votes cast, putting him well ahead of the election. But this flattering score falls to 38.52% of the electorate, i.e. the registered voters. In other words, nearly two thirds of the French did not vote Macron. Worse: between 2017 and 2022, Macron lost 1,963,487 votes! This is not the triumph that we would like to believe.\n\nAt the same time, Marine Le Pen totals 13,297,760 votes (27.28% of registered voters) and gains 2,659,285 votes in five years !\n\n63% of the French for a cohabitation\n\nThese figures attest to the rejection of the re-elected president and his policies during his five-year term. It is so true that an OpinionWay poll for Cnews reveals “that one person in three who voted Macron in the second round wants him not to have a majority in the National Assembly.” And 63% of the French registered voters want a cohabitation with the appointment of a Prime Minister from an opposition party.\n\nIn other words, many voters voted for Macron to block Marine Le Pen, but they do not want Macron to govern. Here is France divided, fractured, more divided than ever.\n\nCut up like a puzzle\n\nGone is the France cut in two of our youth, with a permanent confrontation between left and right who governed in turn according to the principle of the pendulum. Here is France cut into small pieces, like a puzzle. If it is true that the first round revealed the tri-polarization of French political life, the second round shows us a France of the elites against a France of the people, a France of the big cities against a France of the rural areas, a France of the “bobos”, happy and rich, and a France of the eternally forgotten, of the poor (there are 10 million of them) who can neither find decent housing, nor heat, nor food, nor entertainment.\n\nIn these conditions, how can one be the president “of all the French”? Macron’s France will become a country regularly shaken by political and social convulsions, like the Gilets jaunes. The legislative elections of June 12 and 19 will give us a glimpse of the turmoil that will shake the country under the Macron presidency.', 'image': 'https://frenchdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Macron1-2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:30'}

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002.

"Congratulations Emmanuel Macron."\n\nUkraine\'s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has spoken with Macron several times since Russia\'s invasion on 24 February, congratulated his French counterpart by phone.\n\nOn Twitter, Zelensky called Macron a "true friend of Ukraine."\n\n"I wish him further success for the sake of the (French) people. I appreciate his support and I am convinced that we are moving together towards new common victories," he wrote in both Ukrainian and French.\n\nOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Emmanuel Macron a message of praise for his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin. "I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he said.\n\nOutside of Europe\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first to congratulate Macron, saying he was "looking forward to continuing our work together on the issues that matter most to people in Canada and France – from defending democracy, to fighting climate change, to creating good jobs and economic growth for the middle class".\n\nJoe Biden also welcomed the victory of the outgoing president. "France is our oldest ally and a key partner in addressing global challenges," US President Joe Biden tweeted. "I look forward to our continued close cooperation -- including on supporting Ukraine, defending democracy, and countering climate change."\n\nCongratulations to @EmmanuelMacron on his re-election.

"More than a shared past, our two countries have a future to build," he said in online comments.\n\nSenegalese president Macky Sall sent Macron his "best wishes for success in his second term of office".\n\nIvorian president Alassane Ouattara sent Macron his "warm congratulations" in a Facebook post, saying he looked forward to "continuing with him to strengthen the ties of friendship and cooperation between Côte d’Ivoire and France".\n\nUN bodies\n\nUN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi sent his "warm congratulations" and said his organisation would continue to count on Macron\'s support on the European and world stage "as humanitarian challenges and refugee crises become more serious and complex every day".\n\nWorld Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he looked forward to "continuing the important partnership" with France "for a healthier, safer, fairer world".\n\n(with wires)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/90d32bf8-a16a-11ec-a673-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-03-11T153140Z_428208289_RC2E0T9KBKWL_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-EU-ECONOMY.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:39'}

He added investors should concentrate on the reopening of the economy that is boosting the services sector and giving a surprise lift to construction.\n\n“The recent pull-back in share prices has left the market on an attractive valuation and appears inexpensive versus government bonds,” said Darby.', 'image': 'https://images.mktw.net/im-530706/social', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:39'}

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

FRANCE 24 takes a look at some of the main takeaways from France\'s presidential vote.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nA nation divided\n\nA post-election map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country while Le Pen won backing in the struggling northern industrial heartlands, the Mediterranean south and French overseas territories.\n\nBig city centres, the upper-middle classes and older voters backed Macron while lower-income groups voted overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\nBut according to Mathieu Gallard, research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, it would be a mistake to imagine a country divided between an urban pro-Macron camp and rural Le Pen supporters.\n\n"The biggest fractures are, above all, generational and social," said Gallard.\n\nRising abstention\n\nTurnout was at just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest of any second-round vote in France since 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who made the effort to turn up at voting stations on Sunday cast a protest vote to send the message that neither candidate was acceptable. Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nMacron loses the French territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost 3 million.\n\nLe Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nMacron could only claim victory in the Pacific islands such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris.

A Marine Le Pen presidency would have been a body blow for the EU on a par with Brexit.

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France. In twenty years, the Le Pen vote has doubled from the 5.5 million votes collected by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2002.

Photo: VCG\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron for his reelection victory. Xi gave high credit to the development of bilateral relations in the past five years under Macron\'s governance, and stressed that the stable development of ties has grown more prominent amid the increasingly complicated international atmosphere.Observers believe that in his second term, Macron will try to lead France, as well as the EU, to seek more strategic autonomy, and continue to seek cooperation with China, as alienating Russia has put France and the EU in dire need of cooperation with others, especially China.Macron\'s victory is also a relief for the EU and the US, which were concerned that a victory for his far-right competitor would splinter EU unity and send political shockwaves throughout the continent. However, Chinese observers predicted Macron\'s victory will hardly guarantee him or France the power to further solidify the bloc as it faces "divergence on principles" brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The widely watched French election came to a close on Sunday with Macron taking 58.55 percent of the vote, fending off the challenge from his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen. This also made Macron the first French leader to get reelected as president in 20 years.Xi on Monday sent a congratulatory message to Macron. In his message, Xi said that over the past five years, the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has maintained a high level of development under the guidance of the two heads of state.The two sides have continued to deepen practical cooperation in various fields, combated the COVID-19 pandemic shoulder to shoulder, jointly upheld multilateralism and improved global governance, injecting new impetus into the development of China-European Union relations and making new contributions to world peace, stability and prosperity, Xi said.Speaking on Macron\'s victory, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also said that China is willing to work with France, and other EU countries, to deepen the strategic partnership between China and the bloc, to inject much needed stability and positive energy into the turbulent world.Macron\'s victory has eased the anxiety of Western powers, which feared the election of a nationalist, eurosceptic Le Pen would have wreaked havoc on the unity of EU, as well as the West\'s anti-Russia alliance, as Le Pen has been a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.In what Reuters called a "sign of relief," European leaders were quick to congratulate Macron on his victory. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the first foreign leader to call Macron and congratulate him on his reelection, France 24 quoted Scholz\'s office as saying. "Your voters have sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today. I am happy that we will continue our good cooperation," Scholz wrote on Twitter.European Council president Charles Michel and the prime ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg were also among the first group to congratulate Macron, followed by almost all of the bloc\'s 27 leaders.Putin also sent Macron a message of congratulations, Russian news agencies quoted the Kremlin as saying.US President Joe Biden congratulated Macron on his reelection Sunday (US time), calling France a "key partner in addressing global challenges."However, Chinese observers said that the increasing number of voters who cast their ballots for Le Pen, who takes a hostile stance against the EU and NATO, should ring alarm bells for those two blocs, as it signals rising dissatisfaction against them among the general public in France, one of the EU\'s most pivotal countries.According to Bloomberg, Le Pen got around 2.9 million more votes than in 2017, when she also faced Macron in the presidential run-off, while Macron lost about 2 million votes.With former German chancellor Angela Merkel bowing out of political life, the onus falls on Macron to take up the mantle of European leadership and seek a more independent EU, said Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. However, the French president may find the task an extremely difficult one, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict showed that the divergences among EU countries are not only about their interests, but also about their principles.Divergences remain between countries such as Germany and France and among Eastern European countries in their reaction to Russia over the Ukraine crisis. For example, countries such as Germany and France advocate solving the crisis via dialogue and are more reluctant to slap tough sanctions as they may backfire, and Eastern European countries, such as Poland, are all for a tough response against Russia, said experts.Observers also noted that the current crisis will only deepen differences among European countries over strategic autonomy - countries such as France and Germany support the concept while some Eastern European countries disagree amid concerns they may lose defensive support from the US."There\'s little room for Macron, or France, to strengthen the unity of the bloc given the rising problems, unless it finds a new mechanism, because the old way clearly doesn\'t work well," said Cui.\n\nSupporters cheer after the victory of Emmanuel Macron in France\'s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars, in Paris, on April 24, 2022. Photo: AFP\n\nZheng Ruolin, a senior Chinese media professional and European studies expert who has lived in France for several years, expected Macron to roll out a slew of important policies in his second term, such as keeping its distance with the US, continuing to seek cooperation with China and being proactive toward Russia.Zheng told the Global Times that he also believed Macron\'s first visit to Asia will be to China, just as it was when he won the presidential election five years ago.In his congratulatory message to Macron, Xi also emphasized that both China and France are major countries with a tradition of staying independent. Xi said the strategic significance of the sound and stable development of China-France relations has become ever more prominent as the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes.In the latest bilateral exchanges between leaders of the two countries in February, Macron said in a phone conversation that during its rotating presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of this year, France will make all-out efforts to advance the positive agenda between the EU and China, and work together with China to ensure the success of the EU-China Leaders\' Meeting and push forward the development of EU-China relations. France hopes that progress will be made in the ratification and entry into force of the EU-China investment agreement.Song Luzheng, a France-based research fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University, said that Macron is a firm supporter of strategic autonomy and it is not difficult for him to see that what EU currently needs is to reduce its dependence on the US. In this way, France and the whole of EU, when facing the risk of cutting themselves off from Russia, are in even greater need of China.Song is also optimistic that during Macron\'s second term, China-France and China-EU relations will see some breakthroughs.However, the prospects are far from bright. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European politicians have been pressuring China to vocally criticize Russia, despite China\'s repeated call to not add fuel to the fire and to promote dialogue. Other disputes have also cast a shadow over bilateral ties, such as EU\'s criticism of China\'s response to Lithuania after the tiny Baltic country touched on China\'s red-button Taiwan question.Moreover, the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment was stalled by the unilateral freeze undertaken by the European Parliament in May 2021.But despite these challenges, economic and trade ties between the two remain strong and continue to expand. In the first two months of 2022, the EU surpassed ASEAN as China\'s biggest trading partner after losing the spot in 2021, as trade between China and the EU surged 14.8 percent year-on-year to $137.16 billion.The conflicts exist and will be there in the future, but China and EU have established a smooth dialogue mechanism that enables the two to negotiate through those problems, said experts.They noted that the EU needs to realize that at a strategic level, China and the bloc need each other, and for such cooperation to work smoothly, bilateral relations should not be disrupted by issues such as Ukraine, Lithuania and ideological issues.', 'image': 'https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-04-25/26115692-8873-4031-92a5-8fc89f398f54.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:43'}

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us. Tonight we tell them that we will continue to transform Europe by their side”, she added.\n\nWhile Macron received many congratulations from his European counterparts, he acknowledged his victory was not as self-evident as last time.\n\n“Many of our compatriots voted for me, not to support the ideas I put forward, but to block the extreme right”, he told the crowd, thanking them and committing to address these divisions.\n\n“Our challenge is to restore French unity. The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:02'}

She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:19'}

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:12'}

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

Macron\'s party now faces an uphill battle ahead of June parliamentary elections, with rivals on both left and right vowing to take the fight to him. FRANCE 24 takes a look at some of the main takeaways from France\'s presidential vote.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nA nation divided\n\nA post-election map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country while Le Pen won backing in the struggling northern industrial heartlands, the Mediterranean south and French overseas territories.\n\nBig city centres, the upper-middle classes and older voters backed Macron while lower-income groups voted overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\nBut according to Mathieu Gallard, research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, it would be a mistake to imagine a country divided between an urban pro-Macron camp and rural Le Pen supporters.\n\n"The biggest fractures are, above all, generational and social," said Gallard.\n\nRising abstention\n\nTurnout was at just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest of any second-round vote in France since 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who made the effort to turn up at voting stations on Sunday cast a protest vote to send the message that neither candidate was acceptable. Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nMacron loses the French territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost 3 million.\n\nLe Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nMacron could only claim victory in the Pacific islands such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris.

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France.

Photo: VCG\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron for his reelection victory. Xi gave high credit to the development of bilateral relations in the past five years under Macron\'s governance, and stressed that the stable development of ties has grown more prominent amid the increasingly complicated international atmosphere.Observers believe that in his second term, Macron will try to lead France, as well as the EU, to seek more strategic autonomy, and continue to seek cooperation with China, as alienating Russia has put France and the EU in dire need of cooperation with others, especially China.Macron\'s victory is also a relief for the EU and the US, which were concerned that a victory for his far-right competitor would splinter EU unity and send political shockwaves throughout the continent. However, Chinese observers predicted Macron\'s victory will hardly guarantee him or France the power to further solidify the bloc as it faces "divergence on principles" brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The widely watched French election came to a close on Sunday with Macron taking 58.55 percent of the vote, fending off the challenge from his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen. This also made Macron the first French leader to get reelected as president in 20 years.Xi on Monday sent a congratulatory message to Macron. In his message, Xi said that over the past five years, the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has maintained a high level of development under the guidance of the two heads of state.The two sides have continued to deepen practical cooperation in various fields, combated the COVID-19 pandemic shoulder to shoulder, jointly upheld multilateralism and improved global governance, injecting new impetus into the development of China-European Union relations and making new contributions to world peace, stability and prosperity, Xi said.Speaking on Macron\'s victory, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also said that China is willing to work with France, and other EU countries, to deepen the strategic partnership between China and the bloc, to inject much needed stability and positive energy into the turbulent world.Macron\'s victory has eased the anxiety of Western powers, which feared the election of a nationalist, eurosceptic Le Pen would have wreaked havoc on the unity of EU, as well as the West\'s anti-Russia alliance, as Le Pen has been a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.In what Reuters called a "sign of relief," European leaders were quick to congratulate Macron on his victory. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the first foreign leader to call Macron and congratulate him on his reelection, France 24 quoted Scholz\'s office as saying. "Your voters have sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today. I am happy that we will continue our good cooperation," Scholz wrote on Twitter.European Council president Charles Michel and the prime ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg were also among the first group to congratulate Macron, followed by almost all of the bloc\'s 27 leaders.Putin also sent Macron a message of congratulations, Russian news agencies quoted the Kremlin as saying.US President Joe Biden congratulated Macron on his reelection Sunday (US time), calling France a "key partner in addressing global challenges."However, Chinese observers said that the increasing number of voters who cast their ballots for Le Pen, who takes a hostile stance against the EU and NATO, should ring alarm bells for those two blocs, as it signals rising dissatisfaction against them among the general public in France, one of the EU\'s most pivotal countries.According to Bloomberg, Le Pen got around 2.9 million more votes than in 2017, when she also faced Macron in the presidential run-off, while Macron lost about 2 million votes.With former German chancellor Angela Merkel bowing out of political life, the onus falls on Macron to take up the mantle of European leadership and seek a more independent EU, said Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. However, the French president may find the task an extremely difficult one, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict showed that the divergences among EU countries are not only about their interests, but also about their principles.Divergences remain between countries such as Germany and France and among Eastern European countries in their reaction to Russia over the Ukraine crisis. For example, countries such as Germany and France advocate solving the crisis via dialogue and are more reluctant to slap tough sanctions as they may backfire, and Eastern European countries, such as Poland, are all for a tough response against Russia, said experts.Observers also noted that the current crisis will only deepen differences among European countries over strategic autonomy - countries such as France and Germany support the concept while some Eastern European countries disagree amid concerns they may lose defensive support from the US."There\'s little room for Macron, or France, to strengthen the unity of the bloc given the rising problems, unless it finds a new mechanism, because the old way clearly doesn\'t work well," said Cui.\n\nSupporters cheer after the victory of Emmanuel Macron in France\'s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars, in Paris, on April 24, 2022. Photo: AFP\n\nZheng Ruolin, a senior Chinese media professional and European studies expert who has lived in France for several years, expected Macron to roll out a slew of important policies in his second term, such as keeping its distance with the US, continuing to seek cooperation with China and being proactive toward Russia.Zheng told the Global Times that he also believed Macron\'s first visit to Asia will be to China, just as it was when he won the presidential election five years ago.In his congratulatory message to Macron, Xi also emphasized that both China and France are major countries with a tradition of staying independent. Xi said the strategic significance of the sound and stable development of China-France relations has become ever more prominent as the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes.In the latest bilateral exchanges between leaders of the two countries in February, Macron said in a phone conversation that during its rotating presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of this year, France will make all-out efforts to advance the positive agenda between the EU and China, and work together with China to ensure the success of the EU-China Leaders\' Meeting and push forward the development of EU-China relations. France hopes that progress will be made in the ratification and entry into force of the EU-China investment agreement.Song Luzheng, a France-based research fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University, said that Macron is a firm supporter of strategic autonomy and it is not difficult for him to see that what EU currently needs is to reduce its dependence on the US. In this way, France and the whole of EU, when facing the risk of cutting themselves off from Russia, are in even greater need of China.Song is also optimistic that during Macron\'s second term, China-France and China-EU relations will see some breakthroughs.However, the prospects are far from bright. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European politicians have been pressuring China to vocally criticize Russia, despite China\'s repeated call to not add fuel to the fire and to promote dialogue. Other disputes have also cast a shadow over bilateral ties, such as EU\'s criticism of China\'s response to Lithuania after the tiny Baltic country touched on China\'s red-button Taiwan question.Moreover, the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment was stalled by the unilateral freeze undertaken by the European Parliament in May 2021.But despite these challenges, economic and trade ties between the two remain strong and continue to expand. In the first two months of 2022, the EU surpassed ASEAN as China\'s biggest trading partner after losing the spot in 2021, as trade between China and the EU surged 14.8 percent year-on-year to $137.16 billion.The conflicts exist and will be there in the future, but China and EU have established a smooth dialogue mechanism that enables the two to negotiate through those problems, said experts.They noted that the EU needs to realize that at a strategic level, China and the bloc need each other, and for such cooperation to work smoothly, bilateral relations should not be disrupted by issues such as Ukraine, Lithuania and ideological issues.', 'image': 'https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-04-25/26115692-8873-4031-92a5-8fc89f398f54.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:43'}

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us. Tonight we tell them that we will continue to transform Europe by their side”, she added.\n\nWhile Macron received many congratulations from his European counterparts, he acknowledged his victory was not as self-evident as last time.\n\n“Many of our compatriots voted for me, not to support the ideas I put forward, but to block the extreme right”, he told the crowd, thanking them and committing to address these divisions.\n\n“Our challenge is to restore French unity. The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this? France took over the rotating EU Council presidency on 1 January, just a few months before the first round of the French presidential elections where Emmanuel Macron will seek reelection against mostly right-wing challengers.\n\n(Edited by Georgi Gotev)", 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/w_57636285-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:59'}

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:02'}

Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:19'}

But here, too, there is a hitch; this hasn’t worked either,” Putin said.\n\nIn his opinion, Russian society “has shown maturity, solidarity,” and supports its armed forces and the efforts “to ensure Russia’s ultimate security and help the people living of Donbass.”\n\nAfter a ‘fiasco’ in the media field, Putin claimed, the West has turned “to terror, to arranging the murder of our journalists.”\n\nHe was referring to Monday’s announcement by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) that it had detained a group of “neo-Nazis” instructed by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) to kill popular Russian TV host and journalist Vladimir Solovyov. Kiev has denied any role in organizing the assassination attempt.\n\n“In this regard, it should be noted of course that we know the names of all the Western handlers, of all members of Western services, primarily the CIA, who are working with Ukrainian security agencies.

But this will not work in Russia,” Putin claimed.\n\nWhile the Kremlin has been accusing the West of attempting to divide Russian society, Western countries have been alleging that Moscow suppresses opposition, independent media, and even dissent in general. This kind of criticism has intensified following the launch of the offensive in Ukraine and subsequent measures taken by Moscow to crack down on “fake news” and so-called “foreign agents.”\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

With 95 per cent of the vote counted, results indicated that Jansa’s Slovenian Democratic Party had won around 24 per cent of the vote.

The transactions represent a radical change of fortune for senior princes who funnelled windfalls from oil booms in the 1970s and 1980s into some of the world’s most exclusive markets. “They’ve clearly been cut down to a disciplined, defined regimen and are having to live on that,” said British historian Robert Lacey, who has chronicled the Saudi ruling family since the 1980s.

"Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness."\n\nThe ministry added that, so far, Russia has only made "minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas."\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," the ministry said.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was scheduled to travel to Turkey on Monday and then Moscow and Kyiv. Zelenskyy said it was a mistake for Guterres to visit Russia before Ukraine.\n\n"Why? To hand over signals from Russia? What should we look for?" Zelenskyy said Saturday. "There are no corpses scattered on the Kutuzovsky Prospect," he said, referring to one of Moscow\'s main avenues.\n\nIn a boost in support for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to dilute France\'s ties with the European Union and NATO. Le Pen had also spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.\n\nMacron\'s victory was hailed by France\'s allies in the EU as a reassuring sign of stability and continued support for Ukraine. France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons systems to Ukraine.\n\n"We have a lot to do and the war in Ukraine reminds us that we are going through tragic times where France must make its voice heard," Macron told a cheering crowd in his victory speech.\n\nZelenskyy\'s meeting with U.S. officials, his first face-to-face talks with a top American official since a Feb. 19 meeting in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris, took place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter. Speaking from Kyiv\'s ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted its significance to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\n\n"The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!" he said.\n\nTo Ukraine\'s north on the Russian side of the border, a fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot, but no immediate cause was given for the blaze in oil storage tanks.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires showed something burning at coordinates that corresponded to a Rosneft facility some 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Moscow previously has blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nSince failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians have aimed to gain full control over the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war.\n\nFor the Donbas offensive, Russia has reassembled troops who fought around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine. The British Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week and "inflicted significant cost on Russian forces."\n\nIn the south of the Donbas, in the strategic port city of Mariupol, a small pocket of Ukrainian troops continues to hold out against Russian forces in the Azovstal steel factory, a sprawling facility on the waterfront.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the building.\n\nNew satellite images by Planet Labs PBC, taken Sunday, show destroyed buildings across the steelworks and smoke rising from one part of the facility. Roofs have gaping holes; a soccer field is cratered from incoming fire.\n\nMore than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate more than 20,000 civilians have been killed. Recent satellite images showed what appeared to be mass graves to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nChildren in an underground bunker were seen receiving Easter presents in a video released Sunday by the far-right Azov Battalion, which is among the Ukrainian forces at the steel plant in Mariupol.

About $322 million is for Kyiv. The rest are allies who have sent aid to Ukraine since the start of the war to get the weapons they need.\n\nThe total amount of military supplies from the United States to Ukraine reached 3.7 billion dollars.\n\n"We do not know how the war will develop from now on, but we know that the existence of a sovereign, independent Ukraine will last much longer than the presence of Vladimir Putin. We will continue to support Ukraine until final success is achieved," said Antony Blinken at a press conference after the visit, adding that it is an expression of American support for the leadership of Ukraine. He added that he had talked with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will visit Moscow and Kyiv this week, to convey a strong message to President Putin to end the war, a truce to be achieved and the evacuation of civilians from dangerous areas to finally occur.\n\nMoscow, for its part, has sent a note to Washington calling for an end to US arms supplies to Ukraine, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said.\n\n"Have we served a note - yes, we have emphasized that it is an unacceptable situation in which the United States is filling Ukraine with weapons," he said, adding that Russia had called for an end to the practice.\n\nBlinken and Austin are the first US government officials to visit Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The war, which entered its third month, killed thousands and killed 5,500 refugees. Kyiv is also seeking help for Ukrainians stranded in the ruined city of Mariupol. According to the mayor, more than 100,000 people are still there and cannot be evacuated. Ukraine\'s defense in Mariupol is on the verge of collapse, admitted Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to President Zelensky. He also said that high-ranking US officials would not have come to Kyiv if "they were not ready to give up weapons".\n\nEarlier, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said that Russian troops not only did not respond to calls for a ceasefire but also prevented the population from leaving Mariupol and seeking refuge in the interior of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the ceasefire, Kyiv insists on safe and several-day humanitarian corridors for civilians who want to leave Mariupol and go to Kyiv-controlled territories. Authorities in Kyiv will also demand the release or exchange of their fighters, who are still trapped at the Azovstal plant.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Zelensky spoke with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to mediate a truce in Mariupol. Turkey views "in principle positively" the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine after the end of the war with Russia. This was stated in a statement issued by the presidential institution in Ankara after Erdogan\'s telephone conversation with Zelensky. Ukraine is pushing for collective security guarantees in exchange for its refusal to join NATO, pushed by Russian demands.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his re-election and said the French president was a "true friend of Ukraine".\n\n"Congratulations to the president and true friend Emmanuel Macron on his election victory," Zelensky wrote on his Twitter account earlier this morning.\n\nMacron is seeking a diplomatic solution to halt the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy.

France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nTalking to reporters on April 25, Johnson said it is “very important” to have a French president “who can be relied upon” on international issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s not right for friendly governments to comment on elections in neighbouring countries but what I can certainly say is that it is very, very important that Emmanuel and I have been able to work closely together on Ukraine over the last few weeks and months,” he said.\n\n“We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of NATO, has been absolutely vital for the stance we’ve taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I’m very, very reassured by that.”\n\nFrench President and La Republique en Marche party candidate for reelection Emmanuel Macron celebrates after his victory in France’s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

The French government has complained about the UK’s reluctance to issue fishing licences to French fishermen, claiming it was a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly expressed frustration over France’s alleged failure to prevent illegal immigrants from boarding small boats and crossing the English Channel into Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson, who led the Brexit campaign and took the UK out of the EU, has more common ground with Le Pen than Macron on the issue of EU membership.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, though she insisted during the election campaign she had no “secret agenda” this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nMarine Le Pen, presidential candidate, delivers her concession speech after early result projections show France’s incumbent President Emmanuel Macron heading to win a second five-year term as president, in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

polls suggested he had won a second term as French president.\n\nMr Macron’s rival, nationalist Marine Le Pen, quickly conceded on Sunday night after polls suggested the incumbent had secured at least 57% of the vote.\n\nThe Prime Minister, calling France one of the UK’s “closest and most important allies”, said he was looking forward to working with Mr Macron on bilateral and global issues following his new mandate.\n\nLondon and Paris have endured a tense relationship in recent years, with Mr Macron’s administration outspoken on post-Brexit fishing rights and the Conservative Party administration’s approach to tackling migrants crossing the Channel in small boats.\n\nBut with a second term likely to be confirmed by official results later on Sunday, the UK Government will likely be hoping it paves the way to work more constructively in future.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Mr Johnson said: “Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on your re-election as president of France.\n\n“France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nDavid Lammy, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, congratulated the president for “defeating the far-right to win a historic second term”.\n\nIf the projections hold, centrist Mr Macron would become only the third president since the 1958 founding of modern France to win twice at the ballot box, and the first in 20 years, since incumbent Jacques Chirac trounced Ms Le Pen’s father in 2002.\n\n“This is a victory for democracy and co-operation over nationalism and intolerance,” Mr Lammy added.\n\n“The UK-France relationship is vital for both countries.\n\n“As Putin continues his illegal war in Ukraine, it is more vital than ever that the continent of Europe and our Nato allies remain united in defence of our common security.”\n\nLabour and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer also offered his congratulations to the 44-year-old, adding on Twitter: “The relationship between our countries is based on respect and allyship, and we look forward to that continuing.”\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was “delighted” that her devolved administration could “continue to work in close partnership” with Paris on issues such as “climate change, biodiversity, culture and our common European values”.\n\nMs Le Pen was projected to win between 41.5% and 43% support, an unprecedented result for the far-right and the 53-year-old on her third attempt to win the French presidency.\n\nAnd Mr

Macron\'s party now faces an uphill battle ahead of June parliamentary elections, with rivals on both left and right vowing to take the fight to him. FRANCE 24 takes a look at some of the main takeaways from France\'s presidential vote.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nA nation divided\n\nA post-election map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country while Le Pen won backing in the struggling northern industrial heartlands, the Mediterranean south and French overseas territories.\n\nBig city centres, the upper-middle classes and older voters backed Macron while lower-income groups voted overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\nBut according to Mathieu Gallard, research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, it would be a mistake to imagine a country divided between an urban pro-Macron camp and rural Le Pen supporters.\n\n"The biggest fractures are, above all, generational and social," said Gallard.\n\nRising abstention\n\nTurnout was at just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest of any second-round vote in France since 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who made the effort to turn up at voting stations on Sunday cast a protest vote to send the message that neither candidate was acceptable. Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nMacron loses the French territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost 3 million.\n\nLe Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nMacron could only claim victory in the Pacific islands such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris.

The next day, EU leaders gathered for an extraordinary summit. At that time, they thought the war would only last a few days…\n\nThis seems like ancient history now.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to EU leaders at that summit via video link. Shortly after, the author of this Brief met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who said leaders reeled in shock because Zelenskyy’s video call seemed like a final goodbye.\n\n“One shudders because this man who is asking for help and support may not be alive in the next 48 hours”, Petkov said.\n\nSince then, it has become apparent that the Russian army was not as efficient as we thought, and Ukrainian resistance is not only heroic but potent.\n\nArms started to arrive in Ukraine, Kyiv became safe enough to receive visits from foreign officials, and Zelenskyy addressed parliaments across the world.\n\nRussia re-hashed its strategy, abandoning plans for total dominance via a puppet government and concentrating on territories in the east and south of Ukraine that it still hopes to capture and retain.\n\nChances for a ceasefire are linked with a scenario in which one of the two sides is close to capitulation. But as long as both sides harbour other ambitions – Ukraine to regain most of its territory and Russia to obtain full access to the Black Sea – it is unrealistic to imagine a peace agreement.\n\nBesides, the West now looks set to offer Ukraine whatever weapons it needs, while Russia has no other option but to fight because a defeat is simply not an option for President Vladimir Putin. The main risk factor remains that Putin might be tempted to use arms of mass destruction at some point.\n\nBut if this war remains conventional, as we hope, it is safe to assume that it may last a very long time. And if this is the case, we must concede the war will transform Europe and possibly the world.\n\nThe EU was blind to internal developments in Russia during the run-up to the war, which sought to restore “the glory” of the USSR by force.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU remains over-dependent on Russian oil and gas and vulnerable to Russian propaganda and policy of sowing divisions.\n\nIn hindsight, we can say that the most naïve country was Germany, perceived until recently as our Union’s leader. Conversely, perhaps the most alert country was Poland, who has been fighting a rule-of-law war with the European Commission – a dispute that looks rather unhelpful in the current context.\n\nWhen Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in 2019 that she had ambitions to lead a ‘geopolitical Commission’, she could not know that she would have no other choice three years on. EU policies are changing, taboos are disappearing, and bureaucrats are being pushed out of their comfort zone.\n\nIf, for example, the EU cannot reach an agreement on sanctioning the oil imports from Russia, it should abandon the unanimity rule, which serves nobody else but Putin. This would also significantly reduce the power of nuisance leaders like Viktor Orban.\n\nIt should be up to the Commission to make sure that detractors are excluded from specific funding and opportunities. This is part of building the EU’s resilience.\n\nWhile the war drags on, it is safe to bet that the EU will change more than it has done in decades.\n\nIt is good for Europe that the French President Emmanuel Macron has won a second mandate and that in Slovenia, Eurosceptic Janez Janša was badly beaten.\n\nIf the mainstream politicians take the social challenges in their countries seriously, the far-right politicians, who have already lost Putin as an icon, will be squeezed into the corner.\n\nEuropeans are capable of solidarity and will show the best of themselves and perhaps Europe will have a new generation of war leaders, as it did after World War II.\n\nThe Roundup\n\nWith the ongoing French EU Council presidency and the upcoming parliamentary elections, Emmanuel Macron will enjoy no grace period in his second mandate and the opposition, both on the left and the right, is more determined than ever to strip the newly re-elected president of his parliamentary majority.\n\nTwitter Inc is nearing a deal to sell itself to Elon Musk for $54.20 per share in cash, the price that he originally offered to the social media company and called his ‘best and final’, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIf you want to read up on how Slovenia fared in its parliamentary election on Sunday, we’ve got you covered: Conservatives are out, a progressive government is in.\n\nEurope’s market for hydrogen-powered taxis is becoming increasingly competitive, with French company Hype, which has developed them in Paris since 2015, being among the frontrunners.\n\nThe EU and India are set to announce closer cooperation and an imminent relaunch of negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement on Monday, as part of Western efforts to help decrease the world’s second-most populous country’s dependence on Russia.\n\nLook out for…\n\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee holds public hearing on encouraging engagement of young people towards achieving sustainable development.\n\nCouncil of Europe holds conference on ‘Speaking Human Rights Online’.\n\nViews are the author’s.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Shared-Link-The-Hub-Article-Templates-Options-44-800x450.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:09'}

Biden and other NATO heads of state were quick to congratulate the French leader on Twitter, as many feared the implications of nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen defeating Macron.

The two leaders haven’t seen completely eye-to-eye on responding to Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine. Macron has called for dialogue with Moscow to help bring peace, and he has chosen not to follow his US counterpart and other NATO leaders in branding Putin a “war criminal” and accusing Russian forces of committing “genocide.” In fact, he suggested earlier this month that such rhetoric isn’t conducive to ending the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“Genocide has a meaning,” Macron said. “The Ukrainian people and Russian people are brotherly people. It’s madness what’s happening today. It’s unbelievable brutality and a return to war in Europe. But at the same time, I look at the facts, and I want to continue to try the utmost to be able to stop the war and restore peace. I’m not sure if the escalation of words serves our cause.”\n\nLate last month, after Biden called Putin a “butcher” and said he “cannot remain in power,” Macron countered that leaders must use restraint in speaking about the crisis. “We want to stop the war that Russia has launched in Ukraine without escalation – that’s the objective,” Macron said. “If this is what we want to do, we should not escalate things – neither with words nor actions.”\n\nThe two leaders also clashed last year, such as when Macron admonished Biden for “abandoning” pro-Western allies in Afghanistan and argued that the countries had a “moral responsibility” toward the Afghan people – remarks that were scrubbed from a White House summary of the conversation. Macron’s administration last September recalled its ambassador to Washington and accused Biden of behaving like Trump after Washington partnered with the UK to persuade Australia to scrap a submarine deal with France and instead buy their vessels.\n\nWhite House calls to foreign leaders are typically arranged by staffers to avoid unscripted moments or gaffes. In March, leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reportedly declined to take calls from Biden, who was expected to urge them to ramp up oil production amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.', 'image': 'https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.04/article/6266f1f385f54062be603df2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:27'}

Photo: VCG\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron for his reelection victory. Xi gave high credit to the development of bilateral relations in the past five years under Macron\'s governance, and stressed that the stable development of ties has grown more prominent amid the increasingly complicated international atmosphere.Observers believe that in his second term, Macron will try to lead France, as well as the EU, to seek more strategic autonomy, and continue to seek cooperation with China, as alienating Russia has put France and the EU in dire need of cooperation with others, especially China.Macron\'s victory is also a relief for the EU and the US, which were concerned that a victory for his far-right competitor would splinter EU unity and send political shockwaves throughout the continent. However, Chinese observers predicted Macron\'s victory will hardly guarantee him or France the power to further solidify the bloc as it faces "divergence on principles" brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The widely watched French election came to a close on Sunday with Macron taking 58.55 percent of the vote, fending off the challenge from his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen. This also made Macron the first French leader to get reelected as president in 20 years.Xi on Monday sent a congratulatory message to Macron. In his message, Xi said that over the past five years, the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has maintained a high level of development under the guidance of the two heads of state.The two sides have continued to deepen practical cooperation in various fields, combated the COVID-19 pandemic shoulder to shoulder, jointly upheld multilateralism and improved global governance, injecting new impetus into the development of China-European Union relations and making new contributions to world peace, stability and prosperity, Xi said.Speaking on Macron\'s victory, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also said that China is willing to work with France, and other EU countries, to deepen the strategic partnership between China and the bloc, to inject much needed stability and positive energy into the turbulent world.Macron\'s victory has eased the anxiety of Western powers, which feared the election of a nationalist, eurosceptic Le Pen would have wreaked havoc on the unity of EU, as well as the West\'s anti-Russia alliance, as Le Pen has been a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.In what Reuters called a "sign of relief," European leaders were quick to congratulate Macron on his victory. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the first foreign leader to call Macron and congratulate him on his reelection, France 24 quoted Scholz\'s office as saying. "Your voters have sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today. I am happy that we will continue our good cooperation," Scholz wrote on Twitter.European Council president Charles Michel and the prime ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg were also among the first group to congratulate Macron, followed by almost all of the bloc\'s 27 leaders.Putin also sent Macron a message of congratulations, Russian news agencies quoted the Kremlin as saying.US President Joe Biden congratulated Macron on his reelection Sunday (US time), calling France a "key partner in addressing global challenges."However, Chinese observers said that the increasing number of voters who cast their ballots for Le Pen, who takes a hostile stance against the EU and NATO, should ring alarm bells for those two blocs, as it signals rising dissatisfaction against them among the general public in France, one of the EU\'s most pivotal countries.According to Bloomberg, Le Pen got around 2.9 million more votes than in 2017, when she also faced Macron in the presidential run-off, while Macron lost about 2 million votes.With former German chancellor Angela Merkel bowing out of political life, the onus falls on Macron to take up the mantle of European leadership and seek a more independent EU, said Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. However, the French president may find the task an extremely difficult one, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict showed that the divergences among EU countries are not only about their interests, but also about their principles.Divergences remain between countries such as Germany and France and among Eastern European countries in their reaction to Russia over the Ukraine crisis. For example, countries such as Germany and France advocate solving the crisis via dialogue and are more reluctant to slap tough sanctions as they may backfire, and Eastern European countries, such as Poland, are all for a tough response against Russia, said experts.Observers also noted that the current crisis will only deepen differences among European countries over strategic autonomy - countries such as France and Germany support the concept while some Eastern European countries disagree amid concerns they may lose defensive support from the US."There\'s little room for Macron, or France, to strengthen the unity of the bloc given the rising problems, unless it finds a new mechanism, because the old way clearly doesn\'t work well," said Cui.\n\nSupporters cheer after the victory of Emmanuel Macron in France\'s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars, in Paris, on April 24, 2022. Photo: AFP\n\nZheng Ruolin, a senior Chinese media professional and European studies expert who has lived in France for several years, expected Macron to roll out a slew of important policies in his second term, such as keeping its distance with the US, continuing to seek cooperation with China and being proactive toward Russia.Zheng told the Global Times that he also believed Macron\'s first visit to Asia will be to China, just as it was when he won the presidential election five years ago.In his congratulatory message to Macron, Xi also emphasized that both China and France are major countries with a tradition of staying independent. Xi said the strategic significance of the sound and stable development of China-France relations has become ever more prominent as the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes.In the latest bilateral exchanges between leaders of the two countries in February, Macron said in a phone conversation that during its rotating presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of this year, France will make all-out efforts to advance the positive agenda between the EU and China, and work together with China to ensure the success of the EU-China Leaders\' Meeting and push forward the development of EU-China relations. France hopes that progress will be made in the ratification and entry into force of the EU-China investment agreement.Song Luzheng, a France-based research fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University, said that Macron is a firm supporter of strategic autonomy and it is not difficult for him to see that what EU currently needs is to reduce its dependence on the US. In this way, France and the whole of EU, when facing the risk of cutting themselves off from Russia, are in even greater need of China.Song is also optimistic that during Macron\'s second term, China-France and China-EU relations will see some breakthroughs.However, the prospects are far from bright. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European politicians have been pressuring China to vocally criticize Russia, despite China\'s repeated call to not add fuel to the fire and to promote dialogue. Other disputes have also cast a shadow over bilateral ties, such as EU\'s criticism of China\'s response to Lithuania after the tiny Baltic country touched on China\'s red-button Taiwan question.Moreover, the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment was stalled by the unilateral freeze undertaken by the European Parliament in May 2021.But despite these challenges, economic and trade ties between the two remain strong and continue to expand. In the first two months of 2022, the EU surpassed ASEAN as China\'s biggest trading partner after losing the spot in 2021, as trade between China and the EU surged 14.8 percent year-on-year to $137.16 billion.The conflicts exist and will be there in the future, but China and EU have established a smooth dialogue mechanism that enables the two to negotiate through those problems, said experts.They noted that the EU needs to realize that at a strategic level, China and the bloc need each other, and for such cooperation to work smoothly, bilateral relations should not be disrupted by issues such as Ukraine, Lithuania and ideological issues.', 'image': 'https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-04-25/26115692-8873-4031-92a5-8fc89f398f54.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:43'}

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:51'}

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:02'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:19'}

In 2022, it has done so again – just as Slovenia looks set to eject its nationalist leader.\n\nAn overwhelming display of pro-EU values? Not quite. Macron’s lead is narrower than last time – around 58%, rather than 66% — and turnout was at its lowest in decades. Voter fatigue runs high.\n\nYet visions of an anti-elite “domino” effect after Brexit and Trump are increasingly fading in a post-Ukraine, post-Covid world. The French have voted for a France at the heart, not the fringes, of Europe – albeit one that has to better protect its people.\n\nThere is opportunity here for Macron. France has strategic weight as the EU’s only nuclear power, with an economy that’s outperforming Germany’s and that is less dependent on Russian gas in a time of war and surging energy prices. But it needs better direction.\n\nThe banker-turned-president knows he has to change his governing style at home. His liberal reform agenda is no longer in tune with French support for an enlarged post-Covid state, and will require co-operation with rival parties and trade unions, and burnished green and left-wing credentials.\n\nEven if voters ultimately rejected Le Pen’s call for a shredding of European cooperation and a rapprochement with Russia, her economically left-wing campaign earned her a better score than in 2017. An estimated 17% of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon’s first-round voters backed her in the runoff, according to Ipsos.\n\nMacron’s recent talking points and victory speech reflect a willingness to build a bigger political tent. Provided he navigates the next few months with the right government in tow, he should be able to cobble together a (likely reduced) majority after parliamentary elections in June. Saxo Bank’s Christopher Dembik reckons there’s a less-than 25% chance he’ll fail to do so.\n\nWhile no guarantee against protests or strikes, securing a majority or coalition would lessen the chance of legislative gridlock at a time when France is juggling a debt-to-GDP load of 113% and is under pressure to improve pay and performance in sectors like health and education.\n\nOn the European stage, Macron will also have to strike a new balance of humility and outreach. Unity on sanctions against Russia is fraying, more EU members are set to join NATO (which he once called “brain-dead”) and the political center of gravity is shifting eastward, where Paris has in the past failed to build diplomatic capital. The climate transition, regulating tech platforms and closing corporate-tax loopholes are other items on the agenda.\n\nHere too, there’s an opportunity. France’s geopolitical weight is vital to bolstering a pro-Ukraine stance when it comes to supporting Kyiv financially and militarily, as well as cutting European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Paris’s ability to prod Berlin on these issues will be vital, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the first foreign leader to call Macron after re-election — is under pressure from his coalition to take a clearer line on Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnpicking the region’s energy ties while simultaneously ramping up its defense capabilities will bring costs. A re-elected Macron should use his political momentum to recapture the spirit of the EU’s $1 trillion pandemic recovery plan and push for more spending and solidarity via joint borrowing, as previously proposed in partnership with Italy’s Mario Draghi.\n\nFrench far-right and far-left parties aren’t going anywhere, meanwhile. They will likely command a bigger political presence as two of three big voting blocs (alongside Macron’s centrists) emerging from the rubble of 20th-century Left-Right divides. With Macron unable to serve a third term, the risk of another polarizing standoff in 2027 remains.\n\nStill, Le Pen faces serious pressures of her own, according to Catherine Fieschi, director of Counterpoint. Le Pen bet the farm on a normalization strategy that excised the toxic policy of Frexit and airbrushed her party’s fascist past in favor of cat videos and budget giveaways. Her score just above 40% suggests that, failing a surprise outperformance in June, she has peaked as a presidential contender.\n\nMacron has made history as the first French president to win re-election since 2002. Despite evidence of deep cracks in society, and a reluctance to embrace the president’s pitch for a liberal “revolution,” that still means something. If he fails to deliver on his promise of more protection at home and more projection abroad, it will be a huge missed opportunity.-Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: PM Modi congratulates Macron on reelection, says looking forward to deepen India-France ties', 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Macron-scaled.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:12'}

France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nTalking to reporters on April 25, Johnson said it is “very important” to have a French president “who can be relied upon” on international issues such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s not right for friendly governments to comment on elections in neighbouring countries but what I can certainly say is that it is very, very important that Emmanuel and I have been able to work closely together on Ukraine over the last few weeks and months,” he said.\n\n“We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of NATO, has been absolutely vital for the stance we’ve taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I’m very, very reassured by that.”\n\nFrench President and La Republique en Marche party candidate for reelection Emmanuel Macron celebrates after his victory in France’s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars in Paris, on April 24, 2022.

The French government has complained about the UK’s reluctance to issue fishing licences to French fishermen, claiming it was a breach of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has repeatedly expressed frustration over France’s alleged failure to prevent illegal immigrants from boarding small boats and crossing the English Channel into Britain.\n\nBoris Johnson, who led the Brexit campaign and took the UK out of the EU, has more common ground with Le Pen than Macron on the issue of EU membership.\n\nLe Pen had long flirted with the idea of leaving the bloc, though she insisted during the election campaign she had no “secret agenda” this time for quitting the EU or the euro single currency.\n\nMarine Le Pen, presidential candidate, delivers her concession speech after early result projections show France’s incumbent President Emmanuel Macron heading to win a second five-year term as president, in Paris, on April 24, 2022. (Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images)\n\nDespite the fractious post-Brexit relations between the UK and French governments, the war in Ukraine has recently refocused minds on the issue of European security.\n\nBritain has positioned itself as one of Kyiv’s closest allies both in the run-up to and during the Russian invasion, and has called on other European powers, including France, to do more.\n\nCabinet minister and Conservative Party Chairman Oliver Dowden told Sky News on Sunday, “I think we’ve had very positive noises from France and Germany but I would like to see further action from them.”\n\nThough the UK government is still unsatisfied with Macron’s level of support for Ukraine, his rival Le Pen could not necessarily be counted on to make the same “positive noises.”\n\nDuring the election campaign, Le Pen defended her previous expressions of esteem for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying she had only been defending French interests in her warm contacts with the Kremlin leader.\n\nShe insisted on maintaining good relations with Putin, saying, “As soon as the Russian–Ukrainian war is over and has been settled by a peace treaty, I will call for the implementation of a strategic rapprochement between NATO and Russia.”\n\nShe also said, if elected president, she would take France out of NATO’s integrated command structure to restore French sovereignty on matters of international security.\n\nPA Media and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/11/02/Macron-Johnson-Glasgow-1200x800.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:58:23'}

There are five principle takeaways from the result:\n\n1. A polarised country\n\nThe post-vote map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country, and Le Pen receiving backing in the northern industrial heartlands and Mediterranean south.\n\nBig city centres, upper middle classes and pensioners backed Macron while lower-income groups were overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\n"The biggest fractures are above all generational and social," said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, saying that dividing the country into an urban pro-Macron camp and a rural pro-Le Pen did not fully correspond to reality.\n\n2. Boycott\n\nTurnout was just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round run-off vote in France since Georges Pompidou defeated Alain Poher in 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who went to voting stations Sunday also took the trouble not to cast a vote for either candidate, with 6.35 percent of the votes blank and 2.25 percent spoilt.\n\nTaken together, these factors mean over a third of registered voters in France did not make a choice in the election.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and spoilt ballots," said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came third in the first round.\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of supporters in the French capital, Marine Le Pen thanks voters outside of Paris and in the countryside, and launches her legislative election campaign, after losing the presidency to Emmanuel Macron pic.twitter.com/KhCVpx6Heq — Sarah Elzas (@toucanradio) April 24, 2022\n\n3. Protests\n\nSporadic protests in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse took place after the results were announced, by ultra-left demonstrators furious at the choice France had in the election.\n\nPolice used tear gas and charged protesters, and while the protests were relatively small, they risk being a harbinger of things to come, especially if radical parties do not receive major representation in June parliamentary elections.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy which has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote on Sunday.\n\nEstimates for voting in the second round at 20:00 © RFI\n\n4. Generational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors to get over the line.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nThe general feeling is one of relief at Macron’s campaign headquarters, with his supporters telling us a potential Le Pen victory had them worried. #presidentielles2022 #FrenchElection pic.twitter.com/9SPSPdrVqY — Amanda Morrow (@amandalmorrow) April 24, 2022\n\n5. Lost territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost three million.\n\nBut his performance was generally poor beyond the mainland, failing to attract voters who had backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nPlaying on anger against Paris and Macron as a leader, Le Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nHe could only claim victory in the islands in the Pacific such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist Sciences Po university in Paris.

57% of the vote.\n\nThe Prime Minister, calling France one of the UK’s “closest and most important allies”, said he was looking forward to working with Mr Macron on bilateral and global issues following his new mandate.\n\nLondon and Paris have endured a tense relationship in recent years, with Mr Macron’s administration outspoken on post-Brexit fishing rights and the Conservative Party administration’s approach to tackling migrants crossing the Channel in small boats.\n\nBut with a second term likely to be confirmed by official results later on Sunday, the UK Government will likely be hoping it paves the way to work more constructively in future.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Mr Johnson said: “Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on your re-election as president of France.\n\n“France is one of our closest and most important allies.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world.”\n\nDavid Lammy, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, congratulated the president for “defeating the far-right to win a historic second term”.\n\nIf the projections hold, centrist Mr Macron would become only the third president since the 1958 founding of modern France to win twice at the ballot box, and the first in 20 years, since incumbent Jacques Chirac trounced Ms Le Pen’s father in 2002.\n\n“This is a victory for democracy and co-operation over nationalism and intolerance,” Mr Lammy added.\n\n“The UK-France relationship is vital for both countries.\n\n“As Putin continues his illegal war in Ukraine, it is more vital than ever that the continent of Europe and our Nato allies remain united in defence of our common security.”\n\nLabour and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer also offered his congratulations to the 44-year-old, adding on Twitter: “The relationship between our countries is based on respect and allyship, and we look forward to that continuing.”\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was “delighted” that her devolved administration could “continue to work in close partnership” with Paris on issues such as “climate change, biodiversity, culture and our common European values”.\n\nMs Le Pen was projected to win between 41.5% and 43% support, an unprecedented result for the far-right and the 53-year-old on her third attempt to win the French presidency.\n\nAnd Mr Farage likened her gain in popularity to UKIP in Britain.\n\nHe added: "Every single election that goes by she gets a bit stronger.\n\n"When you looked at the victory party and the acceptance speech of Macron, there wasn\'t much cheering, there wasn\'t much celebration.\n\nHer problem is her father because there no question her father was anti semitic, very racist.\n\n"In many ways if you voted

Macron\'s party now faces an uphill battle ahead of June parliamentary elections, with rivals on both left and right vowing to take the fight to him. FRANCE 24 takes a look at some of the main takeaways from France\'s presidential vote.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nA nation divided\n\nA post-election map of France shows startling regional disparities, with Macron largely enjoying support in Paris, the west, southwest and centre of the country while Le Pen won backing in the struggling northern industrial heartlands, the Mediterranean south and French overseas territories.\n\nBig city centres, the upper-middle classes and older voters backed Macron while lower-income groups voted overwhelmingly in favour of Le Pen.\n\nBut according to Mathieu Gallard, research director of the Ipsos France polling firm, it would be a mistake to imagine a country divided between an urban pro-Macron camp and rural Le Pen supporters.\n\n"The biggest fractures are, above all, generational and social," said Gallard.\n\nRising abstention\n\nTurnout was at just 72 percent, with abstentions at their highest of any second-round vote in France since 1969.\n\nIn an alarming signal for Macron, 8.6 percent of those who made the effort to turn up at voting stations on Sunday cast a protest vote to send the message that neither candidate was acceptable. Some 6.35 percent of votes were "blank" on Sunday and another 2.25 percent were "null", with a candidate\'s name crossed out or a ballot otherwise invalidated.\n\nMacron "is submerged in an ocean of abstention and nullified ballots", said far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who finished third in the first round just behind Le Pen.\n\nStreet protests and discontent\n\nPolice used tear gas on leftist demonstrators who were furious at the candidates France was forced to choose between after sporadic protests erupted in cities including Paris, Rennes and Toulouse following the release of election results on Sunday.\n\nWhile the protests were relatively small, they could be a harbinger of things to come.\n\n"Here we go for another five years of liberalism led by a Parisian oligarchy that has done a lot of damage to the country," said Joroni Piques, a protester in Toulouse who did not vote.\n\nGenerational divide\n\nFor a man who is just 44, Macron is still struggling to make a major impact among younger voters and remains reliant on large support among seniors.\n\nFigures by Ipsos and data analysis firm Sopra Steria show that while 61 percent of votes from 18- to 24-year-olds went to Macron, 41 percent of people in that age group did not vote at all.\n\nHis victory margin was narrow among those aged 25-34 and 35-49, and Le Pen was even slightly ahead among the 50-59 age group.\n\nIt was only among pensioners that Macron could count on a bedrock of support, with 71 percent of votes from those aged 71 or over going to the president, according to the Ipsos-Sopra Steria report.\n\n"We have an aged France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote," political analyst Jerome Jaffre told LCI television. "It\'s a major sociological gulf."\n\nMacron loses the French territories\n\nMacron is always keen to play up France\'s global reach through overseas territories that are integral parts of the country and have a total population of almost 3 million.\n\nLe Pen came out easily on top in France\'s main Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique as well as in French Guiana in South America and the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte.\n\nMacron could only claim victory in the Pacific islands such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\n\n"The anti-Macron feeling has considerable power," said Martial Foucault, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris.

But let’s not forget the jitters in Macron’s camp ahead of and just after the first round. A week ago, many analysts warned that the result would be within five points, within the margin of error. It was only in the final days of campaigning that Macron’s lead started to open up.\n\nThe disaster may have been avoided, but this doesn’t change the fact that Le Pen has just obtained 41% of the vote, the highest score in the history of the far-right in France.

Photo: VCG\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron for his reelection victory. Xi gave high credit to the development of bilateral relations in the past five years under Macron\'s governance, and stressed that the stable development of ties has grown more prominent amid the increasingly complicated international atmosphere.Observers believe that in his second term, Macron will try to lead France, as well as the EU, to seek more strategic autonomy, and continue to seek cooperation with China, as alienating Russia has put France and the EU in dire need of cooperation with others, especially China.Macron\'s victory is also a relief for the EU and the US, which were concerned that a victory for his far-right competitor would splinter EU unity and send political shockwaves throughout the continent. However, Chinese observers predicted Macron\'s victory will hardly guarantee him or France the power to further solidify the bloc as it faces "divergence on principles" brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The widely watched French election came to a close on Sunday with Macron taking 58.55 percent of the vote, fending off the challenge from his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen. This also made Macron the first French leader to get reelected as president in 20 years.Xi on Monday sent a congratulatory message to Macron. In his message, Xi said that over the past five years, the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has maintained a high level of development under the guidance of the two heads of state.The two sides have continued to deepen practical cooperation in various fields, combated the COVID-19 pandemic shoulder to shoulder, jointly upheld multilateralism and improved global governance, injecting new impetus into the development of China-European Union relations and making new contributions to world peace, stability and prosperity, Xi said.Speaking on Macron\'s victory, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also said that China is willing to work with France, and other EU countries, to deepen the strategic partnership between China and the bloc, to inject much needed stability and positive energy into the turbulent world.Macron\'s victory has eased the anxiety of Western powers, which feared the election of a nationalist, eurosceptic Le Pen would have wreaked havoc on the unity of EU, as well as the West\'s anti-Russia alliance, as Le Pen has been a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.In what Reuters called a "sign of relief," European leaders were quick to congratulate Macron on his victory. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the first foreign leader to call Macron and congratulate him on his reelection, France 24 quoted Scholz\'s office as saying. "Your voters have sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today. I am happy that we will continue our good cooperation," Scholz wrote on Twitter.European Council president Charles Michel and the prime ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg were also among the first group to congratulate Macron, followed by almost all of the bloc\'s 27 leaders.Putin also sent Macron a message of congratulations, Russian news agencies quoted the Kremlin as saying.US President Joe Biden congratulated Macron on his reelection Sunday (US time), calling France a "key partner in addressing global challenges."However, Chinese observers said that the increasing number of voters who cast their ballots for Le Pen, who takes a hostile stance against the EU and NATO, should ring alarm bells for those two blocs, as it signals rising dissatisfaction against them among the general public in France, one of the EU\'s most pivotal countries.According to Bloomberg, Le Pen got around 2.9 million more votes than in 2017, when she also faced Macron in the presidential run-off, while Macron lost about 2 million votes.With former German chancellor Angela Merkel bowing out of political life, the onus falls on Macron to take up the mantle of European leadership and seek a more independent EU, said Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. However, the French president may find the task an extremely difficult one, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict showed that the divergences among EU countries are not only about their interests, but also about their principles.Divergences remain between countries such as Germany and France and among Eastern European countries in their reaction to Russia over the Ukraine crisis. For example, countries such as Germany and France advocate solving the crisis via dialogue and are more reluctant to slap tough sanctions as they may backfire, and Eastern European countries, such as Poland, are all for a tough response against Russia, said experts.Observers also noted that the current crisis will only deepen differences among European countries over strategic autonomy - countries such as France and Germany support the concept while some Eastern European countries disagree amid concerns they may lose defensive support from the US."There\'s little room for Macron, or France, to strengthen the unity of the bloc given the rising problems, unless it finds a new mechanism, because the old way clearly doesn\'t work well," said Cui.\n\nSupporters cheer after the victory of Emmanuel Macron in France\'s presidential election, at the Champ de Mars, in Paris, on April 24, 2022. Photo: AFP\n\nZheng Ruolin, a senior Chinese media professional and European studies expert who has lived in France for several years, expected Macron to roll out a slew of important policies in his second term, such as keeping its distance with the US, continuing to seek cooperation with China and being proactive toward Russia.Zheng told the Global Times that he also believed Macron\'s first visit to Asia will be to China, just as it was when he won the presidential election five years ago.In his congratulatory message to Macron, Xi also emphasized that both China and France are major countries with a tradition of staying independent. Xi said the strategic significance of the sound and stable development of China-France relations has become ever more prominent as the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes.In the latest bilateral exchanges between leaders of the two countries in February, Macron said in a phone conversation that during its rotating presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of this year, France will make all-out efforts to advance the positive agenda between the EU and China, and work together with China to ensure the success of the EU-China Leaders\' Meeting and push forward the development of EU-China relations. France hopes that progress will be made in the ratification and entry into force of the EU-China investment agreement.Song Luzheng, a France-based research fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University, said that Macron is a firm supporter of strategic autonomy and it is not difficult for him to see that what EU currently needs is to reduce its dependence on the US. In this way, France and the whole of EU, when facing the risk of cutting themselves off from Russia, are in even greater need of China.Song is also optimistic that during Macron\'s second term, China-France and China-EU relations will see some breakthroughs.However, the prospects are far from bright. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European politicians have been pressuring China to vocally criticize Russia, despite China\'s repeated call to not add fuel to the fire and to promote dialogue. Other disputes have also cast a shadow over bilateral ties, such as EU\'s criticism of China\'s response to Lithuania after the tiny Baltic country touched on China\'s red-button Taiwan question.Moreover, the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment was stalled by the unilateral freeze undertaken by the European Parliament in May 2021.But despite these challenges, economic and trade ties between the two remain strong and continue to expand. In the first two months of 2022, the EU surpassed ASEAN as China\'s biggest trading partner after losing the spot in 2021, as trade between China and the EU surged 14.8 percent year-on-year to $137.16 billion.The conflicts exist and will be there in the future, but China and EU have established a smooth dialogue mechanism that enables the two to negotiate through those problems, said experts.They noted that the EU needs to realize that at a strategic level, China and the bloc need each other, and for such cooperation to work smoothly, bilateral relations should not be disrupted by issues such as Ukraine, Lithuania and ideological issues.', 'image': 'https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-04-25/26115692-8873-4031-92a5-8fc89f398f54.jpeg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:43'}

But she made clear she still had political ambitions.\n\nLe Pen said on Sunday she would "never abandon" the French and declared that she had scored a "brilliant victory" in her defeat.\n\nFor the upcoming parliamentary elections, her party has not formed an alliance with that of far-right rival Éric Zemmour, who scored 7 percent in the first round of the presidential election.\n\nSenior Le Pen aide Jean-Philippe Tanguy said Monday that Zemmour would have to acknowledge that she was the leader of the opposition.\n\nFrench parties look to win seats in June parliamentary election 01:40\n\nRelief among allies\n\nMacron will now try to implement his vision of more pro-business reforms and tighter EU integration after a first term overshadowed by protests, then the coronavirus pandemic and finally Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMacron\'s re-election sparked relief across Europe, where he has been seen as a guarantor of continuity.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called Macron\'s victory "great news", European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said she was "delighted" and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said French voters had "sent a strong vote of confidence in Europe today".\n\nUS President Joe Biden, Canada\'s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Australian premier Scott Morrison also welcomed his win.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin – whom Macron had unsuccessfully sought to persuade to end the invasion of Ukraine – said Monday he wished the French president "success in your state activities, as well as good health and well-being".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Macron "a true friend of Ukraine".\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/07fd6986-c525-11ec-9a8a-005056bf8594/w:1280/p:16x9/macron-emotion.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:38'}

As one campaign ended, another quickly began.\n\nThe 70-year-old is now seeking to line up an "intergroup" of left-wing allies in the National Assembly that would allow him to force a power-sharing “cohabitation” government with President Emmanuel Macron’s La Republic on the Move (LREM) party.\n\nWith nearly 22 percent of the first round vote, Mélenchon feels he’s in a strong position to build a so-called “New Popular Union” around himself and LFI.\n\nSo what alliances will the far-left kingmaker be able to forge with parties that declined to join forces with him in the presidential polls?\n\nConditions\n\nAs it courts potential allies, LFI – which is certain to build handsomely on its 17 National Assembly lawmakers – has laid out conditions for any future partnerships. Its main policies of lowering the retirement age to 60 years, raising the minimum wage, price freezes and the ushering in of a “Sixth Republic” are not negotiable.\n\nLFI also wants its own candidates to be allowed to run in the number of constituencies that is proportional to its vote share in the presidentials. Then there’s a tricky question of how bound the coalition would be to European treaties.\n\nA handful of those are at odds with Mélenchon’s policy platform, which he says he wants to implement even if it means breaking EU rules.\n\nEuropean MP Yannick Jadot, who came third in the presidentials on the Europe-Ecologie Les Verts (EELV) greens party ticket, wants France to move towards more European integration.\n\nUnnamed EELV sources told BMFTV that Mélenchon’s demands were too great and risked “erasing” the platforms of other leftist parties altogether.\n\nJadot himself told France Inter radio on Tuesday that he was broadly in favour of a left-wing coalition, but not with Mélenchon as its leader.\n\n"We have such a responsibility on the climate," he said – adding the left needed a “very open" coalition that respected "the diversity and identity of its partners”.\n\nEELV’s own internal divisions – notably between Jadot and the party\'s national secretary Julien Bayou – may also prove a stumbling block to any future alliance.\n\nThe latter has conceded that time is running out and “the dice must be thrown this week” on the matter.\n\n.@yjadot : "Je soutiens la perspective d\'une coalition, qui doit être une coalition très ouverte.

Despite the paltry 1.75 percent of the vote managed by presidential hopeful Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists still enjoy a well-established local power base, with 28 lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nA representative of the Communist Party (PCF) told BFMTV that the “disrespectful” number of constituencies offered to them meant the jury was still out on their involvement in a possible coalition.\n\n"There is still too much uncertainty to say whether the Communists will accept this agreement or slam the door," the PCF member said.\n\nElsewhere, LFI is also in talks with the New Anti-Capitalist Party, which has responded favourably and has been openly pushing LFI’s notion that the June polls represent a "third round” of the presidential contest.\n\nAll 577 deputy seats in the lower house will be up for grabs on 12 and 19 June, with LREM likely to meet stiff resistance.

Still, the occasion was not as festive as in 2017 for Macron’s supporters, who face many challenges given the fragmented political landscape that this last electoral exercise has left.\n\nDespite the clear victory, the gap continues to narrow with France’s far-right, which gained support compared to 2017, when Le Pen received 33.9% of the vote.\n\nThis did not prevent many elected officials from all sides from sharing their satisfaction.\n\n“It’s a relief because France has still resisted the worst,” Green MEP David Cormand told EURACTIV. “It’s first and foremost a relief”, agreed EU lawmaker Sylvie Guillaume from the S&D group.\n\nThe Europhiles were also very pleased by the result. “It is reassuring to see a president who takes Europe to heart, as well as the Franco-German couple,” Jérôme Quéré, delegate general of the European Movement – France, told EURACTIV.\n\n“This is excellent news for Europe, which will be able to continue to move forward and break its taboos”, said co-leader of the French, Renew delegation in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer. “Our European friends were counting on us. Tonight we tell them that we will continue to transform Europe by their side”, she added.\n\nWhile Macron received many congratulations from his European counterparts, he acknowledged his victory was not as self-evident as last time.\n\n“Many of our compatriots voted for me, not to support the ideas I put forward, but to block the extreme right”, he told the crowd, thanking them and committing to address these divisions.\n\n“Our challenge is to restore French unity. The nation is only happy when it is united”, Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, told journalists at Macron’s rally.\n\nTurnout was also particularly low, with only about 72% of the French making an effort to cast a ballot.\n\nEURACTIV's French presidential election coverage has kicked off The French head to the polls on Sunday (April 24) to decide, once again, whether Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen will lead the country for the next five years. Follow EURACTIV’s live coverage from Paris.\n\nLe Pen’s peak\n\nNot too far away from the Champ-de-Mars, where Macron’s supporters gathered, Le Pen celebrated her “resounding victory”. “The ideas we represent are reaching a peak”, she told her supporters, stressing that there was a “form of hope”.\n\nThe far-right leader obtained 41.45% of the votes (12 million votes), a score never reached before by the nationalist party. By comparison, Le Pen received the support of 10.6 million voters in 2017, while her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, obtained 5.5 million votes in 2002.\n\n“Between the rounds, we were the victim of a diabolisation campaign that dissuaded Mélenchon voters and abstainers from joining us,” argued Rassemblement national MEP Gilles Lebreton, adding that “the system”, once again, managed to block the way to Le Pen.\n\n“Tonight is not the end of something. It is the beginning of a cycle”, emphasised Edwige Diaz, Le Pen’s spokesperson. All eyes are now on what some call the “third round”: the legislative elections in June. As of tomorrow, the party’s executives will meet to talk about strategy, EURACTIV has learned, the goal is to have “the largest number of MPs or at least a very large group in the Assembly,” as Lebreton told EURACTIV. Taking over the National Assembly could indeed require a set of alliances between the parties. If, for Marine Le Pen, the most natural partner seems to be Eric Zemmour, the game is far from being won. “We call to blow up this barrier that exists between patriots,” MEP Jerome Riviere from Zemmour’s party told EURACTIV while denouncing Marine Le Pen’s rallying strategy of “Everyone behind me.” Asked if he was happy with the Le Pen’s score, whom he used to support, he said that he found “indecent” her comments on her “resounding victory”, considering that it remained a defeat and that it was another “missed opportunity”. ANALYSIS-Win or lose, Le Pen's nationalism is already changing Europe ‘Frexit’ may be off the menu offered by Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday’s crucial presidential run-off against incumbent Emmanuel Macron but the threat of a seismic shift to France’s position in Europe looms large ahead of polling day. Mélenchon is thinking big Another disappointed candidate, this time from the first round, far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has big plans. “Macron is the most badly elected president of the 5th republic”, he said to his supporters in an online address. “I ask the French to elect me Prime Minister” by voting for a majority of candidates backing him in June, Mélenchon stated. While the French cannot strictly speaking “elect” the Prime Minister, a majority of newly elected “Insoumis” deputies could leave no choice to Macron to choose Mélenchon, or someone else from his party, to lead the government. Such a power-sharing in France is known as “cohabitation”. Leftist MEP Leïla Chaibi told EURACTIV that she is “appealing to those who do not feel represented […] to take their revenge” in June. “As in sports competitions, it is never good to make the scoresheet for the final when you are still in the quarter-finals,” replied Macron through the media. “When you confuse agendas, you rarely make good decisions,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, Macron must now work on his new government – he officially has until 13 May to name a new Prime minister. All indications are that Jean Castex will not be reappointed.\n\nFrench presidential election: Where does Europe fit into all this?

His populist adversaries are keen to seize control of parliament and scupper Macron’s second term – but analysts say victory for the president’s supporters is the likeliest outcome, although it could require a deal with France’s traditional conservative party.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe opening salvos in the “third round” were ready to fire upon Macron’s victory. “Tonight we start the great battle for the parliamentary elections,” said nationalist Marine Le Pen. She lost the second round to Macron by 58.5 to 41.5 percent – but reduced his lead by half compared to their previous face-off in 2017, signalling once again the French far right’s slow, steady rise.\n\nKeen to turbocharge this momentum in the June polls, Le Pen wants to frame her Rassemblement National (National Rally or RN) party as the sole outlet for opposition to the re-elected president, requesting support from all voters who want to “come together and join forces against Emmanuel Macron, wherever they may come from”.\n\nExtreme-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon is taking a similar approach – telling supporters soon after Macron won that “the third round begins tonight” and that “another world is still possible if you elect enough MPs” from his Union Populaire outfit.\n\nMélenchon for one has explicitly pitched himself as a candidate for Macron’s prime minister if he can somehow gain a parliamentary majority. This would mark a return to “cohabitation”, the system which kicks in when the president lacks majority support in the National Assembly and so picks a prime minister from the winning party, creating a programme based on compromise between the two.\n\nIn the event of Le Pen’s or Mélenchon’s party depriving Macron of the votes he needs to get legislation through, the president could resort to Article 49.3 – the Fifth Republic’s most controversial constitutional tool, allowing the head of state to bypass MPs to create laws unless the opposition launches a vote of no confidence requiring fresh parliamentary elections. Macron “won’t want” to use this uncomfortable last resort, noted Paul Smith, a professor of French politics at Nottingham University.\n\n‘Follow-on elections’\n\nBut experts say both populists face a colossal uphill struggle to try and win the parliamentary elections (or the législatives, as they are called in French).\n\nFrance has had no cohabitation since 2002, after which a constitutional reform kicked in moving parliamentary elections to the aftermath of presidential votes. Since then, the freshly elected (or re-elected) president’s party has sailed to victory on the coattails of their win.\n\nThus past precedent suggests that the same dynamics that carried Macron to victory in the presidential polls will benefit his party in June, explained Jim Shields, a professor of French politics at Warwick University: The legislatives have “assumed the status of ‘follow-on’ elections favouring the newly elected president; no president since 2000 has failed to convert the momentum of their election into a parliamentary majority in the subsequent legislative elections”.\n\n“The general tendency amongst French voters is to go and vote for the party of the president who’s just won,” Smith put it.\n\nWhereas presidents tend to carry their support into the législatives, recently defeated runners-up and third-placed candidates tend to perform unimpressively. Le Pen won nearly 34 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential vote's second round – before the Front National (National Front, the RN's predecessor) got just eight out of the 577 National Assembly seats in the subsequent polls. This came after she reached a strong third place in the 2012 presidential vote, but the National Front performed poorly in the parliamentary elections soon after.\n\n‘Close to nil’\n\nLe Pen and Mélenchon are hoping this time will be different amid fierce anti-Macron sentiment among parts of the French electorate. For swathes of people on both sides of the political spectrum, he is the very incarnation of the haughty, callous technocrat.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that Macron won both rounds of the presidential election – and the first round showed that, of the three big voting blocs dominating France’s political landscape, Macron’s centre-right is the biggest, followed by the far right.\n\n“As things stand at the moment, and given the way things have gone, I think Macron will get a workable majority, although not a huge one,” Smith said.\n\n“This time, the chances of a majority for Le Pen’s RN, even if allied with [far-right presidential candidate] Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête! party, are vanishingly slim,” Shields said. “The different electoral system of legislative elections, with the high bar for contesting the run-off in each constituency, is a hurdle her party finds it almost without exception impossible to surmount.”\n\nLikewise, Shields continued, Mélenchon’s prospects of securing a majority are “close to nil (with only 17 seats in 2017) – and the higher the abstention (which is again likely to be very high), the more remote those chances become by raising the second-round qualifying bar”.\n\nThe prospects for alliances to augment their voting blocs look slim: RN has spurned the idea of a pact with Zemmour while the left’s beleaguered parties are seen as unlikely to make a deal with the mercurial Mélenchon.\n\nMacron deal with conservatives?\n\nWhereas Le Pen’s and Mélenchon’s parties have faltered in recent years’ parliamentary elections, traditional conservative party Les Républicains (LR) held up best when Macron’s party swept its rivals aside in the 2017 législatives, becoming the biggest opposition party despite losing a lot of seats.\n\nLR finds itself in a paradoxical position after its presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse bombed at the ballot box: a negligible force in the race for the Élysée Palace, but a formidable presence at the local level after topping the polls at the 2021 regional elections. LR is also a paradoxical party on an ideological level: the party of Pécresse – whose attempt to cast Macron as a “pale imitation” of a centre-right leader made her, not him, look like the imitator – but also the party of Éric Ciotti, her biggest rival in the LR primaries, whose politics are far more like Zemmour’s than Macron’s.\n\nThe centrist president shifted to the right in tandem with the centre ground of French politics during his first term – after picking his first prime minister Édouard Philippe and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire from the LR ranks. As well as this ideological affinity, the conservative party would also offer Macron the kind of local machinery his political vehicle La République En Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) lacks.\n\nConsequently, “the most likely scenario is a deal between La République En Marche with its centrist allies and the most Macron-compatible components of Les Républicains,” Shields said.\n\n“LR remains a powerful, well embedded party at grassroots level, as seen from its 112 parliamentary seats even in a context of severe presidential defeat in 2017,” he continued. “Here lie Macron’s best reserves for cooperation in an election where it may be more difficult for LREM to obtain a single-party majority than it was in 2017.”\n\nMacron would have to navigate LR’s internal divide in forming an agreement. “You’ve got quite a lot of politicians in Les Républicains who don’t feel so close to Macron, who rather like the more identitarian stuff,” Smith cautioned. The party is “being torn in different directions; some people within LR think there is still space for them to exist” without joining forces with Macron.\n\nBut in the probable event that a diminished number of LR MPs take National Assembly seats, Smith continued, “they still see themselves as the natural party of government, so they would want to go in with Macron”.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f6cfe2c-b96b-11ec-a342-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/macron%20Le%20pen.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:02'}

But the surge in support for far-right candidates begs the question of how long a creaking “republican front” of anti-Le Pen voters will hold in an increasingly polarised nation.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nOn her third attempt, Le Pen has moved several steps closer to the Élysée Palace, adding almost 3 million votes to her tally from 2017 and surpassing 40 percent of the vote. Not since World War II has the nationalist far right come this close to power in France.\n\n“The ideas we represent have reached new heights,” Le Pen told supporters in a defiant speech, hailing a “shining victory” even as she conceded defeat to the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron. The 53-year-old vowed to “keep up the fight” and lead the battle in parliamentary elections in June.\n\nAfter five turbulent years marked by violent protests and Covid lockdowns, Le Pen had sought to frame the election as a referendum on the incumbent. She urged voters to “choose between Macron and France”. Some did see the contest that way. More people chose to vote against her.\n\nFrench presidential election © France 24\n\nThe far-right leader had hoped the very real detestation of Macron among swaths of French voters would be enough to carry her to victory. Many commentators had made similar conjectures, suggesting a large share of the 22 percent of voters who backed hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round vote might swing behind her purely out of anti-Macronism. Such projections matched the flawed narrative of a country split into two blocs – haves and have-nots, liberals and populists, globalists and localists – in which far left and far right supposedly come full circle to challenge the mainstream. They were wrong.\n\n“There are not just two Frances, there are at least three,” said Brice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling institute, speaking on France Inter radio. “Mélenchon’s France is not soluble in Le Pen’s (…). Its values and aspirations are radically opposed to those of the far right.”\n\nIn the end, the largest share of Mélenchon’s supporters grudgingly voted for Macron, as they did in 2017, while a third abstained or cast blank ballots, according to pollsters. Among those who backed the incumbent, more than 90 percent said they did so to keep the far right at bay.\n\nThe re-elected president acknowledged this with uncharacteristic humility in his victory speech on Sunday. “Many of our compatriots voted for me not out of support for my ideas but to block those of the far right,” he told supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. “I want to thank them and I know that I have a duty towards them in the years to come.”\n\nA large majority of French voters once saw it as a moral obligation to keep the far right at a low score, banding together in a “republican front”. Some have stopped thinking that way, others are simply tired of having to vote against the Le Pens again and again. Sunday’s result showed enough voters are still willing to rally against the far right, though the margin is shrinking.\n\nOutdebated, once again\n\nLe Pen’s party was co-founded by her father 50 years ago on a nationalist, anti-immigrant and distinctly xenophobic platform. Those ideological roots are still enough to mobilise the rump of France’s “republican front” in opposition. But they cannot alone explain the far right’s steady progression since Marine Le Pen took over from her father 11 years ago.\n\nThe scion of the Le Pen dynasty has profoundly transformed her father’s Front National (National Front) party, rebranding it and adopting big-government economic protectionism as its main driver. Not all its supporters vote out of hostility towards immigrants, Islam or the European Union. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels.\n\nThe National Rally leader noticeably softened her speech in the run-up to the election, steering clear of controversy and putting a lid on the vituperations that once defined her party. Without renouncing her anti-immigrant stance, she studiously avoided talk of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory championed by extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour, which even the struggling conservative candidate, Valérie Pécresse, clumsily referenced. She knew, no doubt, that their hardline supporters would rally behind her in the run-off.\n\nMarine Le Pen poses for a selfie during a campaign stop in Courtenay, central France, on March 19, 2022. © Guillaume Souvant, AFP\n\nWhen Zemmour surged in the polls in late 2021, critics suggested Le Pen had gone too far in her efforts to “normalise” the former National Front – turning it from radical to bland. But party officials welcomed the shift in perception, noting that some analysts had stopped labelling the National Rally “far right”, adopting alternative labels such as “national populists”.\n\nAs France’s “phoney” campaign entered the final stretch, its shift towards the concerns of low-income workers played into Le Pen’s hands, vindicating the choice of purchasing power as her main theme. It also validated her decision to shun large rallies in favour of small-scale gathering in towns and villages – both a tactical choice and a consequence of her party’s dire financial straits.\n\nWhile her rivals bickered on TV sets and Macron focused on the international stage, the National Rally leader spent much of her time mingling with crowds in depressed areas, showcasing her ability to connect with ordinary people. She cast herself as the “candidate of concrete solutions”, detailing plans to curb the price of gas, petrol, wheat and other staples.\n\nThe strategy was aimed at drumming up support among what is already a consolidated voting group, said Jérôme Sainte-Marie, head of the Polling Vox institute. “Le Pen’s electorate has become a class-based one, combining blue-collar workers and employees, most of them low-earners from the private sector,” he explained. “Their vote signals both support for Le Pen and her platform, and also a form of social identity.”\n\nThe measured, focused, low-profile campaign was enough to push Le Pen into the second round. But when scrutiny increased ahead of the run-off, cracks quickly emerged. She began to muddy her message, unsure as to how she could lure Mélenchon’s backers without forfeiting Zemmour’s (admittedly, an impossible ask). While Macron took the fight to her working-class heartland, she vanished from the radars, hiding from the public eye to prepare her great revenge in a rematch of their farcical televised debate of 2017.\n\nThe French president took the gloves off in a bruising debate that rattled his far-right challenger. © Francois Mori, AP\n\nLe Pen had spent the past five years trying to erase memories of that fiasco. But her attempt to dispel concerns about her fitness for the job was largely derailed as Macron zeroed in on her ties to Russia and her plans to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public.\n\nThe far-right candidate hoped to land punches on the issues of poverty and spending power but struggled as Macron repeatedly questioned her grasp of economic figures. Crucially, she mostly failed to put the incumbent on the defensive, allowing him to evade scrutiny of his turbulent five years in office.\n\nCompetition good for Le Pen\n\nWhile Le Pen has made huge strides in “de-demonising” her party – or, rather, in trivialising it – the National Rally leader is yet to close the credibility gap that is also keeping her from power. She has carried the far right to unprecedented heights but is still some distance from the Elysée Palace.\n\n“This is the eighth time defeat strikes the Le Pen family name,” Zemmour said on Sunday, adding Jean-Marie Le Pen’s many presidential runs to his daughter’s three. In the coming months or years, the rabble-rousing former pundit is likely to challenge her once more for control of the nationalist far right.\n\nThe challenge is not necessarily bad news for Le Pen. In fact, the competition has proven to be beneficial for the National Rally leader, focusing attention on the far right, further weakening mainstream conservatives, and adding a reservoir of votes for run-off elections. Above all, it has eroded the ostracism her party suffered from for decades, adding potential allies where previously there were none.\n\n>> How Zemmour’s storm in a teacup hijacked French campaign – and helped Le Pen\n\nFar from weakening Le Pen in this campaign, Zemmour’s incendiary attacks on immigrants and Muslims helped trivialise the far right while allowing the National Rally leader to come across as more respectable. While Zemmour ultimately flopped, abandoned by “tactical” voters who rallied behind Le Pen, his candidacy also revealed the extent to which the French far right can count on the indulgence and complicity of a growing segment of the media.\n\nAdding up the first-round votes won by Le Pen, Zemmour and nationalist right-winger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the far right’s combined total soared to an unprecedented 32.5 percent – underscoring a profound shift in the French electorate. The tally gives Le Pen’s camp a formidable springboard for future polls, starting with highly unpredictable parliamentary elections in June.\n\nFar-right Le Pen plots parliament win after loss to Macron 02:46\n\nA more accurate indicator than the presidential run-off, results from the first round on April 10 signalled the emergence of three camps of roughly equal weight: a centre-right bloc gravitating around Macron, a far-right bloc dominated by Le Pen, and a scattered left emboldened by Mélenchon’s radical pitch. How those three blocs will perform in June is anyone’s guess.\n\nIn his victory speech in 2017, Macron had promised to “do everything” in his power to ensure the French “no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes”. Five years later, the far right has added almost 3 million votes to its tally and the mainstream centre-left has been supplanted by Mélenchon’s more radical force.\n\nThat populist, anti-establishment parties should have come closer to power than ever before is hardly a surprise. Having completed his takeover of the political mainstream, Macron has left space only for radical forces to flourish. There can be no democracy without the possibility of an alternative. Right now, the only alternatives thrive outside the mainstream.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e14b8c6-c4a7-11ec-80de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_328W2EH.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:19'}

But here, too, there is a hitch; this hasn’t worked either,” Putin said.\n\nIn his opinion, Russian society “has shown maturity, solidarity,” and supports its armed forces and the efforts “to ensure Russia’s ultimate security and help the people living of Donbass.”\n\nAfter a ‘fiasco’ in the media field, Putin claimed, the West has turned “to terror, to arranging the murder of our journalists.”\n\nHe was referring to Monday’s announcement by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) that it had detained a group of “neo-Nazis” instructed by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) to kill popular Russian TV host and journalist Vladimir Solovyov. Kiev has denied any role in organizing the assassination attempt.\n\n“In this regard, it should be noted of course that we know the names of all the Western handlers, of all members of Western services, primarily the CIA, who are working with Ukrainian security agencies. Apparently, they are giving them such advice,” the Russian leader said.\n\nHe added sarcastically that “This is their attitude towards the rights of journalists, towards the dissemination of information; this is their attitude towards human rights in general.”\n\n“All they care about is their own rights, some cherishing imperial ambitions, others holding on to their colonial past in the old-fashioned way. But this will not work in Russia,” Putin claimed.\n\nWhile the Kremlin has been accusing the West of attempting to divide Russian society, Western countries have been alleging that Moscow suppresses opposition, independent media, and even dissent in general. This kind of criticism has intensified following the launch of the offensive in Ukraine and subsequent measures taken by Moscow to crack down on “fake news” and so-called “foreign agents.”\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.', 'image': 'https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.04/article/6266cb9985f54054ee16cb06.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:33'}

Here’s today’s news.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – FIGHTING\n\nRussia has made small advances after beginning to focus on the full occupation of the Donbas region, but the lack of resources and combat support is making it hard for the Russian troops to occupy the region, the U.K. Defense Ministry has said in an intelligence update. Russia’s Ministry of Defense has proposed that the military handle payments to families of deceased soldiers, suggesting that Russia is trying to hide the extensive war losses from its own population, the update added. Ayumi Fujimoto reports for NBC News.\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine came under Russian fire this morning, delaying train services, Oleksandr Kamyshim chairman of Ukrainian Railways said in a Telegram post. Julian Duplain reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussia has said that it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 96 miles northeast of the border with Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 local time (1800 EST) and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people. Reuters reports.\n\nNine Russian missiles struck infrastructure in Kremenchuk, an industrial city in central Ukraine, yesterday according to a regional leader. “The enemy does not shy away from anything, even on such a holy day,” Dmytro Lunin, an acting governor and head of the Poltava region’s military administration, wrote on Telegram. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussian attacks targeting the towns of Gorske and Zolote in the eastern Luhansk region killed six people on Saturday, the region’s governor, Sergiy Haida has said. Cora Engelbrecht reports for the New York Times.\n\nA series of artillery strikes hit central and east Kharkiv on Saturday, including a large residential area. There were no casualties in the strike on central Kharkiv, officials said. Thomas Gibbons-Neff reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussia is planning a staged referendum in the Ukrainian city of Kherson to justify “its occupation,” according to the U.K.’s Defense Ministry. “The city is key to Russia’s objective of establishing a land bridge to Crimea and dominating southern Ukraine,” the ministry tweeted in an intelligence update. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – MARIUPOL\n\nUkrainian forces are still in full control of the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol and have repelled continuous assaults by Russian infantry, Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Battalion, said yesterday. Ukrainian forces are willing to leave the factory and evacuate the city if given guarantees of safe passage for themselves and hundreds of civilians, Palamar said. Michael Schwirtz reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussian troops may be preparing for a renewed assault on the Azovstal steel plant, according to an update by Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War. BBC News reports.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross issued a statement yesterday saying that it was “deeply alarmed” by the situation in Mariupol. The statement called for unimpeded access to help residents, including hundreds of wounded. Marc Santora and Austin Ramzy report for the New York Times.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – U.S. RESPONSE\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said during an unannounced trip to Kyiv on Sunday that U.S. diplomats would return to Ukraine this week. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to the Ukrainian capital, where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials, making them the highest-level US officials to have traveled to the country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hanlser report for CNN.\n\nBridget Brink, who is currently the ambassador to Slovakia, is expected to be named as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine – a position that has been left vacant since early 2020 under former President Trump’s administration. President Joe Biden will likely nominate her later today. María Paúl and Missy Ryan report for the Washington Post.\n\nAt the meeting in Kyiv, the U.S. pledged more than $700m in military financing to help Ukraine’s war efforts, officials have said. About half of the money will go to Ukraine, while the rest will be split among NATO members and other regional allies. In addition, the US will sell $165m of ammunition to Ukraine. BBC News reports.\n\nRussia is failing in its war aims but Ukraine is succeeding, Blinken said following his and Austin’s meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Reuters reports.\n\nThe United States hopes the war in Ukraine will result in a “weakened” Russia that no longer has the capacity to invade its neighbors, Austin told reporters during his trip to Kyiv. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said. Annabelle Timsit and Julie Yoon report for the Washington Post.\n\nZelenskyy has thanked the US for its “unprecedented” support for Ukraine, following his meeting with Blinken and Austin yesterday. “We appreciate the unprecedented assistance of the United States to Ukraine. I would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, for his personal clear position. To thank all the American people, as well as the Congress for their bicameral and bipartisan support. We see it. We feel it,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukraine’s presidential website reports.\n\nAlina Kabaeva, the woman the U.S. government believes to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend, has been spared sanctions in a last-minute decision. U.S. officials believe that sanctioning Kabaeva would be deemed so personal a blow to Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the U.S.. Vivian Salama, Joe Parkinson and Drew Hinshaw report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMultiple governors have announced that their state National Guards would be sending armored vehicles to Ukraine in response to a request from the Pentagon. Gov. Mike DeWine (R- OH) and Gov. Jim Justice (R – WV) announced that their state National Guards would be providing an unspecified number of M-113 armored personnel carriers, which help move equipment and soldiers “while providing protection from small arms fire and the effects of artillery,” according to press releases from both governors’ offices. Caroline Vakil reports for The Hill.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – GLOBAL RESPONSE\n\nIn recent days Russian authorities have stopped publishing data on government debt, trade statistics and oil production, while lawmakers work on a bill banning lenders from sharing data with foreign states. The growing blackout is part of an effort by the Russian authorities to protect the economy and domestic companies from further sanctions by the West. Limited data means that Washington and Brussels will have less visibility on whether and how their sanctions are working. Georgi Kantchev reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTop Ukrainian officials yesterday expressed disapproval of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of the officer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told NBC in an interview that Guterres is “not really” authorized to speak on behalf of the Ukrainian government. Quint Forget reports for POLITICO.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\n\nRussia has proposed the forced donation of blood by captured Ukrainian soldiers, according to Ukrainian ombudsperson for Human Rights, Lyudmila Denisova. “This fact testifies to the analogy of the atrocities of the Nazis in the concentration camps during the Second World War,” she said in a post on Facebook. Aaron Reich reports for the Jerusalem Post.\n\nGreenpeace activists have sought to block a tanker from delivering Russian oil to Norway, chaining themselves to the vessel in a protest against the war in Ukraine. As of this morning, the Ust Luga product tanker is anchored outside Exxon Mobil’s Slagen oil terminal some 43 miles south of the capital Oslo, according to the vessel tracker Marine Traffic. “Oil is not only at the root of the climate crisis but also of wars and conflicts. I am shocked that Norway operates as a free port for Russian oil, which we know finances Putin’s warfare,” Greenpeace Norway head Frode Pleym said. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine’s postal service has said it was targeted by a cyberattack on Friday following to sale of stamps portraying a Ukrainian soldier making a crude gesture to a Russian warship. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine has asked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a list of equipment that is necessary for the reliable and safe operation of its nuclear facilities during the war. The list specifically mentions radiation measuring instruments, shielding materials, electrical power systems and diesel generators. The IAEA reports.\n\nOTHER U.S. RELATIONS\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said yesterday that the current scale of espionage and cybersecurity threats from China were “unprecedented in history.” He noted that China’s hacking program is larger “than that of every other major nation combined,” adding that China’s targets span nearly every sector of the economy. Monique Balls reports for The Hill.\n\nThe Chinese government is not only mistreating Uyghurs within China’s borders, it is hunting them down abroad with help from countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, according to a new report by the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S.. More than 5,500 Uyghurs outside of China have been targeted by Beijing, hit with cyberattacks and threats to family members who remain in China, and more than 1,500 Uyghurs have been detained or forced to return to China to face imprisonment and torture in police custody, according to the report. Anna Schecter reports for NBC News.\n\nPresident Biden yesterday issued a statement memorializing the Armenian genocide. “Let us redouble our efforts toward healing and building the better, more peaceful world that we wish for our children … A world where human rights are respected, where the evils of bigotry and intolerance do not mark our daily lives, and where people everywhere are free to pursue their lives in dignity and security,” the statement said. David Cohen reports for POLITICO.\n\nOTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nEmmanuel Macron won a second term as president of France yesterday, triumphing over his far-right challenger, Marine Le Pen. Projections at the close of voting, which are generally reliable, showed Macron gaining 58.5 per cent of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5 per cent. His victory was much narrower than in 2017 when the margin was 66.1 per cent to 33.9 per cent for Le Pen. Roger Cohen reports for the New York Times.\n\nPreliminary results for Slovenia’s parliamentary elections show that right-wing Prime Minister Janez Jansa has lost to centrist rivals. With 95 per cent of the vote counted, results indicated that Jansa’s Slovenian Democratic Party had won around 24 per cent of the vote. That is far behind the 34 per cent of its main rival, the centrist Freedom Movement, meaning that Jansa is highly unlikely to keep his post as prime minister. Andrew Higgins reports for the New York Times.\n\nIsrael yesterday closed its civilian border crossing with the Gaza Strip, preventing thousands of Gazans from getting to work in Israel, in an effort to pressure Gaza’s ruler Hamas to halt rocket attacks against southern Israel. The closure comes after Palestinian militants fired two rockets at Israel Friday night and one on Saturday morning. Dov Lieber reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHundreds of Arab militia fighters, attacked a village in Sudan’s western Darfur region yesterday, torching homes and shops and killing at least 150 people, according to aid groups and U.N. officials. The violence, which later spread to a nearby town, was the latest in a series of clashes involving Arab and ethnic African groups in Darfur in recent months. Declan Walsh reports for the New York Times.\n\nBritish man, Luke Symons, who was held captive in Yemen without charge or trial for five years has been released from jail. U.K. foreign secretary, Liz Truss, confirmed yesterday that Symons “would shortly be reunited with his family.” She thanked Omani and Saudi negotiators as well as U.K. Foreign Office staff as he was released alongside 13 other foreign nationals in Yemen. Joe Middleton reports for the Guardian.\n\nThree policemen were killed in central Nigeria’s Kogi state on Saturday after gunmen stormed a police station in an attack claimed by Islamic State. The attack came a day after explosives planted at a bar in northeast Nigeria injured 11 people. Anna MacSwan reports for the Guardian.\n\nHealth authorities in the Democratic Republic and Congo have declared a new outbreak of Ebola, the Work Health organisation reported yesterday. So far, just one case has been confirmed and investigations to determine the source of the outbreak are ongoing. U.N. News Centre reports.\n\nSaudi princes have sold more than $600 million worth of real estate, yachts and artwork in the U.S. and Europe since the kingdom’s de facto ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman tightened the purse strings of the ultrawealthy ruling family. The transactions represent a radical change of fortune for senior princes who funnelled windfalls from oil booms in the 1970s and 1980s into some of the world’s most exclusive markets. “They’ve clearly been cut down to a disciplined, defined regimen and are having to live on that,” said British historian Robert Lacey, who has chronicled the Saudi ruling family since the 1980s. Prince Mohammed is “here for the long term and he’s reshaping things in a long-term fashion.” Stephen Kalin reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nJAN. 6, 2021 ATTACK\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was confronted in court on Friday over past social media posts advocating violence against Democrats. At the hearing in Atlanta, to determine if Greene is constitutionally barred from running for reelection because of her alleged role in the Jan. 6 attack, the congressperson repeatedly said she couldn’t remember past comments or interactions. Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck report for CNN.\n\nOTHER DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS\n\nTwitter Inc. is in discussions to sell itself to Elon Musk and could finalize a deal as soon as this week. The two sides met Sunday to discuss Musk’s proposal and were making progress, according to sources familiar with the matter. However, there is no guarantee they will reach a deal. Cara Lombardo and Dana Cimilluca report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nA U.S. Air Force general officer has been found guilty of abusive sexual contact, in the first-ever court-martial trial and conviction of a general officer in the history of the military branch. Maj. Gen. William T. Cooley was found guilty on one of three specifications of sexual assault connected to a 2018 incident in New Mexico, the Air Force said in a statement. Aaron Pellish reports for CNN.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments today in the case of Joseph Kennedy – a Washington state high school football coach who lost his job after he refused to stop praying on the field immediately after games. “There is good reason to think that its newly expanded conservative majority will not only rule in Kennedy’s favor but also make a major statement about the role religion may play in public life,” Adam Liptak reports for the New York Times.\n\nThis morning a judge will consider whether to hold former President Trump in contempt for violating a court order that he comply with a subpoena regarding a civil investigation into his business practices. New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is asking a state court judge to fine Trump $10,000 for each day that he has failed to turn over documents relevant to the subpoena. Harper Neidig reports for The Hill.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray yesterday highlighted an increase in violence against police officers last year, including a jump in police murders. “Violence against law enforcement in this country is one of the biggest phenomena that I think doesn’t get enough attention,” Wray said in an interview, adding that in 2021, “officers were being killed at a rate of almost one every five days.” Monique Beals reports for The Hill.\n\nA Colorado man who set himself on fire in front of the Supreme Court on Friday in an apparent Earth Day protest against climate change has died. The Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C., said that Wynn Bruce, 50, of Boulder, Colo., died on Saturday from his injuries after being airlifted to a hospital following the incident. Chris Cameron reports for the New York Times.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 has infected over 80.98 million people and has now killed over 991.254 people in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Globally, there have been over 507.56 million confirmed coronavirus cases and over 6.21 million deaths.

"Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness."\n\nThe ministry added that, so far, Russia has only made "minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas."\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," the ministry said.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was scheduled to travel to Turkey on Monday and then Moscow and Kyiv. Zelenskyy said it was a mistake for Guterres to visit Russia before Ukraine.\n\n"Why? To hand over signals from Russia? What should we look for?" Zelenskyy said Saturday. "There are no corpses scattered on the Kutuzovsky Prospect," he said, referring to one of Moscow\'s main avenues.\n\nIn a boost in support for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to dilute France\'s ties with the European Union and NATO. Le Pen had also spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.\n\nMacron\'s victory was hailed by France\'s allies in the EU as a reassuring sign of stability and continued support for Ukraine. France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons systems to Ukraine.\n\n"We have a lot to do and the war in Ukraine reminds us that we are going through tragic times where France must make its voice heard," Macron told a cheering crowd in his victory speech.\n\nZelenskyy\'s meeting with U.S. officials, his first face-to-face talks with a top American official since a Feb. 19 meeting in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris, took place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter. Speaking from Kyiv\'s ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted its significance to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\n\n"The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!" he said.\n\nTo Ukraine\'s north on the Russian side of the border, a fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot, but no immediate cause was given for the blaze in oil storage tanks.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires showed something burning at coordinates that corresponded to a Rosneft facility some 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Moscow previously has blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nSince failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians have aimed to gain full control over the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war.\n\nFor the Donbas offensive, Russia has reassembled troops who fought around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine. The British Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week and "inflicted significant cost on Russian forces."\n\nIn the south of the Donbas, in the strategic port city of Mariupol, a small pocket of Ukrainian troops continues to hold out against Russian forces in the Azovstal steel factory, a sprawling facility on the waterfront.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the building.\n\nNew satellite images by Planet Labs PBC, taken Sunday, show destroyed buildings across the steelworks and smoke rising from one part of the facility. Roofs have gaping holes; a soccer field is cratered from incoming fire.\n\nMore than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate more than 20,000 civilians have been killed. Recent satellite images showed what appeared to be mass graves to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nChildren in an underground bunker were seen receiving Easter presents in a video released Sunday by the far-right Azov Battalion, which is among the Ukrainian forces at the steel plant in Mariupol.

In addition, Blinken and Austin have announced the provision of more than $700 million in additional direct and indirect military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAt the heart of their talks with President, Volodymyr Zelensky was Kyiv\'s demand for heavier weapons to stop the Russian offensive in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe $713 million aid will be distributed between Ukraine and 15 other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. About $322 million is for Kyiv. The rest are allies who have sent aid to Ukraine since the start of the war to get the weapons they need.\n\nThe total amount of military supplies from the United States to Ukraine reached 3.7 billion dollars.\n\n"We do not know how the war will develop from now on, but we know that the existence of a sovereign, independent Ukraine will last much longer than the presence of Vladimir Putin. We will continue to support Ukraine until final success is achieved," said Antony Blinken at a press conference after the visit, adding that it is an expression of American support for the leadership of Ukraine. He added that he had talked with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will visit Moscow and Kyiv this week, to convey a strong message to President Putin to end the war, a truce to be achieved and the evacuation of civilians from dangerous areas to finally occur.\n\nMoscow, for its part, has sent a note to Washington calling for an end to US arms supplies to Ukraine, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said.\n\n"Have we served a note - yes, we have emphasized that it is an unacceptable situation in which the United States is filling Ukraine with weapons," he said, adding that Russia had called for an end to the practice.\n\nBlinken and Austin are the first US government officials to visit Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The war, which entered its third month, killed thousands and killed 5,500 refugees. Kyiv is also seeking help for Ukrainians stranded in the ruined city of Mariupol. According to the mayor, more than 100,000 people are still there and cannot be evacuated. Ukraine\'s defense in Mariupol is on the verge of collapse, admitted Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to President Zelensky. He also said that high-ranking US officials would not have come to Kyiv if "they were not ready to give up weapons".\n\nEarlier, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said that Russian troops not only did not respond to calls for a ceasefire but also prevented the population from leaving Mariupol and seeking refuge in the interior of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the ceasefire, Kyiv insists on safe and several-day humanitarian corridors for civilians who want to leave Mariupol and go to Kyiv-controlled territories. Authorities in Kyiv will also demand the release or exchange of their fighters, who are still trapped at the Azovstal plant.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Zelensky spoke with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to mediate a truce in Mariupol. Turkey views "in principle positively" the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine after the end of the war with Russia. This was stated in a statement issued by the presidential institution in Ankara after Erdogan\'s telephone conversation with Zelensky. Ukraine is pushing for collective security guarantees in exchange for its refusal to join NATO, pushed by Russian demands.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his re-election and said the French president was a "true friend of Ukraine".\n\n"Congratulations to the president and true friend Emmanuel Macron on his election victory," Zelensky wrote on his Twitter account earlier this morning.\n\nMacron is seeking a diplomatic solution to halt the Russian invasion of Ukraine. France has sent significant quantities of weapons to Ukraine and plans more deliveries.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/BNR', 'image': 'https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-04/photo_verybig_214855.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:03'}

Click here for updates from April 24.\n\nMariupol Officials Say New Mass Grave Found\n\nOfficials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new mass grave has been identified north of the city.\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) north of Mariupol.\n\nSatellite photos released over the past several days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nMariupol has been decimated by fierce fighting over the past two months. The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n___\n\n4 Die, 9 Wounded From Russian Shelling of Kharkiv: Governor\n\nFour people died and nine were wounded as a result of Russia‘s shelling in the Kharkiv region on Monday, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine‘s public broadcaster.\n\n___\n\nKyiv Wants UN to Seek Mariupol Evacuation\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister on Monday urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press in an interview he was concerned that by visiting Moscow on Tuesday before traveling to Kyiv, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap” in the war.\n\nKuleba said Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the seaside city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.\n\n___\n\nRussian Officer: Missile to Carry Several Hypersonic Weapons\n\nA new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic weapons, a senior Russian military officer said Sunday.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the commander of the Russian military’s Strategic Missile Forces, said in televised remarks that the new Sarmat ICBM is designed to carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the Sarmat was test-fired for the first time Wednesday from the Plesetsk launch facility in northern Russia and its practice warheads have successfully reached mock targets on the Kura firing range on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\n___\n\nBridget Brink Named as US Ambassador to Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Monday his nomination of Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nBrink, a career foreign service officer, has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia, and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe announcement comes as American diplomats prepare to return to Ukraine this coming week, although the U.S. embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for now.\n\n___\n\nUS Wants to See Russian Military ‘Weakened’\n\nThe United States wants to see the Russian military “weakened” amid the invasion of Ukraine, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday as he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials in Europe.\n\n“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters, according to a transcript.\n\nHis remarks on Monday are perhaps the most explicit yet from a White House official on the Biden administration’s goals in the conflict, representing a sharpening of rhetoric toward the Russian government as the conflict enters its third month. Austin made the comments while speaking with Blinken at a press conference in Poland, a day after the pair visited Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on providing more military assistance.\n\nWhen asked about the United States’ “goals for success” amid the conflict, Austin responded, “Ukraine remains a sovereign country, a democratic country, able to protect its sovereign territory.” But then he told reporters that he wants to see Russia’s military capacity diminished.\n\n“It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability,” Austin added.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUS Promises More Ukraine Aid\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday after a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is committed to winning his country’s fight against Russia and that the United States will help him achieve that goal.\n\n“He has the mindset that they want to win, and we have the mindset that we want to help them win,” Austin told reporters in Poland, the day after the three-hour face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in Ukraine.\n\nAustin said that the nature of the fight in Ukraine had changed now that Russia has pulled away from the wooded northern regions to focus on the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbass. Because the nature of the fight has evolved, so have Ukraine’s military needs, and Zelenskyy is now focused on more tanks, artillery, and other munitions.\n\n“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can … to ensure that gets to them.”\n\n____\n\nUkraine Removes Hirohito From Video After Japan Protests\n\nUkraine’s government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime monarch Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday.\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.”\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided.\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of Hirohito’s image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government said on Twitter Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”\n\n_____\n\nNumber of Expelled Russian Diplomats Revealed\n\nAround 400 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 28 countries since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry revealed on Monday.\n\nAccording to Deputy Foreign Minister Evgeny Ivanov, diplomatic expulsions became the preferred method of the West even before Feb. 24. Calling the seizure of Russian assets abroad another “unfriendly” measure, he said these actions “will not go unanswered.”\n\n“We counteract where we can, up to appealing to the courts. Unfriendly actions do not go unanswered in the legislative sphere either,” Ivanov said during a parliamentary meeting, as cited by Russian media.\n\nMoscow has previously warned that it would retaliate to all expulsions of its diplomats. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to express “strong protest” over Berlin’s earlier decision to expel 40 employees of Russian diplomatic institutions. As a “symmetrical response,” 40 employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia have been designated persona non grata, the ministry announced.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Says US and Its Allies of Trying to ‘Split Russian Society’\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with top officials at the Prosecutor General’s office, Putin said Russia has come under “unprecedented Western sanctions” amid its military action in Ukraine.\n\nHe charged that the United States and its allies have sought to “split the Russian society and to destroy Russia from within,” adding that their plans have failed.\n\nPutin urged Russian prosecutors to act more quickly to block unsanctioned demonstrations organized from abroad. He also noted that they should focus on exposing “open provocations” against the Russian military allegedly involving international media and social platforms.\n\n_____\n\nNATO Warships Arrive at Finnish Port for Training Exercises\n\nThree NATO warships arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku on Monday to train with Finland’s navy as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the U.S.–led alliance amid increased tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nLatvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, the Finnish defense forces said in a statement.\n\nThe two-day exercise, set to commence on April 28, will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in NATO response forces in 2022 and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework,” the statement said.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on April 13 that her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to apply to join NATO.\n\n_____\n\nPutin Outlines Position on Foreign Firms\n\nRussia faces unprecedented sanctions pressure that continues to intensify, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, noting that despite the prevailing conditions, the country’s economy has the opportunity to function stably and smoothly. He has promised to support businesses as much as possible, including foreign firms that have stayed in Russia.\n\nTo do that, it is necessary to respect the rights of business owners and support them to the full, including by reducing the administrative burden, Putin said. Foreign companies that have remained in Russia despite sanctions pressure should be allowed to “work peacefully,” he added.\n\nThe Russian president earlier instructed the government to allocate additional resources to support small and medium-sized businesses and create better growth conditions for new industries based on new and yet-to-be-developed supply chains. Putin also said he believes that sanctions will result in new leaders emerging in the Russian market.\n\n____\n\nRussia Investigates Large Oil Depot Fire in Region Near Ukraine\n\nRussia said on Monday it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the border with Ukraine.\n\nUnverified social media footage showed what sounded like two explosions followed by a tower of flames, with one unverified video showing a fire raging around a giant fuel reservoir.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said nobody had been hurt in the incident.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 Moscow time (2300 GMT), and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people.\n\nThe Russian Energy Ministry said there was no threat to diesel and gasoline supplies in the Bryansk region after the incident and there were enough fuel stockpiles.\n\nIt added that the scale of the blaze was being assessed.\n\nOther unverified footage showed what looked like another fire burning at a second location in Bryansk.\n\n______\n\nRussia Expels 40 German Diplomats\n\nRussia is expelling 40 German diplomats in response to Germany expelling the same number of Russian diplomats earlier this month.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that it had summoned German ambassador Géza Andreas von Geyr for a “strong protest at the clearly unfriendly decision” to expel the Russian diplomatic staff.\n\nThe ministry said von Geyr was told that 40 members of staff at German diplomatic missions in Russia would be officially declared unwelcome in Russia.\n\n_____\n\nEU Official Says No ‘Unified Position’ Reached on Russian Energy Embargo\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that insufficient support from EU member states means a complete embargo or punitive tariff on Russian oil and gas imports cannot yet be levied.\n\n“At the moment, we in the EU do not have a unified position on this question,” Borrell was quoted as saying by the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday, adding that “a final proposal for an embargo on oil and gas is not yet on the table.”\n\nBorrell’s comment comes as some EU countries, including Poland and Lithuania, are pushing for a sixth round of sanctions against Russian oil imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n____\n\n17 Dead in Russian Military Research Facility Fire on April 21\n\nAt least 17 people have died in last week’s fire at a Russian military research facility, authorities said Monday.\n\nThe regional government in Tver, a city about 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Moscow, said that so far only five of the victims had been identified.\n\nThe blaze at the Central Research Institute for Air and Space Defense of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver erupted Thursday and it took authorities a day to put it out.\n\nOfficials previously said 27 people were injured and 13 of them were hospitalized.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nThe research institute was involved in the development of some of the state-of-the-art Russian weapons systems, reportedly including the Iskander missile.\n\n______\n\n5 Killed by Air Strikes in Central Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities say at least five people have been killed by Russian strikes on the central Vynnytsia region.\n\nThe Vynnytsia regional prosecutors said another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s Russian missile strikes on the towns of Zhmerynka and Koziatyn.\n\nVinnytsia regional Governor Serhiy Borzov said earlier that the Russian missiles targeted “critical infrastructure,” but didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe Vynnytsia region is fully controlled by Ukraine and is far behind the front lines.\n\n____\n\nRussia Opens Humanitarian Corridor for Civilians From Mariupol’s Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian and Donbass forces will observe a ceasefire around the besieged Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday, allowing civilians to evacuate to safety, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defense Management Center, said that armed units will “withdraw to a safe distance and maintain the exit of civilians from the said area in any direction they choose.”\n\n_____\n\nZelenskyy: US Talks Effective, Encouraging\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as “encouraging” and “effective.”\n\nSpeaking in Monday’s video address, he said the United States is offering “powerful” support to his country. Zelenskyy added that they agreed “on further steps to strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army.” He noted that ramping up sanctions against Moscow also was on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nBlinken and Austin said the United States had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition for Ukraine’s war effort, along with more than $300 million in foreign military financing.\n\nZelenskyy noted that Ukraine would expect the United States to lead other allies in offering a set of security guarantees in the future.\n\n_____\n\nRussia: Oil Depot Fire Won’t Cause Shortages\n\nRussia’s Energy Ministry says a massive fire at an oil depot in western Russia will not cause fuel shortages.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that Monday’s fire inflicted damage to a depot containing diesel fuel in Bryansk, and authorities are dealing with the consequences of the blaze.\n\nThe ministry said fuel supplies to consumers haven’t been interrupted and noted that the region has enough diesel fuel for 15 days.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said earlier that a huge blaze erupted overnight at the depot owned by Transneft-Druzhba, a subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled company Transneft, which operates the western-bound Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline carrying crude to Europe. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the blaze, and whether it could affect deliveries to Europe.\n\n_____\n\nRussian Gas Embargo ‘Impossible’ for Austria: Energy Minister\n\nBanning Russian natural gas imports is “currently impossible” for Austria, the country’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, told the press over the weekend.\n\n“Austria is 80 percent dependent on Russian gas. As painful as it is, a gas embargo is currently not possible for us, just as it is for some other countries. The essence of sanctions is to let us last longer than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and we cannot do that without gas,” the official told Die Presse am Sonntag.\n\n____\n\nUkraine Angry at Austrian Comments\n\nKyiv is “disappointed” by the “short-sighted” statements of Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg who suggested that full EU membership might not be the best option for Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Schallenberg, while admitting that deepening ties with Ukraine is necessary as the EU is exporting the “Western way of life,” said that models other than full EU membership should be considered for Ukraine. He mentioned joining the European Economic Area or an association agreement as among the options.\n\nReacting to these comments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko released a strong-worded statement on Sunday.\n\n“We are disappointed by the remarks of the Austrian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs about the European future of Ukraine. We consider them to be strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe,” Nikolenko said, adding that Schallenberg ignores the positive view of “the vast majority” of the populations of the EU’s founding members toward Ukrainian membership.\n\n______\n\nRussia and Ukraine Differ on Odessa Missile Strike\n\nRussian forces have destroyed a logistics terminal in Odessa that held a large batch of foreign weapons, Moscow announced on Saturday amid its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine. However, the city’s authorities have claimed that its air defense group destroyed two missiles but that another four hit a military target and residential buildings, leading to civilian deaths.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the buildings were struck by the Russian attack or attempts by Ukrainian forces to strike down the missiles initially aimed at the military target.\n\nAccording to Russian military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov, in the afternoon, “high-precision long-range air-launched missiles” hit a logistics terminal located on a military airfield near Odessa, where “a large batch of foreign weapons received from the United States and European countries was stored.”\n\n_____\n\nSkating Chiefs Further Isolate Russia\n\nRussia has been stripped of its right to host a figure skating Grand Prix in the 2022–23 season, the International Skating Union (ISU) has confirmed, while further steps could be taken to sanction Russia and Belarus in the international arena.\n\nThe ISU confirmed on Monday that the traditional Russian stage of its Grand Prix series would not take place next season.\n\nThe event, known as the Rostelecom Cup, took place in Sochi last year but has also been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n“Until further notice no International Competitions shall be held in Russia and Belarus. Consequently, the Rostelecom Cup 2022 in Figure Skating will not be included in the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series of the season 2022/23,” read an ISU statement.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Warns US Against Sending More Arms to Ukraine\n\nRussia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.\n\n“We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.\n\nAntonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. He said such arms supplies from the United States would further aggravate the situation and raise the stakes of the conflict.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat and its defense secretary met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\nEarlier in April, President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.\n\n_____\n\nRussia Strikes Ukrainian Oil Depot and Military Installations\n\nRussia struck Ukraine’s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbor, the Russian defense ministry reported on Monday.\n\n“The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said.\n\nRussia said it struck Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River that the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n“High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,” the ministry said.\n\n_____\n\nUS Says Diplomats to Return to Kyiv, as ‘Russia Has Already Failed’ in War Aims\n\nThe United States promised on Monday to reopen its embassy in Kyiv soon, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital and hailed its success so far against Russia’s invasion.\n\nBoth men said the fact they were able to come to Kyiv was proof of Ukraine’s tenacity in forcing Moscow to abandon an assault on the capital last month, and promised more aid to fend off Russian troops now attempting an advance in the east.\n\nU.S. officials said they pledged new assistance worth $713 million for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and other countries in the region.\n\n“In terms of Russia’s war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded,” Blinken claimed in a briefing in Poland after the two officials returned.\n\nRussia has always denied intending to overthrow Ukraine’s government. Western countries say that was its aim from the outset but it failed in the face of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe relative calm in Kyiv is a contrast with the south and east of the country.\n\nSome 200 miles southeast of Kyiv, Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, the governor of the Poltava region said. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there.\n\n_____\n\nUK Claims Russia Made Minor Advances in Ukraine After Its Shift to Donbass\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbass, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence claimed.\n\n_____\n\n5 Railway Stations Come Under Fire in Ukraine, Casualties Reported: State Rail Company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n_____\n\nFire Erupts at Russian Oil Depot Near Border With Ukraine\n\nA fire has erupted at a Russian oil depot near the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Tass news agency reported the fire early Monday in Bryansk.

Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.\n\nBefore the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees.\n\n“You can’t come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,” he said.\n\n___\n\nUkraine to Call for Heavy Arms When Top US Officials Visit Kyiv\n\nUkraine will ask U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for more powerful weapons during an expected visit by the officials to Kyiv on Sunday, seeking to build the country’s defenses against the Russian invasion.\n\nThe trip by Blinken and Austin, announced earlier by Zelenskyy, would be the highest-level visit to Ukraine by U.S. officials since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of the country two months ago.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any visit by Blinken and Austin. The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nNATO and Russian Military Presence in Mediterranean Sea at ‘Cold War’ Levels\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine enters its third month, NATO and Russia have built up their naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea to the most significant levels in decades.\n\nThat was confirmed in a recent interview with Thibault Lavernhe, regional communication officer of French forces in the Mediterranean, who said that “Ukraine has changed things.”\n\n“The Americans are back. This hasn’t been the case since the Cold War,” he said. “Russia has doubled, if not tripled, its military capacity in the area” in terms of destroyers, submarines, and frigates, Lavernhe continued to say.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n___\n\nUkraine’s Military Says Russian Forces Are Trying to Storm Azovstal Plant\n\nRussian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing “offensive operations” in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting airstrikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nSerhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments.\n\n“We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant.\n\nKonstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognized as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet Tass on Sunday.\n\nThe Epoch Times could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian accounts.\n\nKatabella Roberts, Jack Phillips, The Associated Press, and Reuters contributed to this report.', 'image': 'https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/04/22/MG-1-1200x675.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:40'}

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war. Since the beginning of April, just under 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, after some 3.4 million left in March.\n\nThe UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an additional 218,000 citizens of third countries—largely students and migrant workers—have also fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began.\n\nWomen and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.\n\nBeyond the refugees, the IOM estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Ukrainian children have had to flee their homes, including those who remain in the country.\n\n2:45pm: Visit by top US officials sign of improved security situation in Kyiv\n\nA visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday is a strong sign that the security situation in Ukraine\'s capital has improved.

The next day, EU leaders gathered for an extraordinary summit. At that time, they thought the war would only last a few days…\n\nThis seems like ancient history now.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to EU leaders at that summit via video link. Shortly after, the author of this Brief met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who said leaders reeled in shock because Zelenskyy’s video call seemed like a final goodbye.\n\n“One shudders because this man who is asking for help and support may not be alive in the next 48 hours”, Petkov said.\n\nSince then, it has become apparent that the Russian army was not as efficient as we thought, and Ukrainian resistance is not only heroic but potent.\n\nArms started to arrive in Ukraine, Kyiv became safe enough to receive visits from foreign officials, and Zelenskyy addressed parliaments across the world.\n\nRussia re-hashed its strategy, abandoning plans for total dominance via a puppet government and concentrating on territories in the east and south of Ukraine that it still hopes to capture and retain.\n\nChances for a ceasefire are linked with a scenario in which one of the two sides is close to capitulation. But as long as both sides harbour other ambitions – Ukraine to regain most of its territory and Russia to obtain full access to the Black Sea – it is unrealistic to imagine a peace agreement.\n\nBesides, the West now looks set to offer Ukraine whatever weapons it needs, while Russia has no other option but to fight because a defeat is simply not an option for President Vladimir Putin. The main risk factor remains that Putin might be tempted to use arms of mass destruction at some point.\n\nBut if this war remains conventional, as we hope, it is safe to assume that it may last a very long time. And if this is the case, we must concede the war will transform Europe and possibly the world.\n\nThe EU was blind to internal developments in Russia during the run-up to the war, which sought to restore “the glory” of the USSR by force.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU remains over-dependent on Russian oil and gas and vulnerable to Russian propaganda and policy of sowing divisions.\n\nIn hindsight, we can say that the most naïve country was Germany, perceived until recently as our Union’s leader. Conversely, perhaps the most alert country was Poland, who has been fighting a rule-of-law war with the European Commission – a dispute that looks rather unhelpful in the current context.\n\nWhen Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in 2019 that she had ambitions to lead a ‘geopolitical Commission’, she could not know that she would have no other choice three years on. EU policies are changing, taboos are disappearing, and bureaucrats are being pushed out of their comfort zone.\n\nIf, for example, the EU cannot reach an agreement on sanctioning the oil imports from Russia, it should abandon the unanimity rule, which serves nobody else but Putin.

Biden and other NATO heads of state were quick to congratulate the French leader on Twitter, as many feared the implications of nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen defeating Macron. As it turned out, the incumbent beat his Eurosceptic rival handily, by a margin of 58.5% to 41.5%.\n\n“Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his re-election,” Biden tweeted on Sunday. “France is our oldest ally and a key partner in addressing global challenges.

I look forward to our continued close cooperation — including on supporting Ukraine, defending democracy, and countering climate change. — President Biden (@POTUS) April 24, 2022\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin also congratulated Macron, sending a telegram saying, “I sincerely wish you every success in state affairs, as well as good health and wellbeing.”\n\nBiden and Macron finally connected by phone on Monday. The two leaders haven’t seen completely eye-to-eye on responding to Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine. Macron has called for dialogue with Moscow to help bring peace, and he has chosen not to follow his US counterpart and other NATO leaders in branding Putin a “war criminal” and accusing Russian forces of committing “genocide.” In fact, he suggested earlier this month that such rhetoric isn’t conducive to ending the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“Genocide has a meaning,” Macron said. “The Ukrainian people and Russian people are brotherly people. It’s madness what’s happening today. It’s unbelievable brutality and a return to war in Europe. But at the same time, I look at the facts, and I want to continue to try the utmost to be able to stop the war and restore peace. I’m not sure if the escalation of words serves our cause.”\n\nLate last month, after Biden called Putin a “butcher” and said he “cannot remain in power,” Macron countered that leaders must use restraint in speaking about the crisis. “We want to stop the war that Russia has launched in Ukraine without escalation – that’s the objective,” Macron said. “If this is what we want to do, we should not escalate things – neither with words nor actions.”\n\nThe two leaders also clashed last year, such as when Macron admonished Biden for “abandoning” pro-Western allies in Afghanistan and argued that the countries had a “moral responsibility” toward the Afghan people – remarks that were scrubbed from a White House summary of the conversation. Macron’s administration last September recalled its ambassador to Washington and accused Biden of behaving like Trump after Washington partnered with the UK to persuade Australia to scrap a submarine deal with France and instead buy their vessels.\n\nWhite House calls to foreign leaders are typically arranged by staffers to avoid unscripted moments or gaffes. In March, leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reportedly declined to take calls from Biden, who was expected to urge them to ramp up oil production amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.', 'image': 'https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.04/article/6266f1f385f54062be603df2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:27'}

The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:51'}

Such networks allow small units to move undetected by aerial sensors and emerge in unexpected locations to launch surprise attacks and then essentially disappear. For an invader who does not possess a thorough map of the subterranean passages, this can present a nightmare scenario, leading to massive personnel losses, plummeting morale and an inability to finish the conquest of their urban objective – all factors that may have factored in Putin’s decision not to send troops underground in Mariupol.\n\nA history of military tunneling from ancient roots\n\nThe use of tunnels and underground chambers in times of conflict is nothing new.\n\nThe use of tunnels has been a common aspect of warfare for millennia. Ancient besieging forces used tunneling operations as a means to weaken otherwise well-fortified positions. This typically required engineers to construct long passages under walls or other obstacles. Collapsing the tunnel weakened the fortification. If well-timed, an assault conducted in the immediate aftermath of the breach might lead to a successful storming of the defended position.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of this technique is depicted on Assyrian carvings that are thousands of years old. While some attackers climb ladders to storm the walls of an Egyptian city, others can be seen digging at the foundations of the walls.\n\nRoman armies relied heavily upon sophisticated engineering techniques such as putting arches into the tunnels they built during sieges. Roman defenders also perfected the art of digging counter-tunnels to intercept those used by attackers before they presented a threat. Upon penetrating an enemy tunnel, they flooded it with caustic smoke to drive out the enemy or launched a surprise attack upon unsuspecting miners.\n\nThe success of tunneling under fortifications led European engineers in the Middle Ages to design ways to thwart the tactic. They built castles on bedrock foundations, making any attempt to dig beneath them much slower, and surrounded walls with moats so that tunnels would need to be far deeper.\n\nAlthough tunneling remained an important aspect of sieges through the 13th century, it was eventually replaced by the introduction of gunpowder artillery – which proved a more effective way to breach fortifications.\n\nHowever, by the mid-19th century, advances in mining and tunnel construction led to a resurgence in subterranean approaches to warfare.\n\nDuring the Crimean War in the 1850s, British and French attackers attempted to tunnel under Russian fortifications at the Battle of Sevastopol. Ten years later, Ulysses S. Grant authorized an attempt to tunnel under Confederate defenses at the siege of Petersburg, Virginia. In both cases, large caches of gunpowder were placed in chambers created by tunneling under key positions and detonated in coordination with an infantry assault.\n\nTunneling in the age of airpower\n\nWith warfare increasingly relying on aircraft in the 20th century, military strategists again turned to tunnels – undetectable from the skies and protected from falling bombs.\n\nIn World War I, tunneling was attempted as a means to launch surprise attacks on the Western Front, potentially bypassing the other side’s system of trenches and remaining undetected by aerial observers. In particular, the Ypres salient in war-ravaged Belgium was the site of hundreds of tunnels dug by British and German miners, and the horrifying stories of combat under the earth provide one of the most terrifying vignettes of that awful war.\n\nDuring World War II, Japanese troops in occupied areas in the Pacific constructed extensive tunnel networks to make their forces virtually immune to aerial attack and naval bombardment from Allied forces. During amphibious assaults in places such as the Philippines and Iwo Jima, American and Allied forces had to contend with a warren of Japanese tunnel networks. Eventually they resorted to using high explosives to collapse tunnel entrances, trapping thousands of Japanese troops inside.\n\nThe Viet Cong tunnel networks, particularly in the vicinity of Saigon, were an essential part of their guerrilla strategy and remain a popular tourist stop today. Some of the tunnels were large enough to house hospital and barracks facilities and strong enough to withstand anything short of nuclear bombardment.\n\nThe tunnels not only protected Vietnamese fighters from overwhelming American airpower, they also facilitated hit-and-run style attacks. Specialized “tunnel rats,” American soldiers who ventured into the tunnels armed only with a knife and pistol, became adept at navigating the tunnel networks. But they could not be trained in sufficient numbers to negate the value of the tunnel systems.\n\nTunnels for terrorism\n\nIn the 21st century, tunnels have been used to facilitate the activities of terror organizations. During the American-led invasion of Afghanistan, military operatives soon discovered that al-Qaida had fortified a series of tunnel networks connecting naturally occurring caves in the Tora Bora region.\n\nNot only did they hide the movement of troops and supplies, they proved impervious to virtually every weapon in the U.S.-led coalition’s arsenal. The complexes included air filtration systems to prevent chemical contamination, as well as massive storerooms and sophisticated communications gear allowing al-Qaida leadership to maintain control over their followers.\n\nAnd tunneling activity in and around Gaza continues to provide a tool for Hamas to get fighters into Israeli territory, while at the same time allowing Palestinians to circumvent Israel’s blockade of Gaza’s borders.\n\nSoviet tunnels and Ukraine\n\nMany of the tunnels being utilized today in Ukrainian efforts to defend the country were built in the Cold War-era, when the United States routinely engaged in overflights of Soviet territory.\n\nTo counteract the significant air and satellite advantage held by the United States and NATO, the Soviet military dug underground passages under major population centers.\n\nThese subterranean systems offered a certain amount of shelter for the civilian population in the event of a nuclear attack and allowed for the movement of military forces unobserved by the ever-present eyes in the sky.\n\n[Over 150,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.]\n\nThese same tunnels serve to connect much of the industrial infrastructure in Mariupol today – and have become a major asset for the outnumbered Ukrainian forces.\n\nOther Ukrainian cities have similar systems, some dating back centuries. For example, Odesa, another key Black Sea port, has a catacomb network stretching over 2,500 kilometers. It began as part of a limestone mining effort – and to date, there is no documented map of the full extent of the tunnels.\n\nIn the event of a Russian assault on Odesa, the local knowledge of the underground passages might prove to be an extremely valuable asset for the defenders. The fact that more than 1,000 entrances to the catacombs have been identified should surely give Russian attackers pause before commencing any attack upon the city – just as the tunnels under a steelworks in Mariupol forced Putin to rethinks plans to storm the facility.', 'image': 'https://images.theconversation.com/files/459531/original/file-20220425-26-z10wv.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=5%2C190%2C3410%2C1705&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:47'}

But this will not work in Russia,” Putin claimed.\n\nWhile the Kremlin has been accusing the West of attempting to divide Russian society, Western countries have been alleging that Moscow suppresses opposition, independent media, and even dissent in general. This kind of criticism has intensified following the launch of the offensive in Ukraine and subsequent measures taken by Moscow to crack down on “fake news” and so-called “foreign agents.”\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.', 'image': 'https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.04/article/6266cb9985f54054ee16cb06.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:33'}

Here’s today’s news.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – FIGHTING\n\nRussia has made small advances after beginning to focus on the full occupation of the Donbas region, but the lack of resources and combat support is making it hard for the Russian troops to occupy the region, the U.K. Defense Ministry has said in an intelligence update. Russia’s Ministry of Defense has proposed that the military handle payments to families of deceased soldiers, suggesting that Russia is trying to hide the extensive war losses from its own population, the update added. Ayumi Fujimoto reports for NBC News.\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine came under Russian fire this morning, delaying train services, Oleksandr Kamyshim chairman of Ukrainian Railways said in a Telegram post. Julian Duplain reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussia has said that it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 96 miles northeast of the border with Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 local time (1800 EST) and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people. Reuters reports.\n\nNine Russian missiles struck infrastructure in Kremenchuk, an industrial city in central Ukraine, yesterday according to a regional leader. “The enemy does not shy away from anything, even on such a holy day,” Dmytro Lunin, an acting governor and head of the Poltava region’s military administration, wrote on Telegram. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussian attacks targeting the towns of Gorske and Zolote in the eastern Luhansk region killed six people on Saturday, the region’s governor, Sergiy Haida has said. Cora Engelbrecht reports for the New York Times.\n\nA series of artillery strikes hit central and east Kharkiv on Saturday, including a large residential area. There were no casualties in the strike on central Kharkiv, officials said. Thomas Gibbons-Neff reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussia is planning a staged referendum in the Ukrainian city of Kherson to justify “its occupation,” according to the U.K.’s Defense Ministry. “The city is key to Russia’s objective of establishing a land bridge to Crimea and dominating southern Ukraine,” the ministry tweeted in an intelligence update. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – MARIUPOL\n\nUkrainian forces are still in full control of the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol and have repelled continuous assaults by Russian infantry, Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Battalion, said yesterday. Ukrainian forces are willing to leave the factory and evacuate the city if given guarantees of safe passage for themselves and hundreds of civilians, Palamar said. Michael Schwirtz reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussian troops may be preparing for a renewed assault on the Azovstal steel plant, according to an update by Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War. BBC News reports.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross issued a statement yesterday saying that it was “deeply alarmed” by the situation in Mariupol. The statement called for unimpeded access to help residents, including hundreds of wounded. Marc Santora and Austin Ramzy report for the New York Times.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – U.S. RESPONSE\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said during an unannounced trip to Kyiv on Sunday that U.S. diplomats would return to Ukraine this week. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to the Ukrainian capital, where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials, making them the highest-level US officials to have traveled to the country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hanlser report for CNN.\n\nBridget Brink, who is currently the ambassador to Slovakia, is expected to be named as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine – a position that has been left vacant since early 2020 under former President Trump’s administration. President Joe Biden will likely nominate her later today. María Paúl and Missy Ryan report for the Washington Post.\n\nAt the meeting in Kyiv, the U.S. pledged more than $700m in military financing to help Ukraine’s war efforts, officials have said. About half of the money will go to Ukraine, while the rest will be split among NATO members and other regional allies. In addition, the US will sell $165m of ammunition to Ukraine. BBC News reports.\n\nRussia is failing in its war aims but Ukraine is succeeding, Blinken said following his and Austin’s meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Reuters reports.\n\nThe United States hopes the war in Ukraine will result in a “weakened” Russia that no longer has the capacity to invade its neighbors, Austin told reporters during his trip to Kyiv. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said. Annabelle Timsit and Julie Yoon report for the Washington Post.\n\nZelenskyy has thanked the US for its “unprecedented” support for Ukraine, following his meeting with Blinken and Austin yesterday. “We appreciate the unprecedented assistance of the United States to Ukraine. I would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, for his personal clear position. To thank all the American people, as well as the Congress for their bicameral and bipartisan support. We see it. We feel it,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukraine’s presidential website reports.\n\nAlina Kabaeva, the woman the U.S. government believes to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend, has been spared sanctions in a last-minute decision. U.S. officials believe that sanctioning Kabaeva would be deemed so personal a blow to Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the U.S.. Vivian Salama, Joe Parkinson and Drew Hinshaw report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMultiple governors have announced that their state National Guards would be sending armored vehicles to Ukraine in response to a request from the Pentagon. Gov. Mike DeWine (R- OH) and Gov. Jim Justice (R – WV) announced that their state National Guards would be providing an unspecified number of M-113 armored personnel carriers, which help move equipment and soldiers “while providing protection from small arms fire and the effects of artillery,” according to press releases from both governors’ offices. Caroline Vakil reports for The Hill.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – GLOBAL RESPONSE\n\nIn recent days Russian authorities have stopped publishing data on government debt, trade statistics and oil production, while lawmakers work on a bill banning lenders from sharing data with foreign states. The growing blackout is part of an effort by the Russian authorities to protect the economy and domestic companies from further sanctions by the West. Limited data means that Washington and Brussels will have less visibility on whether and how their sanctions are working. Georgi Kantchev reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTop Ukrainian officials yesterday expressed disapproval of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of the officer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told NBC in an interview that Guterres is “not really” authorized to speak on behalf of the Ukrainian government. Quint Forget reports for POLITICO.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\n\nRussia has proposed the forced donation of blood by captured Ukrainian soldiers, according to Ukrainian ombudsperson for Human Rights, Lyudmila Denisova. “This fact testifies to the analogy of the atrocities of the Nazis in the concentration camps during the Second World War,” she said in a post on Facebook. Aaron Reich reports for the Jerusalem Post.\n\nGreenpeace activists have sought to block a tanker from delivering Russian oil to Norway, chaining themselves to the vessel in a protest against the war in Ukraine. As of this morning, the Ust Luga product tanker is anchored outside Exxon Mobil’s Slagen oil terminal some 43 miles south of the capital Oslo, according to the vessel tracker Marine Traffic. “Oil is not only at the root of the climate crisis but also of wars and conflicts. I am shocked that Norway operates as a free port for Russian oil, which we know finances Putin’s warfare,” Greenpeace Norway head Frode Pleym said. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine’s postal service has said it was targeted by a cyberattack on Friday following to sale of stamps portraying a Ukrainian soldier making a crude gesture to a Russian warship. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine has asked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a list of equipment that is necessary for the reliable and safe operation of its nuclear facilities during the war. The list specifically mentions radiation measuring instruments, shielding materials, electrical power systems and diesel generators. The IAEA reports.\n\nOTHER U.S. RELATIONS\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said yesterday that the current scale of espionage and cybersecurity threats from China were “unprecedented in history.” He noted that China’s hacking program is larger “than that of every other major nation combined,” adding that China’s targets span nearly every sector of the economy. Monique Balls reports for The Hill.\n\nThe Chinese government is not only mistreating Uyghurs within China’s borders, it is hunting them down abroad with help from countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, according to a new report by the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S.. More than 5,500 Uyghurs outside of China have been targeted by Beijing, hit with cyberattacks and threats to family members who remain in China, and more than 1,500 Uyghurs have been detained or forced to return to China to face imprisonment and torture in police custody, according to the report. Anna Schecter reports for NBC News.\n\nPresident Biden yesterday issued a statement memorializing the Armenian genocide. “Let us redouble our efforts toward healing and building the better, more peaceful world that we wish for our children … A world where human rights are respected, where the evils of bigotry and intolerance do not mark our daily lives, and where people everywhere are free to pursue their lives in dignity and security,” the statement said. David Cohen reports for POLITICO.\n\nOTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nEmmanuel Macron won a second term as president of France yesterday, triumphing over his far-right challenger, Marine Le Pen. Projections at the close of voting, which are generally reliable, showed Macron gaining 58.5 per cent of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5 per cent. His victory was much narrower than in 2017 when the margin was 66.1 per cent to 33.9 per cent for Le Pen. Roger Cohen reports for the New York Times.\n\nPreliminary results for Slovenia’s parliamentary elections show that right-wing Prime Minister Janez Jansa has lost to centrist rivals. With 95 per cent of the vote counted, results indicated that Jansa’s Slovenian Democratic Party had won around 24 per cent of the vote. That is far behind the 34 per cent of its main rival, the centrist Freedom Movement, meaning that Jansa is highly unlikely to keep his post as prime minister. Andrew Higgins reports for the New York Times.\n\nIsrael yesterday closed its civilian border crossing with the Gaza Strip, preventing thousands of Gazans from getting to work in Israel, in an effort to pressure Gaza’s ruler Hamas to halt rocket attacks against southern Israel. The closure comes after Palestinian militants fired two rockets at Israel Friday night and one on Saturday morning. Dov Lieber reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHundreds of Arab militia fighters, attacked a village in Sudan’s western Darfur region yesterday, torching homes and shops and killing at least 150 people, according to aid groups and U.N. officials. The violence, which later spread to a nearby town, was the latest in a series of clashes involving Arab and ethnic African groups in Darfur in recent months. Declan Walsh reports for the New York Times.\n\nBritish man, Luke Symons, who was held captive in Yemen without charge or trial for five years has been released from jail. U.K. foreign secretary, Liz Truss, confirmed yesterday that Symons “would shortly be reunited with his family.” She thanked Omani and Saudi negotiators as well as U.K. Foreign Office staff as he was released alongside 13 other foreign nationals in Yemen. Joe Middleton reports for the Guardian.\n\nThree policemen were killed in central Nigeria’s Kogi state on Saturday after gunmen stormed a police station in an attack claimed by Islamic State. The attack came a day after explosives planted at a bar in northeast Nigeria injured 11 people. Anna MacSwan reports for the Guardian.\n\nHealth authorities in the Democratic Republic and Congo have declared a new outbreak of Ebola, the Work Health organisation reported yesterday. So far, just one case has been confirmed and investigations to determine the source of the outbreak are ongoing. U.N. News Centre reports.\n\nSaudi princes have sold more than $600 million worth of real estate, yachts and artwork in the U.S. and Europe since the kingdom’s de facto ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman tightened the purse strings of the ultrawealthy ruling family. The transactions represent a radical change of fortune for senior princes who funnelled windfalls from oil booms in the 1970s and 1980s into some of the world’s most exclusive markets. “They’ve clearly been cut down to a disciplined, defined regimen and are having to live on that,” said British historian Robert Lacey, who has chronicled the Saudi ruling family since the 1980s. Prince Mohammed is “here for the long term and he’s reshaping things in a long-term fashion.” Stephen Kalin reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nJAN. 6, 2021 ATTACK\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was confronted in court on Friday over past social media posts advocating violence against Democrats. At the hearing in Atlanta, to determine if Greene is constitutionally barred from running for reelection because of her alleged role in the Jan. 6 attack, the congressperson repeatedly said she couldn’t remember past comments or interactions. Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck report for CNN.\n\nOTHER DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS\n\nTwitter Inc. is in discussions to sell itself to Elon Musk and could finalize a deal as soon as this week. The two sides met Sunday to discuss Musk’s proposal and were making progress, according to sources familiar with the matter. However, there is no guarantee they will reach a deal. Cara Lombardo and Dana Cimilluca report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nA U.S. Air Force general officer has been found guilty of abusive sexual contact, in the first-ever court-martial trial and conviction of a general officer in the history of the military branch. Maj. Gen. William T. Cooley was found guilty on one of three specifications of sexual assault connected to a 2018 incident in New Mexico, the Air Force said in a statement. Aaron Pellish reports for CNN.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments today in the case of Joseph Kennedy – a Washington state high school football coach who lost his job after he refused to stop praying on the field immediately after games. “There is good reason to think that its newly expanded conservative majority will not only rule in Kennedy’s favor but also make a major statement about the role religion may play in public life,” Adam Liptak reports for the New York Times.\n\nThis morning a judge will consider whether to hold former President Trump in contempt for violating a court order that he comply with a subpoena regarding a civil investigation into his business practices. New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is asking a state court judge to fine Trump $10,000 for each day that he has failed to turn over documents relevant to the subpoena. Harper Neidig reports for The Hill.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray yesterday highlighted an increase in violence against police officers last year, including a jump in police murders. “Violence against law enforcement in this country is one of the biggest phenomena that I think doesn’t get enough attention,” Wray said in an interview, adding that in 2021, “officers were being killed at a rate of almost one every five days.” Monique Beals reports for The Hill.\n\nA Colorado man who set himself on fire in front of the Supreme Court on Friday in an apparent Earth Day protest against climate change has died. The Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C., said that Wynn Bruce, 50, of Boulder, Colo., died on Saturday from his injuries after being airlifted to a hospital following the incident. Chris Cameron reports for the New York Times.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 has infected over 80.98 million people and has now killed over 991.254 people in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Globally, there have been over 507.56 million confirmed coronavirus cases and over 6.21 million deaths.

"Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness."\n\nThe ministry added that, so far, Russia has only made "minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas."\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," the ministry said.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was scheduled to travel to Turkey on Monday and then Moscow and Kyiv. Zelenskyy said it was a mistake for Guterres to visit Russia before Ukraine.\n\n"Why? To hand over signals from Russia? What should we look for?" Zelenskyy said Saturday. "There are no corpses scattered on the Kutuzovsky Prospect," he said, referring to one of Moscow\'s main avenues.\n\nIn a boost in support for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to dilute France\'s ties with the European Union and NATO. Le Pen had also spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.\n\nMacron\'s victory was hailed by France\'s allies in the EU as a reassuring sign of stability and continued support for Ukraine. France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons systems to Ukraine.\n\n"We have a lot to do and the war in Ukraine reminds us that we are going through tragic times where France must make its voice heard," Macron told a cheering crowd in his victory speech.\n\nZelenskyy\'s meeting with U.S. officials, his first face-to-face talks with a top American official since a Feb. 19 meeting in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris, took place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter. Speaking from Kyiv\'s ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted its significance to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\n\n"The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!" he said.\n\nTo Ukraine\'s north on the Russian side of the border, a fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot, but no immediate cause was given for the blaze in oil storage tanks.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires showed something burning at coordinates that corresponded to a Rosneft facility some 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Moscow previously has blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nSince failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians have aimed to gain full control over the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war.\n\nFor the Donbas offensive, Russia has reassembled troops who fought around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine. The British Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week and "inflicted significant cost on Russian forces."\n\nIn the south of the Donbas, in the strategic port city of Mariupol, a small pocket of Ukrainian troops continues to hold out against Russian forces in the Azovstal steel factory, a sprawling facility on the waterfront.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the building.\n\nNew satellite images by Planet Labs PBC, taken Sunday, show destroyed buildings across the steelworks and smoke rising from one part of the facility. Roofs have gaping holes; a soccer field is cratered from incoming fire.\n\nMore than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate more than 20,000 civilians have been killed. Recent satellite images showed what appeared to be mass graves to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nChildren in an underground bunker were seen receiving Easter presents in a video released Sunday by the far-right Azov Battalion, which is among the Ukrainian forces at the steel plant in Mariupol. The group\'s deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, said the video was shot at the plant.\n\nOne toddler is seen wearing homemade diapers made of cellophane and people are seen hanging laundry on makeshift hangers.\n\n"Please help us," one woman in the video said through tears, appealing to world leaders.

In addition, Blinken and Austin have announced the provision of more than $700 million in additional direct and indirect military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAt the heart of their talks with President, Volodymyr Zelensky was Kyiv\'s demand for heavier weapons to stop the Russian offensive in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe $713 million aid will be distributed between Ukraine and 15 other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. About $322 million is for Kyiv. The rest are allies who have sent aid to Ukraine since the start of the war to get the weapons they need.\n\nThe total amount of military supplies from the United States to Ukraine reached 3.7 billion dollars.\n\n"We do not know how the war will develop from now on, but we know that the existence of a sovereign, independent Ukraine will last much longer than the presence of Vladimir Putin. We will continue to support Ukraine until final success is achieved," said Antony Blinken at a press conference after the visit, adding that it is an expression of American support for the leadership of Ukraine. He added that he had talked with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will visit Moscow and Kyiv this week, to convey a strong message to President Putin to end the war, a truce to be achieved and the evacuation of civilians from dangerous areas to finally occur.\n\nMoscow, for its part, has sent a note to Washington calling for an end to US arms supplies to Ukraine, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said.\n\n"Have we served a note - yes, we have emphasized that it is an unacceptable situation in which the United States is filling Ukraine with weapons," he said, adding that Russia had called for an end to the practice.\n\nBlinken and Austin are the first US government officials to visit Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The war, which entered its third month, killed thousands and killed 5,500 refugees. Kyiv is also seeking help for Ukrainians stranded in the ruined city of Mariupol. According to the mayor, more than 100,000 people are still there and cannot be evacuated. Ukraine\'s defense in Mariupol is on the verge of collapse, admitted Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to President Zelensky. He also said that high-ranking US officials would not have come to Kyiv if "they were not ready to give up weapons".\n\nEarlier, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said that Russian troops not only did not respond to calls for a ceasefire but also prevented the population from leaving Mariupol and seeking refuge in the interior of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the ceasefire, Kyiv insists on safe and several-day humanitarian corridors for civilians who want to leave Mariupol and go to Kyiv-controlled territories. Authorities in Kyiv will also demand the release or exchange of their fighters, who are still trapped at the Azovstal plant.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Zelensky spoke with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to mediate a truce in Mariupol. Turkey views "in principle positively" the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine after the end of the war with Russia. This was stated in a statement issued by the presidential institution in Ankara after Erdogan\'s telephone conversation with Zelensky.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene," the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media.\n\n3:37pm: Ukraine war has consequences for Asia, EU chief warns neutral India\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine threatens India\'s regional security, the European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Monday during a trip to New Delhi aimed at fostering deeper strategic ties.\n\nVon der Leyen is the latest visiting Western diplomat to press India, which gets most of its arms from Russia, over its neutral stance on the conflict.\n\nBoth the EU and India face challenges from a rising China, and von der Leyen raised the spectre of Beijing\'s partnership with Moscow to warn the war had consequences further afield than Europe.\n\n"The outcome of the war will not only determine the future of Europe but also deeply affect the Indo-Pacific region," she told an audience at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitical conference in New Delhi.\n\n"Russia and China have forged a seemingly unrestrained pact. They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war. Since the beginning of April, just under 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, after some 3.4 million left in March.\n\nThe UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an additional 218,000 citizens of third countries—largely students and migrant workers—have also fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began.\n\nWomen and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.\n\nBeyond the refugees, the IOM estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Ukrainian children have had to flee their homes, including those who remain in the country.\n\n2:45pm: Visit by top US officials sign of improved security situation in Kyiv\n\nA visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday is a strong sign that the security situation in Ukraine\'s capital has improved. FRANCE 24\'s Gulliver Cragg reports.\n\n03:11 © France 24\n\n1:08pm: Biden nominates ambassador to Ukraine\n\nUS President Joe Biden has nominated Bridget Brink, the current ambassador to Slovakia, to be the new US ambassador to Ukraine, according to a White House statement.\n\nA foreign service career member, Brink has previously worked at the US embassies in Uzbekistan and Georgia.\n\nThe position must be confirmed by the US Senate.\n\nThe announcement came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised a renewed diplomatic push between Washington and Kyiv during his visit to Ukraine.\n\nBlinken said the small staff from the now-shuttered US Embassy in Kyiv, which has relocated to Poland from temporary offices in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, would begin making day trips to Lviv in the coming days.Though several European countries have already reopened their embassies in Kyiv, the return will be gradual for US diplomats, said Blinken.\n\n1:05pm: Putin accuses West of trying to murder Russian journalists\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of trying to murder Russian journalists and claimed the country’s intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), had thwarted one such attempt on a TV reporter.\n\nSpeaking on state television, Putin accused foreign special forces, including the CIA, of attempting to advise Kyiv on the murder of Russian journalists.\n\nPutin did not, however, provide evidence to support his claim.\n\n12:32pm: Ukraine denies any deal of ceasefire near Azovstal plant\n\nUkrainian authorities denied that there had been any agreement on a humanitarian corridor despite an announcement from Russia.\n\n“It is important to understand that a humanitarian corridor opens by the agreement of both sides," Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshschuk said on the Telegram messaging app. "A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor."\n\nRussia\'s defence ministry on Monday announced a ceasefire around the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to allow a civilian evacuation from the industrial area that has been sheltering the remaining Ukrainian resistance in the port city.\n\nRussian troops "from 14:00 Moscow time (1100 GMT) on April 25, 2022, will unilaterally stop any hostilities, withdraw units to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal of" civilians, the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\n10:36am: Russian rockets hit Vinnytsia region, deaths reported: governor\n\nRussia fired rockets at two towns in Ukraine\'s central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\n"Today, Vinnytsia region is once again under rocket fire (in) the towns of Zhmerynka and Kozyatyn. The enemy is attempting to hit critical infrastructure," Borzov said in a video released on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nRussia did not immediately comment on his remarks.\n\n10:29am: Russia strikes Ukrainian oil depot, defence ministry says\n\nRussia struck Ukraine\'s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles, according to the Russian defence ministry.\n\n"High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops," the ministry said.\n\nThe governor of the the Poltava region where Kremenchuk is based had said the refinery was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n9:25am: Five railway stations come under fire: Ukrainian state rail company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday morning, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n9:08am: US wants Russia \'weakened\' so it cannot invade again: Austin\n\nThe US wants Russia\'s military capability weakened so that it cannot carry out another invasion, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told journalists after returning from a trip to Kyiv.\n\n"We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," Austin told a group of journalists in Poland.\n\nAustin also said Ukraine can win the war against Russia if it had the right equipment. "The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win," he said. "We believe that we can win, they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support."\n\n7:41am: UK says Russia made minor advances in Ukraine after its shift to Donbas\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the eastern Donbas region, the UK\'s Ministry of Defence has tweeted.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nUkraine\'s defence of the southern city of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 25 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/7NVrOfB161\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/OfcnHgGfR3 — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 25, 2022\n\n6:41am: US aid to Ukraine and neighbours, diplomatic presence in Kyiv\n\nDuring their visit to Kyiv on Sunday – the highest-level US visit since the Russian invasion on February 24 – Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his advisers that the US would provide more than $300 million in foreign military financing and had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition.\n\nMoney will also go to Ukraine\'s regional allies who need to resupply after sending weapons to their neighbour.\n\nThey also said US President Joe Biden would soon announce his nominee for ambassador to Ukraine and that US diplomats who left Ukraine before the war would start returning to the country this coming week. The US embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for the moment.\n\nBlinken said Biden in the coming days planned to nominate the current US ambassador to Slovakia, Bridget Brink, as the new ambassador to Kyiv, a post that has been officially empty since 2019.\n\nThough several European countries have already reopened their embassies in Kyiv, the return will be gradual for American diplomats, according to a State Department official.\n\n"Since the start of hostilities, we\'ve had a team across the border in Poland who\'s been handling this work for us," the official told reporters waiting for Blinken and Austin on the Polish side of the border.\n\n"Starting this week, members of that team will be able to do day trips instead into Ukraine," he said.

The next day, EU leaders gathered for an extraordinary summit. At that time, they thought the war would only last a few days…\n\nThis seems like ancient history now.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to EU leaders at that summit via video link. Shortly after, the author of this Brief met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who said leaders reeled in shock because Zelenskyy’s video call seemed like a final goodbye.\n\n“One shudders because this man who is asking for help and support may not be alive in the next 48 hours”, Petkov said.\n\nSince then, it has become apparent that the Russian army was not as efficient as we thought, and Ukrainian resistance is not only heroic but potent.\n\nArms started to arrive in Ukraine, Kyiv became safe enough to receive visits from foreign officials, and Zelenskyy addressed parliaments across the world.\n\nRussia re-hashed its strategy, abandoning plans for total dominance via a puppet government and concentrating on territories in the east and south of Ukraine that it still hopes to capture and retain.\n\nChances for a ceasefire are linked with a scenario in which one of the two sides is close to capitulation. But as long as both sides harbour other ambitions – Ukraine to regain most of its territory and Russia to obtain full access to the Black Sea – it is unrealistic to imagine a peace agreement.\n\nBesides, the West now looks set to offer Ukraine whatever weapons it needs, while Russia has no other option but to fight because a defeat is simply not an option for President Vladimir Putin. The main risk factor remains that Putin might be tempted to use arms of mass destruction at some point.\n\nBut if this war remains conventional, as we hope, it is safe to assume that it may last a very long time. And if this is the case, we must concede the war will transform Europe and possibly the world.\n\nThe EU was blind to internal developments in Russia during the run-up to the war, which sought to restore “the glory” of the USSR by force.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU remains over-dependent on Russian oil and gas and vulnerable to Russian propaganda and policy of sowing divisions.\n\nIn hindsight, we can say that the most naïve country was Germany, perceived until recently as our Union’s leader. Conversely, perhaps the most alert country was Poland, who has been fighting a rule-of-law war with the European Commission – a dispute that looks rather unhelpful in the current context.\n\nWhen Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in 2019 that she had ambitions to lead a ‘geopolitical Commission’, she could not know that she would have no other choice three years on. EU policies are changing, taboos are disappearing, and bureaucrats are being pushed out of their comfort zone.\n\nIf, for example, the EU cannot reach an agreement on sanctioning the oil imports from Russia, it should abandon the unanimity rule, which serves nobody else but Putin. This would also significantly reduce the power of nuisance leaders like Viktor Orban.\n\nIt should be up to the Commission to make sure that detractors are excluded from specific funding and opportunities. This is part of building the EU’s resilience.\n\nWhile the war drags on, it is safe to bet that the EU will change more than it has done in decades.\n\nIt is good for Europe that the French President Emmanuel Macron has won a second mandate and that in Slovenia, Eurosceptic Janez Janša was badly beaten.\n\nIf the mainstream politicians take the social challenges in their countries seriously, the far-right politicians, who have already lost Putin as an icon, will be squeezed into the corner.\n\nEuropeans are capable of solidarity and will show the best of themselves and perhaps Europe will have a new generation of war leaders, as it did after World War II.\n\nThe Roundup\n\nWith the ongoing French EU Council presidency and the upcoming parliamentary elections, Emmanuel Macron will enjoy no grace period in his second mandate and the opposition, both on the left and the right, is more determined than ever to strip the newly re-elected president of his parliamentary majority.\n\nTwitter Inc is nearing a deal to sell itself to Elon Musk for $54.20 per share in cash, the price that he originally offered to the social media company and called his ‘best and final’, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIf you want to read up on how Slovenia fared in its parliamentary election on Sunday, we’ve got you covered: Conservatives are out, a progressive government is in.\n\nEurope’s market for hydrogen-powered taxis is becoming increasingly competitive, with French company Hype, which has developed them in Paris since 2015, being among the frontrunners.\n\nThe EU and India are set to announce closer cooperation and an imminent relaunch of negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement on Monday, as part of Western efforts to help decrease the world’s second-most populous country’s dependence on Russia.\n\nLook out for…\n\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee holds public hearing on encouraging engagement of young people towards achieving sustainable development.\n\nCouncil of Europe holds conference on ‘Speaking Human Rights Online’.\n\nViews are the author’s.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Shared-Link-The-Hub-Article-Templates-Options-44-800x450.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:09'}

The two leaders haven’t seen completely eye-to-eye on responding to Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine. Macron has called for dialogue with Moscow to help bring peace, and he has chosen not to follow his US counterpart and other NATO leaders in branding Putin a “war criminal” and accusing Russian forces of committing “genocide.” In fact, he suggested earlier this month that such rhetoric isn’t conducive to ending the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“Genocide has a meaning,” Macron said. “The Ukrainian people and Russian people are brotherly people. It’s madness what’s happening today. It’s unbelievable brutality and a return to war in Europe. But at the same time, I look at the facts, and I want to continue to try the utmost to be able to stop the war and restore peace. I’m not sure if the escalation of words serves our cause.”\n\nLate last month, after Biden called Putin a “butcher” and said he “cannot remain in power,” Macron countered that leaders must use restraint in speaking about the crisis. “We want to stop the war that Russia has launched in Ukraine without escalation – that’s the objective,” Macron said. “If this is what we want to do, we should not escalate things – neither with words nor actions.”\n\nThe two leaders also clashed last year, such as when Macron admonished Biden for “abandoning” pro-Western allies in Afghanistan and argued that the countries had a “moral responsibility” toward the Afghan people – remarks that were scrubbed from a White House summary of the conversation. Macron’s administration last September recalled its ambassador to Washington and accused Biden of behaving like Trump after Washington partnered with the UK to persuade Australia to scrap a submarine deal with France and instead buy their vessels.\n\nWhite House calls to foreign leaders are typically arranged by staffers to avoid unscripted moments or gaffes. In March, leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates reportedly declined to take calls from Biden, who was expected to urge them to ramp up oil production amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.', 'image': 'https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.04/article/6266f1f385f54062be603df2.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:01:27'}

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:51'}

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\n\nApril 26 (Reuters) - (Note: Some images in this story may offend or disturb.)\n\nThree Russian pilots suspected of bombing civilian buildings in the Kharkiv and Sumy regions are among at least seven Russian military personnel that Kyiv is preparing war crimes charges against, the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office told Reuters.\n\nIt said the other individuals include two operators of a rocket launcher who allegedly shelled settlements in the Kharkiv region and two army servicemen suspected of murdering a Kyiv area resident and raping his wife.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThe prosecutor’s office said it had notified the individuals that they are suspects and the investigations are ongoing, adding no charges had been filed with the court. It didn’t name the suspects or provide evidence to support the allegations. It said some of the suspects were held as captives, without specifying where, while other charges were being prepared in absentia.\n\nUkraine says it is investigating some 7,600 potential war crimes and at least 500 suspects following Russia\'s Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told Reuters that many of those suspects are in Russia but some have been taken captive by Ukraine as prisoners of war. Speaking in an interview earlier this month, she said that her office intends to follow the chain of command up the Russian political and military hierarchy.\n\nVenediktova added that she plans to pursue prosecutions both in Ukrainian courts as well as at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, the world’s permanent war crimes tribunal.\n\nThe Kremlin and Russia’s defence ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment. Moscow has rejected allegations by Ukraine and Western nations of war crimes and has denied targeting civilians in what the Kremlin calls a "special military operation" to demilitarise its neighbour.\n\nUkraine’s probe is at the centre of multiple efforts to investigate potential war crimes related to the conflict, including by the ICC. The probes are at the very early stages, people familiar with them say. The ICC has sent an advance team to the region to establish operations. read more\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of genocide against Russian speakers, which Kyiv strongly denies. Russia has also opened criminal cases into Ukrainian servicemen\'s alleged torture of their Russian counterparts. read more\n\nUkraine, which is conducting its investigation while still in the throes of war, is scrambling to assemble teams of specialists with war crimes expertise, evaluating potential crimes and developing its prosecution strategy.\n\n”You can see they are now exhuming the bodies, so [the investigation is at a] very early stage," a person familiar with the process said. In terms of strategy, Kyiv plans to prosecute as much as it can in Ukrainian courts but would likely leave any cases involving higher-ranking figures to the ICC, the person added.\n\nThe UN has also established its own inquiry into possible violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine, including possible war crimes, which could feed into any prosecutions by the ICC.\n\nThere is also a European Union-coordinated effort to fast track sharing of evidence between various investigating authorities, including with the ICC. Several European countries have said they will apply universal jurisdiction, the legal principle that some crimes are so terrible they can be heard by foreign national courts, and their prosecutors could launch investigations into Ukrainian atrocities.\n\nFor Ukraine, the immediate challenge is the sheer volume of potential evidence and witness testimony that needs to be secured and recorded in a way that is usable in court, legal specialists say. That includes vast amounts of digital imagery as well as material gathered on the ground.\n\nDavid Schwendiman, a former U.S. federal prosecutor who has also helped prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan wars in the 1990s, praised Ukraine’s prosecutor general as talented and courageous but said the country doesn’t have experience of an investigation of this scale and will need outside help processing potential crime scenes in a way that meets international standards.\n\n“Every one of those bodies is a crime scene. Every one of those buildings is a crime scene. Every city is a crime scene,” Schwendiman said. Something as small as a piece of cloth torn from a uniform, an ammunition shell or even a ligature used to tie someone’s hands could help identify a particular unit involved and so needs to be carefully preserved, he added.\n\nZera Kozlyieva, deputy head of the war crimes unit in the prosecutor general’s office, acknowledged that limited access due to ongoing hostilities and a shortage of war crimes specialists presented challenges. Speaking Thursday on a panel at international affairs think tank Chatham House, she said that Kyiv is seeking help from international experts.\n\nImages of dead civilians in Ukraine, including of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, have prompted international outrage, with U.S. President Joe Biden calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be investigated for war crimes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused invading Russian troops of committing "the most terrible war crimes" since World War Two.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, as of April 22 more than 2,400 civilians had been killed since the conflict began in late February. But the official count is likely to climb. In the port city of Mariupol alone, local authorities have said thousands of people have been killed. read more\n\nUnder international law, war crimes include intentionally targeting civilian populations, willfully killing or causing suffering, and widespread destruction among other serious violations of laws applicable in armed conflict. Individuals who commit such crimes can be prosecuted by international tribunals such as the ICC and by states.\n\nExperts for the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) nations said in a report published earlier this month that they found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia in Ukraine. The experts also said in the report that they’d found evidence of violations of international humanitarian law by Ukraine, particularly in its treatment of prisoners of war, but that Russia\'s violations "are by far larger in nature and scale."\n\nUkraine has said it checks all information regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action. Russia has said the report "is based solely on unfounded propaganda theses, contains references to dubious sources and logical stretches in the style of \'highly likely.\'"\n\nUKRAINE’S PROBE\n\nThe prosecutor general’s office had in recent years established a special unit to investigate potential crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 but Kyiv continues to claim as part of Ukraine, and Donbas.\n\nMoscow’s February invasion of its Western neighbour forced Kyiv to scale up what had been a relatively small team of prosecutors.\n\nVenediktova and her team have in recent weeks been evaluating sites where atrocities have taken place, including where Russian troops have recently withdrawn.\n\nOn April 12, Venediktova visited Bucha, near Kyiv, where French forensic experts had arrived to help Ukraine authorities establish what happened in the town where hundreds of bodies have been discovered. As the group from the French Gendarmerie\'s forensic science department looked on, workers in hazmat suits dug earth from a shallow grave and lifted out a heavy mass wrapped in an orange blanket. Citing witnesses, Venediktova said during the visit that the burnt body parts inside were those of a woman and her two children. read more\n\nRussia has said that images and footage of dead bodies strewn across Bucha were fake.\n\nVenediktova is also drawing on international legal expertise and seeking technical assistance. She has announced the formation of a task force of law firms and prominent international human rights lawyers, including Amal Clooney, to advise on securing accountability for Ukrainian victims in national jurisdictions as well as strategic guidance on cooperating with the ICC.\n\nVenediktova is in regular contact with Beth Van Schaack, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice in the U.S. State Department, who said the two have discussed what additional assistance Washington could provide. Van Schaack’s office has been helping to deploy specialists on the ground via a joint U.S.-European project.\n\nVan Schaack told Reuters that Venediktova’s requests for assistance include forensics expertise, such as helping determine how victims found in mass graves died and whether potential signs of torture were inflicted prior to death. Other requests include help identifying the type and origins of particular ballistics used as well as assistance clearing any mines left by Russians so that her investigators can safely access those areas.\n\nUkraine’s potentially biggest challenge, said Van Schaack, will be gaining custody of suspects, particularly those higher up the command chain. If they remain in Russia, they may “enjoy impunity for the rest of their days,” she said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Anthony Deutsch in Amsterdam; additional reporting by Alessandra Prentice in Bucha, Pavel Polityuk in Kyiv, Max Hunder in London, Stephanie van den Berg in The Hague and Simon Lewis in Washington.

But here, too, there is a hitch; this hasn’t worked either,” Putin said.\n\nIn his opinion, Russian society “has shown maturity, solidarity,” and supports its armed forces and the efforts “to ensure Russia’s ultimate security and help the people living of Donbass.”\n\nAfter a ‘fiasco’ in the media field, Putin claimed, the West has turned “to terror, to arranging the murder of our journalists.”\n\nHe was referring to Monday’s announcement by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) that it had detained a group of “neo-Nazis” instructed by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) to kill popular Russian TV host and journalist Vladimir Solovyov. Kiev has denied any role in organizing the assassination attempt.\n\n“In this regard, it should be noted of course that we know the names of all the Western handlers, of all members of Western services, primarily the CIA, who are working with Ukrainian security agencies. Apparently, they are giving them such advice,” the Russian leader said.\n\nHe added sarcastically that “This is their attitude towards the rights of journalists, towards the dissemination of information; this is their attitude towards human rights in general.”\n\n“All they care about is their own rights, some cherishing imperial ambitions, others holding on to their colonial past in the old-fashioned way. But this will not work in Russia,” Putin claimed.\n\nWhile the Kremlin has been accusing the West of attempting to divide Russian society, Western countries have been alleging that Moscow suppresses opposition, independent media, and even dissent in general. This kind of criticism has intensified following the launch of the offensive in Ukraine and subsequent measures taken by Moscow to crack down on “fake news” and so-called “foreign agents.”\n\nRussia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.\n\nThe Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.', 'image': 'https://cdni.russiatoday.com/files/2022.04/article/6266cb9985f54054ee16cb06.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:33'}

The growing blackout is part of an effort by the Russian authorities to protect the economy and domestic companies from further sanctions by the West.

David Cohen reports for POLITICO.\n\nOTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nEmmanuel Macron won a second term as president of France yesterday, triumphing over his far-right challenger, Marine Le Pen. Projections at the close of voting, which are generally reliable, showed Macron gaining 58.5 per cent of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5 per cent.

With 95 per cent of the vote counted, results indicated that Jansa’s Slovenian Democratic Party had won around 24 per cent of the vote.

The transactions represent a radical change of fortune for senior princes who funnelled windfalls from oil booms in the 1970s and 1980s into some of the world’s most exclusive markets. “They’ve clearly been cut down to a disciplined, defined regimen and are having to live on that,” said British historian Robert Lacey, who has chronicled the Saudi ruling family since the 1980s.

Harper Neidig reports for The Hill.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray yesterday highlighted an increase in violence against police officers last year, including a jump in police murders. “Violence against law enforcement in this country is one of the biggest phenomena that I think doesn’t get enough attention,” Wray said in an interview, adding that in 2021, “officers were being killed at a rate of almost one every five days.” Monique Beals reports for The Hill.\n\nA Colorado man who set himself on fire in front of the Supreme Court on Friday in an apparent Earth Day protest against climate change has died.

"Ukraine\'s defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness."\n\nThe ministry added that, so far, Russia has only made "minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas."\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," the ministry said.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was scheduled to travel to Turkey on Monday and then Moscow and Kyiv. Zelenskyy said it was a mistake for Guterres to visit Russia before Ukraine.\n\n"Why? To hand over signals from Russia? What should we look for?" Zelenskyy said Saturday. "There are no corpses scattered on the Kutuzovsky Prospect," he said, referring to one of Moscow\'s main avenues.\n\nIn a boost in support for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to dilute France\'s ties with the European Union and NATO. Le Pen had also spoken out against EU sanctions on Russian energy and had faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.\n\nMacron\'s victory was hailed by France\'s allies in the EU as a reassuring sign of stability and continued support for Ukraine. France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons systems to Ukraine.\n\n"We have a lot to do and the war in Ukraine reminds us that we are going through tragic times where France must make its voice heard," Macron told a cheering crowd in his victory speech.\n\nZelenskyy\'s meeting with U.S. officials, his first face-to-face talks with a top American official since a Feb. 19 meeting in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris, took place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter. Speaking from Kyiv\'s ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted its significance to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war.\n\n"The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!" he said.\n\nTo Ukraine\'s north on the Russian side of the border, a fire erupted early Monday at an oil depot, but no immediate cause was given for the blaze in oil storage tanks.\n\nNASA satellites that track fires showed something burning at coordinates that corresponded to a Rosneft facility some 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Moscow previously has blamed Ukraine for attacks on the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine.\n\nSince failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians have aimed to gain full control over the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland, where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war.\n\nFor the Donbas offensive, Russia has reassembled troops who fought around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine. The British Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week and "inflicted significant cost on Russian forces."\n\nIn the south of the Donbas, in the strategic port city of Mariupol, a small pocket of Ukrainian troops continues to hold out against Russian forces in the Azovstal steel factory, a sprawling facility on the waterfront.\n\nMariupol has endured fierce fighting since the start of the war because of its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nOver the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the building.\n\nNew satellite images by Planet Labs PBC, taken Sunday, show destroyed buildings across the steelworks and smoke rising from one part of the facility. Roofs have gaping holes; a soccer field is cratered from incoming fire.\n\nMore than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate more than 20,000 civilians have been killed. Recent satellite images showed what appeared to be mass graves to the west and east of Mariupol.\n\nChildren in an underground bunker were seen receiving Easter presents in a video released Sunday by the far-right Azov Battalion, which is among the Ukrainian forces at the steel plant in Mariupol.

In addition, Blinken and Austin have announced the provision of more than $700 million in additional direct and indirect military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAt the heart of their talks with President, Volodymyr Zelensky was Kyiv\'s demand for heavier weapons to stop the Russian offensive in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe $713 million aid will be distributed between Ukraine and 15 other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. About $322 million is for Kyiv. The rest are allies who have sent aid to Ukraine since the start of the war to get the weapons they need.\n\nThe total amount of military supplies from the United States to Ukraine reached 3.7 billion dollars.\n\n"We do not know how the war will develop from now on, but we know that the existence of a sovereign, independent Ukraine will last much longer than the presence of Vladimir Putin. We will continue to support Ukraine until final success is achieved," said Antony Blinken at a press conference after the visit, adding that it is an expression of American support for the leadership of Ukraine. He added that he had talked with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will visit Moscow and Kyiv this week, to convey a strong message to President Putin to end the war, a truce to be achieved and the evacuation of civilians from dangerous areas to finally occur.\n\nMoscow, for its part, has sent a note to Washington calling for an end to US arms supplies to Ukraine, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said.\n\n"Have we served a note - yes, we have emphasized that it is an unacceptable situation in which the United States is filling Ukraine with weapons," he said, adding that Russia had called for an end to the practice.\n\nBlinken and Austin are the first US government officials to visit Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The war, which entered its third month, killed thousands and killed 5,500 refugees. Kyiv is also seeking help for Ukrainians stranded in the ruined city of Mariupol. According to the mayor, more than 100,000 people are still there and cannot be evacuated. Ukraine\'s defense in Mariupol is on the verge of collapse, admitted Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to President Zelensky. He also said that high-ranking US officials would not have come to Kyiv if "they were not ready to give up weapons".\n\nEarlier, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said that Russian troops not only did not respond to calls for a ceasefire but also prevented the population from leaving Mariupol and seeking refuge in the interior of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the ceasefire, Kyiv insists on safe and several-day humanitarian corridors for civilians who want to leave Mariupol and go to Kyiv-controlled territories. Authorities in Kyiv will also demand the release or exchange of their fighters, who are still trapped at the Azovstal plant.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Zelensky spoke with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to mediate a truce in Mariupol. Turkey views "in principle positively" the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine after the end of the war with Russia. This was stated in a statement issued by the presidential institution in Ankara after Erdogan\'s telephone conversation with Zelensky. Ukraine is pushing for collective security guarantees in exchange for its refusal to join NATO, pushed by Russian demands.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his re-election and said the French president was a "true friend of Ukraine".\n\n"Congratulations to the president and true friend Emmanuel Macron on his election victory," Zelensky wrote on his Twitter account earlier this morning.\n\nMacron is seeking a diplomatic solution to halt the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene," the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media.\n\n3:37pm: Ukraine war has consequences for Asia, EU chief warns neutral India\n\nRussia\'s invasion of Ukraine threatens India\'s regional security, the European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Monday during a trip to New Delhi aimed at fostering deeper strategic ties.\n\nVon der Leyen is the latest visiting Western diplomat to press India, which gets most of its arms from Russia, over its neutral stance on the conflict.\n\nBoth the EU and India face challenges from a rising China, and von der Leyen raised the spectre of Beijing\'s partnership with Moscow to warn the war had consequences further afield than Europe.\n\n"The outcome of the war will not only determine the future of Europe but also deeply affect the Indo-Pacific region," she told an audience at the Raisina Dialogue, an annual geopolitical conference in New Delhi.\n\n"Russia and China have forged a seemingly unrestrained pact. They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war. Since the beginning of April, just under 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, after some 3.4 million left in March.\n\nThe UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an additional 218,000 citizens of third countries—largely students and migrant workers—have also fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion began.\n\nWomen and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.\n\nBeyond the refugees, the IOM estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Ukrainian children have had to flee their homes, including those who remain in the country.\n\n2:45pm: Visit by top US officials sign of improved security situation in Kyiv\n\nA visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday is a strong sign that the security situation in Ukraine\'s capital has improved. FRANCE 24\'s Gulliver Cragg reports.\n\n03:11 © France 24\n\n1:08pm: Biden nominates ambassador to Ukraine\n\nUS President Joe Biden has nominated Bridget Brink, the current ambassador to Slovakia, to be the new US ambassador to Ukraine, according to a White House statement.\n\nA foreign service career member, Brink has previously worked at the US embassies in Uzbekistan and Georgia.\n\nThe position must be confirmed by the US Senate.\n\nThe announcement came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised a renewed diplomatic push between Washington and Kyiv during his visit to Ukraine.\n\nBlinken said the small staff from the now-shuttered US Embassy in Kyiv, which has relocated to Poland from temporary offices in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, would begin making day trips to Lviv in the coming days.Though several European countries have already reopened their embassies in Kyiv, the return will be gradual for US diplomats, said Blinken.\n\n1:05pm: Putin accuses West of trying to murder Russian journalists\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of trying to murder Russian journalists and claimed the country’s intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), had thwarted one such attempt on a TV reporter.\n\nSpeaking on state television, Putin accused foreign special forces, including the CIA, of attempting to advise Kyiv on the murder of Russian journalists.\n\nPutin did not, however, provide evidence to support his claim.\n\n12:32pm: Ukraine denies any deal of ceasefire near Azovstal plant\n\nUkrainian authorities denied that there had been any agreement on a humanitarian corridor despite an announcement from Russia.\n\n“It is important to understand that a humanitarian corridor opens by the agreement of both sides," Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshschuk said on the Telegram messaging app. "A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor."\n\nRussia\'s defence ministry on Monday announced a ceasefire around the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to allow a civilian evacuation from the industrial area that has been sheltering the remaining Ukrainian resistance in the port city.\n\nRussian troops "from 14:00 Moscow time (1100 GMT) on April 25, 2022, will unilaterally stop any hostilities, withdraw units to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal of" civilians, the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\n10:36am: Russian rockets hit Vinnytsia region, deaths reported: governor\n\nRussia fired rockets at two towns in Ukraine\'s central Vinnytsia region, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional Governor Serhiy Borzov reported.\n\n"Today, Vinnytsia region is once again under rocket fire (in) the towns of Zhmerynka and Kozyatyn. The enemy is attempting to hit critical infrastructure," Borzov said in a video released on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nRussia did not immediately comment on his remarks.\n\n10:29am: Russia strikes Ukrainian oil depot, defence ministry says\n\nRussia struck Ukraine\'s Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles, according to the Russian defence ministry.\n\n"High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops," the ministry said.\n\nThe governor of the the Poltava region where Kremenchuk is based had said the refinery was destroyed earlier this month.\n\n9:25am: Five railway stations come under fire: Ukrainian state rail company\n\nFive railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday morning, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying.\n\nOleksander Kamyshin, the company\'s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked.\n\n9:08am: US wants Russia \'weakened\' so it cannot invade again: Austin\n\nThe US wants Russia\'s military capability weakened so that it cannot carry out another invasion, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told journalists after returning from a trip to Kyiv.\n\n"We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\'t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine," Austin told a group of journalists in Poland.\n\nAustin also said Ukraine can win the war against Russia if it had the right equipment. "The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win," he said. "We believe that we can win, they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support."\n\n7:41am: UK says Russia made minor advances in Ukraine after its shift to Donbas\n\nRussia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the eastern Donbas region, the UK\'s Ministry of Defence has tweeted.\n\n"Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," it said.\n\nUkraine\'s defence of the southern city of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 25 April 2022\n\n\n\nFind out more about the UK government\'s response: https://t.co/7NVrOfB161\n\n\n\n🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/OfcnHgGfR3 — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 25, 2022\n\n6:41am: US aid to Ukraine and neighbours, diplomatic presence in Kyiv\n\nDuring their visit to Kyiv on Sunday – the highest-level US visit since the Russian invasion on February 24 – Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his advisers that the US would provide more than $300 million in foreign military financing and had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition.\n\nMoney will also go to Ukraine\'s regional allies who need to resupply after sending weapons to their neighbour.\n\nThey also said US President Joe Biden would soon announce his nominee for ambassador to Ukraine and that US diplomats who left Ukraine before the war would start returning to the country this coming week. The US embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for the moment.\n\nBlinken said Biden in the coming days planned to nominate the current US ambassador to Slovakia, Bridget Brink, as the new ambassador to Kyiv, a post that has been officially empty since 2019.\n\nThough several European countries have already reopened their embassies in Kyiv, the return will be gradual for American diplomats, according to a State Department official.\n\n"Since the start of hostilities, we\'ve had a team across the border in Poland who\'s been handling this work for us," the official told reporters waiting for Blinken and Austin on the Polish side of the border.\n\n"Starting this week, members of that team will be able to do day trips instead into Ukraine," he said.

The next day, EU leaders gathered for an extraordinary summit. At that time, they thought the war would only last a few days…\n\nThis seems like ancient history now.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to EU leaders at that summit via video link. Shortly after, the author of this Brief met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who said leaders reeled in shock because Zelenskyy’s video call seemed like a final goodbye.\n\n“One shudders because this man who is asking for help and support may not be alive in the next 48 hours”, Petkov said.\n\nSince then, it has become apparent that the Russian army was not as efficient as we thought, and Ukrainian resistance is not only heroic but potent.\n\nArms started to arrive in Ukraine, Kyiv became safe enough to receive visits from foreign officials, and Zelenskyy addressed parliaments across the world.\n\nRussia re-hashed its strategy, abandoning plans for total dominance via a puppet government and concentrating on territories in the east and south of Ukraine that it still hopes to capture and retain.\n\nChances for a ceasefire are linked with a scenario in which one of the two sides is close to capitulation. But as long as both sides harbour other ambitions – Ukraine to regain most of its territory and Russia to obtain full access to the Black Sea – it is unrealistic to imagine a peace agreement.\n\nBesides, the West now looks set to offer Ukraine whatever weapons it needs, while Russia has no other option but to fight because a defeat is simply not an option for President Vladimir Putin. The main risk factor remains that Putin might be tempted to use arms of mass destruction at some point.\n\nBut if this war remains conventional, as we hope, it is safe to assume that it may last a very long time. And if this is the case, we must concede the war will transform Europe and possibly the world.\n\nThe EU was blind to internal developments in Russia during the run-up to the war, which sought to restore “the glory” of the USSR by force.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU remains over-dependent on Russian oil and gas and vulnerable to Russian propaganda and policy of sowing divisions.\n\nIn hindsight, we can say that the most naïve country was Germany, perceived until recently as our Union’s leader. Conversely, perhaps the most alert country was Poland, who has been fighting a rule-of-law war with the European Commission – a dispute that looks rather unhelpful in the current context.\n\nWhen Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in 2019 that she had ambitions to lead a ‘geopolitical Commission’, she could not know that she would have no other choice three years on. EU policies are changing, taboos are disappearing, and bureaucrats are being pushed out of their comfort zone.\n\nIf, for example, the EU cannot reach an agreement on sanctioning the oil imports from Russia, it should abandon the unanimity rule, which serves nobody else but Putin. This would also significantly reduce the power of nuisance leaders like Viktor Orban.\n\nIt should be up to the Commission to make sure that detractors are excluded from specific funding and opportunities. This is part of building the EU’s resilience.\n\nWhile the war drags on, it is safe to bet that the EU will change more than it has done in decades.\n\nIt is good for Europe that the French President Emmanuel Macron has won a second mandate and that in Slovenia, Eurosceptic Janez Janša was badly beaten.\n\nIf the mainstream politicians take the social challenges in their countries seriously, the far-right politicians, who have already lost Putin as an icon, will be squeezed into the corner.\n\nEuropeans are capable of solidarity and will show the best of themselves and perhaps Europe will have a new generation of war leaders, as it did after World War II.\n\nThe Roundup\n\nWith the ongoing French EU Council presidency and the upcoming parliamentary elections, Emmanuel Macron will enjoy no grace period in his second mandate and the opposition, both on the left and the right, is more determined than ever to strip the newly re-elected president of his parliamentary majority.\n\nTwitter Inc is nearing a deal to sell itself to Elon Musk for $54.20 per share in cash, the price that he originally offered to the social media company and called his ‘best and final’, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIf you want to read up on how Slovenia fared in its parliamentary election on Sunday, we’ve got you covered: Conservatives are out, a progressive government is in.\n\nEurope’s market for hydrogen-powered taxis is becoming increasingly competitive, with French company Hype, which has developed them in Paris since 2015, being among the frontrunners.\n\nThe EU and India are set to announce closer cooperation and an imminent relaunch of negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement on Monday, as part of Western efforts to help decrease the world’s second-most populous country’s dependence on Russia.\n\nLook out for…\n\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee holds public hearing on encouraging engagement of young people towards achieving sustainable development.\n\nCouncil of Europe holds conference on ‘Speaking Human Rights Online’.\n\nViews are the author’s.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Shared-Link-The-Hub-Article-Templates-Options-44-800x450.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:09'}

Biden and other NATO heads of state were quick to congratulate the French leader on Twitter, as many feared the implications of nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen defeating Macron. As it turned out, the incumbent beat his Eurosceptic rival handily, by a margin of 58.5% to 41.5%.\n\n“Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his re-election,” Biden tweeted on Sunday. “France is our oldest ally and a key partner in addressing global challenges.

The two leaders haven’t seen completely eye-to-eye on responding to Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine. Macron has called for dialogue with Moscow to help bring peace, and he has chosen not to follow his US counterpart and other NATO leaders in branding Putin a “war criminal” and accusing Russian forces of committing “genocide.” In fact, he suggested earlier this month that such rhetoric isn’t conducive to ending the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“Genocide has a meaning,” Macron said. “The Ukrainian people and Russian people are brotherly people. It’s madness what’s happening today. It’s unbelievable brutality and a return to war in Europe. But at the same time, I look at the facts, and I want to continue to try the utmost to be able to stop the war and restore peace. I’m not sure if the escalation of words serves our cause.”\n\nLate last month, after Biden called Putin a “butcher” and said he “cannot remain in power,” Macron countered that leaders must use restraint in speaking about the crisis. “We want to stop the war that Russia has launched in Ukraine without escalation – that’s the objective,” Macron said. “If this is what we want to do, we should not escalate things – neither with words nor actions.”\n\nThe two leaders also clashed last year, such as when Macron admonished Biden for “abandoning” pro-Western allies in Afghanistan and argued that the countries had a “moral responsibility” toward the Afghan people – remarks that were scrubbed from a White House summary of the conversation. Macron’s administration last September recalled its ambassador to Washington and accused Biden of behaving like Trump after Washington partnered with the UK to persuade Australia to scrap a submarine deal with France and instead buy their vessels.\n\nWhite House calls to foreign leaders are typically arranged by staffers to avoid unscripted moments or gaffes.

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:51'}

Here’s today’s news.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – FIGHTING\n\nRussia has made small advances after beginning to focus on the full occupation of the Donbas region, but the lack of resources and combat support is making it hard for the Russian troops to occupy the region, the U.K. Defense Ministry has said in an intelligence update. Russia’s Ministry of Defense has proposed that the military handle payments to families of deceased soldiers, suggesting that Russia is trying to hide the extensive war losses from its own population, the update added. Ayumi Fujimoto reports for NBC News.\n\nFive train stations in central and western Ukraine came under Russian fire this morning, delaying train services, Oleksandr Kamyshim chairman of Ukrainian Railways said in a Telegram post. Julian Duplain reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussia has said that it would investigate the cause of a large fire that erupted in the early hours of the morning at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk 96 miles northeast of the border with Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement that the fire had broken out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 0200 local time (1800 EST) and that there had been no need to evacuate any parts of Bryansk, a city of 400,000 people. Reuters reports.\n\nNine Russian missiles struck infrastructure in Kremenchuk, an industrial city in central Ukraine, yesterday according to a regional leader. “The enemy does not shy away from anything, even on such a holy day,” Dmytro Lunin, an acting governor and head of the Poltava region’s military administration, wrote on Telegram. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRussian attacks targeting the towns of Gorske and Zolote in the eastern Luhansk region killed six people on Saturday, the region’s governor, Sergiy Haida has said. Cora Engelbrecht reports for the New York Times.\n\nA series of artillery strikes hit central and east Kharkiv on Saturday, including a large residential area. There were no casualties in the strike on central Kharkiv, officials said. Thomas Gibbons-Neff reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussia is planning a staged referendum in the Ukrainian city of Kherson to justify “its occupation,” according to the U.K.’s Defense Ministry. “The city is key to Russia’s objective of establishing a land bridge to Crimea and dominating southern Ukraine,” the ministry tweeted in an intelligence update. María Paúl reports for the Washington Post.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – MARIUPOL\n\nUkrainian forces are still in full control of the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol and have repelled continuous assaults by Russian infantry, Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Battalion, said yesterday. Ukrainian forces are willing to leave the factory and evacuate the city if given guarantees of safe passage for themselves and hundreds of civilians, Palamar said. Michael Schwirtz reports for the New York Times.\n\nRussian troops may be preparing for a renewed assault on the Azovstal steel plant, according to an update by Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War. BBC News reports.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross issued a statement yesterday saying that it was “deeply alarmed” by the situation in Mariupol.

Marc Santora and Austin Ramzy report for the New York Times.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – U.S. RESPONSE\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said during an unannounced trip to Kyiv on Sunday that U.S. diplomats would return to Ukraine this week. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to the Ukrainian capital, where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials, making them the highest-level US officials to have traveled to the country since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hanlser report for CNN.\n\nBridget Brink, who is currently the ambassador to Slovakia, is expected to be named as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine – a position that has been left vacant since early 2020 under former President Trump’s administration. President Joe Biden will likely nominate her later today. María Paúl and Missy Ryan report for the Washington Post.\n\nAt the meeting in Kyiv, the U.S. pledged more than $700m in military financing to help Ukraine’s war efforts, officials have said. About half of the money will go to Ukraine, while the rest will be split among NATO members and other regional allies. In addition, the US will sell $165m of ammunition to Ukraine. BBC News reports.\n\nRussia is failing in its war aims but Ukraine is succeeding, Blinken said following his and Austin’s meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Reuters reports.\n\nThe United States hopes the war in Ukraine will result in a “weakened” Russia that no longer has the capacity to invade its neighbors, Austin told reporters during his trip to Kyiv. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said. Annabelle Timsit and Julie Yoon report for the Washington Post.\n\nZelenskyy has thanked the US for its “unprecedented” support for Ukraine, following his meeting with Blinken and Austin yesterday. “We appreciate the unprecedented assistance of the United States to Ukraine. I would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, for his personal clear position. To thank all the American people, as well as the Congress for their bicameral and bipartisan support. We see it. We feel it,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukraine’s presidential website reports.\n\nAlina Kabaeva, the woman the U.S. government believes to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend, has been spared sanctions in a last-minute decision. U.S. officials believe that sanctioning Kabaeva would be deemed so personal a blow to Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the U.S.. Vivian Salama, Joe Parkinson and Drew Hinshaw report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMultiple governors have announced that their state National Guards would be sending armored vehicles to Ukraine in response to a request from the Pentagon. Gov. Mike DeWine (R- OH) and Gov. Jim Justice (R – WV) announced that their state National Guards would be providing an unspecified number of M-113 armored personnel carriers, which help move equipment and soldiers “while providing protection from small arms fire and the effects of artillery,” according to press releases from both governors’ offices. Caroline Vakil reports for The Hill.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – GLOBAL RESPONSE\n\nIn recent days Russian authorities have stopped publishing data on government debt, trade statistics and oil production, while lawmakers work on a bill banning lenders from sharing data with foreign states. The growing blackout is part of an effort by the Russian authorities to protect the economy and domestic companies from further sanctions by the West. Limited data means that Washington and Brussels will have less visibility on whether and how their sanctions are working. Georgi Kantchev reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTop Ukrainian officials yesterday expressed disapproval of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of the officer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told NBC in an interview that Guterres is “not really” authorized to speak on behalf of the Ukrainian government. Quint Forget reports for POLITICO.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE – OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\n\nRussia has proposed the forced donation of blood by captured Ukrainian soldiers, according to Ukrainian ombudsperson for Human Rights, Lyudmila Denisova. “This fact testifies to the analogy of the atrocities of the Nazis in the concentration camps during the Second World War,” she said in a post on Facebook. Aaron Reich reports for the Jerusalem Post.\n\nGreenpeace activists have sought to block a tanker from delivering Russian oil to Norway, chaining themselves to the vessel in a protest against the war in Ukraine. As of this morning, the Ust Luga product tanker is anchored outside Exxon Mobil’s Slagen oil terminal some 43 miles south of the capital Oslo, according to the vessel tracker Marine Traffic. “Oil is not only at the root of the climate crisis but also of wars and conflicts. I am shocked that Norway operates as a free port for Russian oil, which we know finances Putin’s warfare,” Greenpeace Norway head Frode Pleym said. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine’s postal service has said it was targeted by a cyberattack on Friday following to sale of stamps portraying a Ukrainian soldier making a crude gesture to a Russian warship. Reuters reports.\n\nUkraine has asked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a list of equipment that is necessary for the reliable and safe operation of its nuclear facilities during the war. The list specifically mentions radiation measuring instruments, shielding materials, electrical power systems and diesel generators. The IAEA reports.\n\nOTHER U.S. RELATIONS\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said yesterday that the current scale of espionage and cybersecurity threats from China were “unprecedented in history.” He noted that China’s hacking program is larger “than that of every other major nation combined,” adding that China’s targets span nearly every sector of the economy. Monique Balls reports for The Hill.\n\nThe Chinese government is not only mistreating Uyghurs within China’s borders, it is hunting them down abroad with help from countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, according to a new report by the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S.. More than 5,500 Uyghurs outside of China have been targeted by Beijing, hit with cyberattacks and threats to family members who remain in China, and more than 1,500 Uyghurs have been detained or forced to return to China to face imprisonment and torture in police custody, according to the report. Anna Schecter reports for NBC News.\n\nPresident Biden yesterday issued a statement memorializing the Armenian genocide. “Let us redouble our efforts toward healing and building the better, more peaceful world that we wish for our children … A world where human rights are respected, where the evils of bigotry and intolerance do not mark our daily lives, and where people everywhere are free to pursue their lives in dignity and security,” the statement said. David Cohen reports for POLITICO.\n\nOTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nEmmanuel Macron won a second term as president of France yesterday, triumphing over his far-right challenger, Marine Le Pen. Projections at the close of voting, which are generally reliable, showed Macron gaining 58.5 per cent of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5 per cent. His victory was much narrower than in 2017 when the margin was 66.1 per cent to 33.9 per cent for Le Pen. Roger Cohen reports for the New York Times.\n\nPreliminary results for Slovenia’s parliamentary elections show that right-wing Prime Minister Janez Jansa has lost to centrist rivals. With 95 per cent of the vote counted, results indicated that Jansa’s Slovenian Democratic Party had won around 24 per cent of the vote. That is far behind the 34 per cent of its main rival, the centrist Freedom Movement, meaning that Jansa is highly unlikely to keep his post as prime minister. Andrew Higgins reports for the New York Times.\n\nIsrael yesterday closed its civilian border crossing with the Gaza Strip, preventing thousands of Gazans from getting to work in Israel, in an effort to pressure Gaza’s ruler Hamas to halt rocket attacks against southern Israel.

Dov Lieber reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHundreds of Arab militia fighters, attacked a village in Sudan’s western Darfur region yesterday, torching homes and shops and killing at least 150 people, according to aid groups and U.N. officials.

Declan Walsh reports for the New York Times.\n\nBritish man, Luke Symons, who was held captive in Yemen without charge or trial for five years has been released from jail. U.K. foreign secretary, Liz Truss, confirmed yesterday that Symons “would shortly be reunited with his family.” She thanked Omani and Saudi negotiators as well as U.K. Foreign Office staff as he was released alongside 13 other foreign nationals in Yemen. Joe Middleton reports for the Guardian.\n\nThree policemen were killed in central Nigeria’s Kogi state on Saturday after gunmen stormed a police station in an attack claimed by Islamic State. The attack came a day after explosives planted at a bar in northeast Nigeria injured 11 people. Anna MacSwan reports for the Guardian.\n\nHealth authorities in the Democratic Republic and Congo have declared a new outbreak of Ebola, the Work Health organisation reported yesterday. So far, just one case has been confirmed and investigations to determine the source of the outbreak are ongoing. U.N. News Centre reports.\n\nSaudi princes have sold more than $600 million worth of real estate, yachts and artwork in the U.S. and Europe since the kingdom’s de facto ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman tightened the purse strings of the ultrawealthy ruling family. The transactions represent a radical change of fortune for senior princes who funnelled windfalls from oil booms in the 1970s and 1980s into some of the world’s most exclusive markets. “They’ve clearly been cut down to a disciplined, defined regimen and are having to live on that,” said British historian Robert Lacey, who has chronicled the Saudi ruling family since the 1980s. Prince Mohammed is “here for the long term and he’s reshaping things in a long-term fashion.” Stephen Kalin reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nJAN. 6, 2021 ATTACK\n\nRep.

Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck report for CNN.\n\nOTHER DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS\n\nTwitter Inc. is in discussions to sell itself to Elon Musk and could finalize a deal as soon as this week. The two sides met Sunday to discuss Musk’s proposal and were making progress, according to sources familiar with the matter. However, there is no guarantee they will reach a deal. Cara Lombardo and Dana Cimilluca report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nA U.S. Air Force general officer has been found guilty of abusive sexual contact, in the first-ever court-martial trial and conviction of a general officer in the history of the military branch. Maj. Gen. William T. Cooley was found guilty on one of three specifications of sexual assault connected to a 2018 incident in New Mexico, the Air Force said in a statement. Aaron Pellish reports for CNN.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments today in the case of Joseph Kennedy – a Washington state high school football coach who lost his job after he refused to stop praying on the field immediately after games. “There is good reason to think that its newly expanded conservative majority will not only rule in Kennedy’s favor but also make a major statement about the role religion may play in public life,” Adam Liptak reports for the New York Times.\n\nThis morning a judge will consider whether to hold former President Trump in contempt for violating a court order that he comply with a subpoena regarding a civil investigation into his business practices. New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is asking a state court judge to fine Trump $10,000 for each day that he has failed to turn over documents relevant to the subpoena. Harper Neidig reports for The Hill.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray yesterday highlighted an increase in violence against police officers last year, including a jump in police murders. “Violence against law enforcement in this country is one of the biggest phenomena that I think doesn’t get enough attention,” Wray said in an interview, adding that in 2021, “officers were being killed at a rate of almost one every five days.” Monique Beals reports for The Hill.\n\nA Colorado man who set himself on fire in front of the Supreme Court on Friday in an apparent Earth Day protest against climate change has died.

In addition, Blinken and Austin have announced the provision of more than $700 million in additional direct and indirect military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAt the heart of their talks with President, Volodymyr Zelensky was Kyiv\'s demand for heavier weapons to stop the Russian offensive in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe $713 million aid will be distributed between Ukraine and 15 other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. About $322 million is for Kyiv. The rest are allies who have sent aid to Ukraine since the start of the war to get the weapons they need.\n\nThe total amount of military supplies from the United States to Ukraine reached 3.7 billion dollars.\n\n"We do not know how the war will develop from now on, but we know that the existence of a sovereign, independent Ukraine will last much longer than the presence of Vladimir Putin. We will continue to support Ukraine until final success is achieved," said Antony Blinken at a press conference after the visit, adding that it is an expression of American support for the leadership of Ukraine. He added that he had talked with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will visit Moscow and Kyiv this week, to convey a strong message to President Putin to end the war, a truce to be achieved and the evacuation of civilians from dangerous areas to finally occur.\n\nMoscow, for its part, has sent a note to Washington calling for an end to US arms supplies to Ukraine, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said.\n\n"Have we served a note - yes, we have emphasized that it is an unacceptable situation in which the United States is filling Ukraine with weapons," he said, adding that Russia had called for an end to the practice.\n\nBlinken and Austin are the first US government officials to visit Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The war, which entered its third month, killed thousands and killed 5,500 refugees. Kyiv is also seeking help for Ukrainians stranded in the ruined city of Mariupol. According to the mayor, more than 100,000 people are still there and cannot be evacuated. Ukraine\'s defense in Mariupol is on the verge of collapse, admitted Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to President Zelensky. He also said that high-ranking US officials would not have come to Kyiv if "they were not ready to give up weapons".\n\nEarlier, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said that Russian troops not only did not respond to calls for a ceasefire but also prevented the population from leaving Mariupol and seeking refuge in the interior of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the ceasefire, Kyiv insists on safe and several-day humanitarian corridors for civilians who want to leave Mariupol and go to Kyiv-controlled territories. Authorities in Kyiv will also demand the release or exchange of their fighters, who are still trapped at the Azovstal plant.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Zelensky spoke with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to mediate a truce in Mariupol. Turkey views "in principle positively" the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine after the end of the war with Russia. This was stated in a statement issued by the presidential institution in Ankara after Erdogan\'s telephone conversation with Zelensky. Ukraine is pushing for collective security guarantees in exchange for its refusal to join NATO, pushed by Russian demands.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his re-election and said the French president was a "true friend of Ukraine".\n\n"Congratulations to the president and true friend Emmanuel Macron on his election victory," Zelensky wrote on his Twitter account earlier this morning.\n\nMacron is seeking a diplomatic solution to halt the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

It’s not my thing.”\n\nSPD co-president Saskia Esken was asked in an interview with state radio whether Schroeder should quit the party.\n\n“I think he should,” she replied. The party was currently examining 14 motions to have its former leader expelled, she told journalists later, adding that the final decision would come down to the party’s arbitration body.\n\nBut she also told journalists: “He makes his money working for Russian state businesses… Gerhard Schroeder has for many years been a businessman, and we should stop seeing him as a former honourable leader, a former chancellor.”\n\nThomas Kutschaty, another senior party figure, was equally scathing.\n\n“He has to choose,” he told Welt TV. “Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.\n\nFRANCE 24’s Joseph Keen reports:\n\n01:21\n\n03:10am: Britain to lift all tariffs on Ukrainian imports\n\nAll tariffs on goods coming to Britain from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed to help the Ukrainian economy, the British government announced on Monday.\n\nLondon said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.\n\n“We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation,” said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.\n\nBritain said currently the average tariff on Ukrainian imports was about 22 percent. It said the planned change had been offered on a non-reciprocal basis, but Kyiv was likely to match the British action.\n\nAdditionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.\n\n01:59am: US hosts Ukraine talks in Germany as war enters critical phase\n\nThe United States will host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries on Tuesday for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv so it can defend against an unfolding and potentially decisive Russian onslaught in the east, US officials said.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war effort.\n\nUS Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.\n\n“The next several weeks will be very, very critical,” Milley told reporters travelling with him. “They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.”\n\nApril 26, 12:17am: Russia says NATO engaging in ‘proxy’ war in Ukraine, arms shipments legitimate targets\n\nDeliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.\n\n“These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry’s website.\n\n“Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.”\n\n11:34pm: US Senate leader expects ‘swift’ action on next round of military funding to Ukraine\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he expected “swift, bipartisan” passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request.\n\nWhile Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, “We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression” and “I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.”\n\n11:25pm: UK says Russian invasion likely to cut Ukraine’s grain harvest by 20 percent this year\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly disrupted Ukrainian agricultural production, the UK’s ministry of defence tweeted in a regular bulletin on Monday.\n\n“Ukrainian grain harvest for 2022 is likely to be around 20% lower than 2021 due to reduced sowing areas following invasion,” it said.\n\nThe reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain, British military intelligence said.\n\nLatest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine -

They have declared that the friendship between them has \'no limits\'... What can we expect from the \'new international relations\' that both have called for?"\n\nVon der Leyen\'s trip to New Delhi follows several recent overtures from high-profile diplomatic guests seeking to lure India away from Russia.\n\n3:32pm: Russia expels 40 German diplomats\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had declared 40 German diplomatic staff "personae non gratae" in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it had taken the decision after Germany on April 4 declared a "significant number" of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin "undesirable".\n\nGermany announced the expulsion of 40 Russian diplomats on April 4 following mounting evidence of civilian killings and mass graves in Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\n3:06pm: Another 45,000 people escape Ukraine amid war\n\nMore than 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, with over 45,000 joining their ranks in the past 24 hours, the United Nations said Monday.\n\nIn total, 5,232,014 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n\nThat marks an increase of 45,270 over Sunday’s figure.\n\nThe outflow has slowed since the start of the war.

Had Marine Le Pen, known for her sympathies for the Russian leader, won this might not have been the case.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Marine Le Pen had EU and NATO leaders on edge after stating her intention to pull Paris out of the alliance\'s military command.\n\nThey were also concerns about her approach to the EU, which would have meant an increasing role of the nation-state, something which runs counter to the EU\'s founding principles.\n\nMacron, however is a strong supporter of increased EU integration and has made a case for a common defence strategy, something he started promoting vigourously after he was elected president for the first time in 2017.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study by the think-tank Carnegie Europe, "Macron’s main military objective is to enable Europeans to act autonomously when needed, complementing NATO’s territorial defence role with a European capacity to intervene abroad".\n\nThis would build on existing initiatives like the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation.\n\nRussia\'s look at Macron\'s victory\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, analyst Andrey Kudryavtsev, a senior researcher at IMEMO, a think tank affiliated with Russia\'s Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Izvestia news agency as saying that Macron\'s victory "means that France\'s foreign policy will be about the same as it has been for the previous five years".\n\nHe pointed out that his main priority is the "strategic autonomy and strengthening of the European Union" so that the EU "becomes one of the key centres of the world system."\n\nPutin himself on Monday sent Macron a message to congratulate him with his re-election, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n"I sincerely wish you success in your activities, as well as good health and well-being," he was quoted as saying.\n\nA stronger Europe\n\nDuring his first tenure as president, which coincided with US President Donald Trump\'s NATO-sceptical presidency, Macron was often critical of the trans-Atlantic alliance, even going so far as to call it "brain dead" during an interview in 2019.\n\nBut Russia\'s invasion of the Ukraine and the more NATO-friendly approach of Trump\'s successor, Joe Biden, changed everything.\n\n“The war launched by [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin brings a clarification, and creates at our borders and on our European soil an unusual threat which gives a strategic clarification to NATO,” the French President said in during a press conference last March.\n\nAt the same time, he reinforced the idea that Europe should strengthen its own defences.\n\n"I continue to think that we need to rebuild a new European order of security. The war today in Ukraine makes it even more indispensable," he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron was one of the rare EU leaders who went on talking to Putin, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) in Moscow on February 7, 2022, for talks in an effort to find common ground on Ukraine and NATO, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy over fears Russia is preparing an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. AFP - -\n\nDuring his last live interview before the elections Macron warned radio station FranceInter against choosing a military path against Russia, saying that a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which could start “a new world war.”\n\nHe said that France and Germany had decided not to directly interfere in the war, but did send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nMacron also said he does “not rule out at all” talking with the Russian president.\n\nStopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would yield the initiative for negotiations to others like “Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] or Chinese president [Xi Jinping].”\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nOn the economic front, France - and its fellow EU member states - are starting to feel the fallout of the war. Food prices are up, edible oil is disappearing from supermarkets.\n\n"We are already see rising food prices. Not only because of Ukraine, but also because of Russia," Vasili Astrov, senior economist of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies told RFI.\n\n"The disruptions in supply of Russian grain are not so much because of the war, but because of the export embargo which has been enacted in Russia in order to prevent the rise in domestic prices.\n\nIt means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else. PODCAST: Vasili Astrov - Senior Economist Vienna Institute talking about the economic impact of the war on Ukraine, the EU and Russia.\n\n"In addition to rising food prices, we see rising energy prices and that will affect economic growth throughout EU, because it means people will have to pay more for food and energy and there will be less money to be spent on anything else.\n\n"There is talk about a potential new version of a Marshal Plan for Ukraine, a massive assistance package by the US and the EU, which would help reconstruct areas affected by the war," which newly elected French president Macron will be more likely to support, together with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz.\n\n"That would be the only feasible scenario for Ukraine and the only way it could really pull itself out of the current economic crisis, because Ukraine doesn\'t have many fiscal resources of its own.\n\nBut setting up an effective Marshall Plan takes time, and will be only a short-term solution, says Astrov. Crucial for rebuilding Ukraine will be the return of investment.\n\nBut return of private investors will take even more time, he thinks. On average, he says, countries emerging from a war have to wait some "five years before private investors return."\n\n"GDP level of Portugal"\n\nRussia won\'t be able to count on any Western help. While not all foreign companies got out of Russia (French supermarket giant Auchan remained loyal to its Russian customers for one), the country may be in dire straits for years to come.\n\nMost foreign companies "basically closed down their operations" in Russia, almost all western car manufacturers have withdrawn, while it is "clear that the climate for foreign investment will remain toxic," making it increasingly difficult for Moscow to gain access to advanced technology.\n\nRussia will still be able to avoid complete isolation because there will be "more economic cooperation with China" and other BRICS countries such as Brazil and India, as well as Indonesia.\n\nHowever, this will never be "fully substitute the disruption of economic links with the West," leaving it economically far behind, even below the GDP level of Portugal.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe', 'image': 'https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/26154f5e-c40f-11ec-98b7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-04-24T203700Z_74009166_UP1EI4O1L9N51_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.JPG', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:51'}

It didn’t name the suspects or provide evidence to support the allegations. It said some of the suspects were held as captives, without specifying where, while other charges were being prepared in absentia.\n\nUkraine says it is investigating some 7,600 potential war crimes and at least 500 suspects following Russia\'s Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told Reuters that many of those suspects are in Russia but some have been taken captive by Ukraine as prisoners of war. Speaking in an interview earlier this month, she said that her office intends to follow the chain of command up the Russian political and military hierarchy.\n\nVenediktova added that she plans to pursue prosecutions both in Ukrainian courts as well as at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, the world’s permanent war crimes tribunal.\n\nThe Kremlin and Russia’s defence ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment. Moscow has rejected allegations by Ukraine and Western nations of war crimes and has denied targeting civilians in what the Kremlin calls a "special military operation" to demilitarise its neighbour.\n\nUkraine’s probe is at the centre of multiple efforts to investigate potential war crimes related to the conflict, including by the ICC. The probes are at the very early stages, people familiar with them say. The ICC has sent an advance team to the region to establish operations. read more\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of genocide against Russian speakers, which Kyiv strongly denies. Russia has also opened criminal cases into Ukrainian servicemen\'s alleged torture of their Russian counterparts. read more\n\nUkraine, which is conducting its investigation while still in the throes of war, is scrambling to assemble teams of specialists with war crimes expertise, evaluating potential crimes and developing its prosecution strategy.\n\n”You can see they are now exhuming the bodies, so [the investigation is at a] very early stage," a person familiar with the process said. In terms of strategy, Kyiv plans to prosecute as much as it can in Ukrainian courts but would likely leave any cases involving higher-ranking figures to the ICC, the person added.\n\nThe UN has also established its own inquiry into possible violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine, including possible war crimes, which could feed into any prosecutions by the ICC.\n\nThere is also a European Union-coordinated effort to fast track sharing of evidence between various investigating authorities, including with the ICC. Several European countries have said they will apply universal jurisdiction, the legal principle that some crimes are so terrible they can be heard by foreign national courts, and their prosecutors could launch investigations into Ukrainian atrocities.\n\nFor Ukraine, the immediate challenge is the sheer volume of potential evidence and witness testimony that needs to be secured and recorded in a way that is usable in court, legal specialists say. That includes vast amounts of digital imagery as well as material gathered on the ground.\n\nDavid Schwendiman, a former U.S. federal prosecutor who has also helped prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan wars in the 1990s, praised Ukraine’s prosecutor general as talented and courageous but said the country doesn’t have experience of an investigation of this scale and will need outside help processing potential crime scenes in a way that meets international standards.\n\n“Every one of those bodies is a crime scene. Every one of those buildings is a crime scene. Every city is a crime scene,” Schwendiman said. Something as small as a piece of cloth torn from a uniform, an ammunition shell or even a ligature used to tie someone’s hands could help identify a particular unit involved and so needs to be carefully preserved, he added.\n\nZera Kozlyieva, deputy head of the war crimes unit in the prosecutor general’s office, acknowledged that limited access due to ongoing hostilities and a shortage of war crimes specialists presented challenges. Speaking Thursday on a panel at international affairs think tank Chatham House, she said that Kyiv is seeking help from international experts.\n\nImages of dead civilians in Ukraine, including of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, have prompted international outrage, with U.S. President Joe Biden calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be investigated for war crimes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused invading Russian troops of committing "the most terrible war crimes" since World War Two.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, as of April 22 more than 2,400 civilians had been killed since the conflict began in late February. But the official count is likely to climb. In the port city of Mariupol alone, local authorities have said thousands of people have been killed. read more\n\nUnder international law, war crimes include intentionally targeting civilian populations, willfully killing or causing suffering, and widespread destruction among other serious violations of laws applicable in armed conflict. Individuals who commit such crimes can be prosecuted by international tribunals such as the ICC and by states.\n\nExperts for the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) nations said in a report published earlier this month that they found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia in Ukraine. The experts also said in the report that they’d found evidence of violations of international humanitarian law by Ukraine, particularly in its treatment of prisoners of war, but that Russia\'s violations "are by far larger in nature and scale."\n\nUkraine has said it checks all information regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action. Russia has said the report "is based solely on unfounded propaganda theses, contains references to dubious sources and logical stretches in the style of \'highly likely.\'"\n\nUKRAINE’S PROBE\n\nThe prosecutor general’s office had in recent years established a special unit to investigate potential crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 but Kyiv continues to claim as part of Ukraine, and Donbas.\n\nMoscow’s February invasion of its Western neighbour forced Kyiv to scale up what had been a relatively small team of prosecutors.\n\nVenediktova and her team have in recent weeks been evaluating sites where atrocities have taken place, including where Russian troops have recently withdrawn.\n\nOn April 12, Venediktova visited Bucha, near Kyiv, where French forensic experts had arrived to help Ukraine authorities establish what happened in the town where hundreds of bodies have been discovered. As the group from the French Gendarmerie\'s forensic science department looked on, workers in hazmat suits dug earth from a shallow grave and lifted out a heavy mass wrapped in an orange blanket. Citing witnesses, Venediktova said during the visit that the burnt body parts inside were those of a woman and her two children. read more\n\nRussia has said that images and footage of dead bodies strewn across Bucha were fake.\n\nVenediktova is also drawing on international legal expertise and seeking technical assistance. She has announced the formation of a task force of law firms and prominent international human rights lawyers, including Amal Clooney, to advise on securing accountability for Ukrainian victims in national jurisdictions as well as strategic guidance on cooperating with the ICC.\n\nVenediktova is in regular contact with Beth Van Schaack, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice in the U.S. State Department, who said the two have discussed what additional assistance Washington could provide. Van Schaack’s office has been helping to deploy specialists on the ground via a joint U.S.-European project.\n\nVan Schaack told Reuters that Venediktova’s requests for assistance include forensics expertise, such as helping determine how victims found in mass graves died and whether potential signs of torture were inflicted prior to death. Other requests include help identifying the type and origins of particular ballistics used as well as assistance clearing any mines left by Russians so that her investigators can safely access those areas.\n\nUkraine’s potentially biggest challenge, said Van Schaack, will be gaining custody of suspects, particularly those higher up the command chain. If they remain in Russia, they may “enjoy impunity for the rest of their days,” she said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Anthony Deutsch in Amsterdam; additional reporting by Alessandra Prentice in Bucha, Pavel Polityuk in Kyiv, Max Hunder in London, Stephanie van den Berg in The Hague and Simon Lewis in Washington.

There are rumours that Brussels will impose an outright import ban. Others believe the sanctions will be lighter, consisting of new tariffs and a set phase-out date.\n\nThis lack of clarity stems largely from the political gap on the issue among member states. When it comes to an outright ban, Germany is still unconvinced (though its views seem to be evolving), while Hungary remains dead set against any embargo.\n\nThis contrasts with other EU countries who have shown significant willingness to cut off Russian oil, notably France. An emboldened President Emmanuel Macron, buoyed by his re-election on Sunday, is likely to push EU partners to embrace the concept with a renewed vigour.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to say what Brussels will ultimately announce, any sanctions on oil will almost certainly trigger further price shocks, which will be felt at the petrol pump and on the overall cost of living.\n\nLeaders have an unpalatable choice: stop funding Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine through oil imports and accept the economic hit or jettison the EU’s principles in the name of relative stability.\n\nIf a ban is announced, elevated fuel prices will compound the pain of the last months and are likely to foment further civil unrest (witness the mass protests against spiralling living costs that have engulfed Spain).\n\nTo soften the blow, governments may choose to keep petrol and diesel prices steady by doubling down on subsidies and price caps.\n\nThis is far from ideal. Not only is it essentially a subsidy for Putin until the ban is fully implemented, but it also prevents demand from dropping, thereby keeping prices high in real terms.\n\nIt additionally complicates government plans for carbon taxes and the expansion of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to road transport. Simultaneously subsidising oil to lower prices while taxing oil to push prices up makes little sense, whatever the original rationale behind both decisions.\n\nAnother option is to dust off the 1970s playbook and target the demand side.\n\nThose of a certain age may recall the oil shortage of the 1970s. In response to the crisis, then-US president Jimmy Carter encouraged Americans in a series of speeches to use less energy. Carter himself refused to turn on air conditioning in the White House and sold the presidential yacht as a symbolic act.\n\nHis message of energy restraint was not popular, and Carter was ejected from the White House after one term.\n\nIn 2022, European governments will likely hope they can convince citizens to change their habits by focusing on the positives of living a less energy-dependent lifestyle – lower costs, cleaner air, and better health.\n\nEnvironmentalists have been pushing such policies for years: higher levels of cycling, cheaper and more expansive public transport, a shift to car sharing, and lower speed limits.\n\nBut the reality is that telling citizens to drive less and use less energy is as likely to be unpopular today as it was some 50 years ago.\n\nWhatever the path taken, Europe’s reliance on fossil fuels – particularly from an unstable neighbour – must come to an end, both for geopolitical and climate reasons.\n\nRussia’s invasion has merely hastened Europe’s energy reckoning.\n\nToday’s edition is powered by Global Mobility Call.\n\n“Safe and Clean Road Transport.

All batteries produced for the vehicles will need to adhere to the requirements of the legislation.\n\nEURACTIV understands that France, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council until July, is keen to progress the file as quickly as possible.\n\nSeveral further trialogues are already scheduled, with the aim of having an agreement brokered before the summer break.\n\nTaxi operators turn to hydrogen to cut emissions\n\nMuch of the debate on the future of private road transport has come down to internal combustion engine cars vs electric vehicles.\n\nBut there is another option, which is proving popular among taxi fleet operators – hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nCities across Europe have seen a boost in the number of hydrogen-powered taxis, thanks in part to favourable legislation.\n\nThe Clean Hydrogen Partnership, a joint venture between the EU and industry, aims to roll out 180 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in Paris, London, and Copenhagen.\n\n“Hydrogen is the ideal fuel for taxis because of the long-range, intensive use and short recharging time,” said Clean Hydrogen Partnership CEO Bart Biebuyck.\n\nHydrogen-fuel cell vehicles have a similar range to internal combustion engine cars and can be refuelled in around five minutes.\n\nThe EU is supporting the Clean Hydrogen Partnership with €1 billion to accelerate the development of clean hydrogen applications.\n\nRead EURACTIV journalist Nelly Moussu’s full report below.\n\nEurope’s market for hydrogen-powered taxis is becoming increasingly competitive, with French company Hype, which has developed them in Paris since 2015, being among the frontrunners.\n\nThe European Union is preparing “smart sanctions” against Russian oil imports, The Times reported on Monday (25 April), citing the European Commission’s executive vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\nThe inclusion of natural gas in the European Commission’s proposal on low-carbon shipping fuels is incompatible with the recommendations of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), writes Faig Abbasov of Transport & Environment.\n\nThe EU’s promotion of biofuels as a renewable energy source is undermining the bloc’s climate goals, a new study by Princeton University academics and CIRAD, a French agricultural research body, has found.

It is the world’s first major carbon market and remains the biggest one.” The EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system, one of the two economically rational approaches to reducing carbon emissions (the other being a carbon tax). It is, in principle, exactly the right way to both deal with the long run and is flexible enough to be modified for near-term considerations.', 'image': 'https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DD16.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:17'}

Specifically, legislation such as CO 2 emission standards for cars & vans, which is currently being discussed in Brussels, will play a key role in paving this route.\n\nThe industrial, social and environmental challenge ahead of us is tremendous. Therefore, we cannot afford to put all our eggs into a single “electromobility basket,” but rather we should adopt a strategic approach by utilizing synergies between all solutions that are already on the table and ready to play their role.\n\nSuch a holistic approach should not blindly take engine technology into account alone, but rather fully integrate the aspect of fuels and energy, as fuels produced from various renewable sources will have an essential role to play in the transition.\n\nIn order to be fully future-proof and effectively lead to a transition towards emission-free transport, new vehicles will need to be clean, affordable to all, and immediately ready for use.\n\nIn the following, we want to discuss the requirements for a future proof car and discover why gas-powered vehicles would already tick all the boxes today:\n\nVehicles must be low emission and transitioning towards carbon neutrality\n\nWe must achieve the objective set out in the Paris Agreement for ensuring the global temperature increase remains well below 2°C while pursuing efforts to keep it to 1.5°C.

We are forgetting all emissions generated when producing fuel, or energy.\n\nCompressed natural gas (CNG) – powered cars, running on biomethane, have similar – or better – total emissions to those of an electric-powered vehicle when measuring the emissions on a combined Well-to-Wheel (WtW) and manufacturing emissions basis . Moreover, running a gas car on pure biomethane even enables negative WtW emissions, depending on the feedstock used to produce said biomethane.\n\nRenewable fuels and energy must be available and scalable\n\nTo harness the environmental benefits of all vehicles, renewably-produced fuels are key.\n\nThe quantity of biomethane which can be fuelled and used as bio-CNG vehicle fuel (and bio-LNG for trucks) is growing exponentially. To realize this, sustainable production pathways based on the circular economy are largely available.\n\nIn fact, more than a quarter of the gas used in road transport is already renewable. The European Commission further estimates that there will be at least 44 bcm/467 TWh of biogas and biomethane available in 2030; sufficient for the decarbonisation of all sectors.\n\nVehicle technology must be technologically mature, available and affordable\n\nIn order to achieve wide-scale customer acceptance and uptake, and thus benefit from the offered (environmental) advantages, such vehicles must be readily available, technologically mature, affordable, and easy to use.\n\nGas vehicles have been on the market for many years now and are widely available across the different market segments, while internal combustion engines (ICEs) are a highly developed technology for which Europe is the industrial leader.\n\nFuture proof vehicles must be able to be refuelled/recharged easily, rapidly, and anywhere\n\nCustomers want to fuel their vehicles anytime, anywhere, and in a timely manner.\n\nTherefore, when it comes to infrastructure, we must not only consider quantitative aspects, such as the existence of (or potential for) a robust, wide and geographically homogeneous fuelling station network. But also qualitative aspects such as the fact that road users must be familiar with the refuelling technology so that they can refuel easily and quickly.\n\nToday in 2022, the European gas refuelling infrastructure network consists of more than 4120 CNG (and 420 LNG) stations for which a significant amount of biomethane is already available.\n\nAt the same time, fuelling a CNG-powered vehicle is as easy, fast and safe as fuelling a petrol (or diesel) vehicle. Millions of consumers trust this solution already.\n\nNot only about vehicles: fuel sources must be local and renewable\n\nProducing fuels and vehicles locally will not only grant independence over strategic economic sectors, but also create jobs and boost innovation. Navigant’s study ‘Job creation by scaling up renewable gas in Europe’ already concluded in 2020 that the production of biomethane alone can create about 1 million direct and indirect jobs in Europe by 2050, which will empower new business opportunities for start-ups, SMEs, large companies and citizens alike.\n\nThe fulfilment of this prediction is accelerated by the recent proposal of the European Commission to scale up biomethane production to 35bcm by 2030 and to boost the production of renewable hydrogen in Europe.\n\nWith its proposal to revise the CO 2 emission standards for cars & vans, the European Commission set a high level of ambition to decarbonise the European vehicle fleet. Yet, by adhering to a pure tailpipe approach to measure GHG emission reductions, this proposal fails to establish a much-needed holistic framework to decarbonise road transport and seemingly incentivises electrification as the only way forward.\n\nCrucially, this overlooks the fact that biomethane can enable zero carbon solutions for large parts of the transport fleet. Vehicles powered by low carbon bioCNG (and bioLNG) are widely available, affordable, proven in operation and ready to play their role.\n\nIn order to achieve rapid and considerable GHG emission reductions at a reasonable cost, all transport solutions will be needed, including the further uptake of renewable fuels such as biomethane, an undertaking that can be realized—for example—through the inclusion of a voluntary crediting system.', 'image': 'https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/NGVA-Europe-article-for-April-25-1-800x450.jpg', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:12'}

We did the same with respect to the republics of the Donbass,” Putin said, adding that the republics subsequently asked Moscow for military assistance – which Russia provided in full compliance with the UN Charter.\n\nApart from discussing the international law and legal basis for Russia’s military operation, Putin and Guterres talked about the humanitarian situation on the ground in Ukraine. The UN chief said the organization and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were ready to provide assistance in evacuating civilians said to be trapped together with the Ukrainian fighters at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the city of Mariupol.\n\n“This will be an operation to evacuate civilians from the plant. Russia has been repeatedly blamed for that evacuation not being carried out. On the other hand, Russia has announced the creation of [humanitarian] corridors, which, however, are not being used,” Guterres stated.\n\nRussia’s president said the civilians purportedly trapped at the Azovstal plant remain there only because the Ukrainian fighters, including the neo-Nazi groups, that are holed up at the facility would not let them go.\n\n“We keep hearing from the Ukrainian authorities that there are civilians there. But then the servicemen of the Ukrainian army are obliged to release them, or they then act as terrorists in many countries of the world, like ISIS in Syria, hiding behind the civilian population. The easiest thing to do is to let these people out,” he stated.\n\nPutin also noted that the UN chief had been apparently “misinformed” about the humanitarian corridors set up by Russia, pointing out that more than 100,000 civilians have left Mariupol through them.\n\n“And they can go anywhere: some want to go to Russia, some want to go to Ukraine.

Real Madrid are a whopping 6/1 at SBK for an Etihad win while the draw pays 39/10 with the same firm.\n\nHead to head\n\nThese teams have faced off six times in Europe and there's nothing between them with two wins apiece and two draws. They last met in the round of 16 two years ago, with Guardiola's side winning 2-1 at the Etihad (below) after beating Real Madrid by the same score in Spain.\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nKevin De Bruyne usually steps up in the big games for Manchester City and it was his goal that saw off Atletico Madrid in the last round. The Belgian playmaker is 40/17 with SBK for anytime scorer but I'm more drawn to an assist at 6/4 with Paddy Power.\n\nIt's hard to look past Benzema for a Real Madrid goal after his heroics against both PSG and Chelsea. The France striker is 47/20 at Unibet for anytime scorer which looks a bit overpriced.\n\nAnything else catch the eye?\n\nOn the evidence of the two games against Chelsea this should be a thriller and I fancy both teams to score at 10/11 with Bet365, given lowly Watford managed to breach City's defence at the weekend.\n\nSkyBet are also offering a boosted 11/2 on each team having two or more shots on target in each half and that could be worth a punt as I'm expecting an open game.\n\nThe card markets are always worth a look in high-stake games and I like the 5/4 on offer at BetVictor on Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro falling foul of the referee.\n\nThis UEFA Champions League match between Manchester City and Real Madrid will be played on Apr 26, 2022 and kick off at 20:00.

Madrid’s chief is planning to keep Ancelotti at the helm, bolstering his project with the arrival of Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappe and hoping that is enough for Madrid to stay ahead of their improving rivals, Barcelona.\n\nThere seems to be a willing blindness at Madrid to some big red flags, like the 4-0 Clasico capitulation against the Catalans at Santiago Bernabeu in March, which has since been smoothed over by better results.\n\n“It was a bad night but we recovered quickly, we don’t have to think about defeats too much,” said goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. “I think with our results and attitude in the games before and after, it’s clear that it was a fluke.”\n\nIt is true that the defeat did not have big implications in their bid for La Liga, largely thanks to Madrid’s eternal rivals starting the season so miserably.\n\nHowever in the Champions League, flaws are usually exposed by the best players and coaches in the world, with Guardiola and City aiming to do just that.\n\nAnd yet the message from Madrid is positivity, despite flirting with disaster in the previous two rounds.\n\n“No matter how much you\'ve won, if you step on a banana skin or have a bad day at the office, you\'re in for a barrage of merciless criticism,” wrote Tomas Roncero in AS, in defence of Ancelotti.\n\nOne of Ancelotti’s flaws highlighted by his detractors is that he does not rotate his squad enough, relying too heavily on his starting XI with only a couple of other players frequently getting significant minutes.\n\nIn 2015, that hurt Madrid as they came up short in the Champions League semi-finals, running on empty against Juventus, and it looked like it would be the case again this season, as PSG overran them in the last 16 and Chelsea almost came from behind to overturn Los Blancos\' 3-1 first-leg lead in the quarter-finals.\n\nMadrid’s fighting spirit and self-belief, however, helped them claw through those games against the odds, and since then Ancelotti has turned to his backup players more often.\n\nIn the 3-1 win at Osasuna last Wednesday, Ancelotti started without any of his trio of key midfielders in Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, while Vinicius Junior started on the bench.\n\nWithin the club, there is no urgency to see the Italian leave, given he has performed better than expected after arriving as president Perez’s fourth-choice option last summer, following a mediocre spell at Everton.\n\nIn the international break, Perez came to the Valdebebas training ground for a long meeting with Ancelotti, and the latter left feeling reinforced.\n\nThe comeback wins against PSG, Chelsea and most recently, Sevilla, indulge Madrid’s identity - winning, even when it seems impossible.\n\nThey were on the verge of elimination by Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea for the second year in a row, but a brilliant, unrepeatable assist by the evergreen Luka Modric forced the game into extra-time.\n\nAgainst PSG, and in the first leg against Chelsea, goalkeeping errors from Gianluigi Donnarumma and Edouard Mendy helped Madrid, although credit must go to the persistent Karim Benzema, who capitalised on them.\n\nMadrid were, in particular, being crushed by the Parisians, struggling badly in the first leg with Ancelotti strangely using Modric as false nine with Benzema injured, but Donnarumma\'s mistake turned the momentum in their favour.\n\nDespite these helping hands, Madrid are right to value their capacity for comebacks and elite mentality and self-belief they have which makes it possible.\n\n“We have commitment, personality and courage from the players,” said Ancelotti after they came from 2-0 down to beat Sevilla 3-2 in the game which effectively has clinched their title. “The team is capable of doing special things.\n\n"We did not lose confidence with the 2-0 deficit and that helped us against PSG and Chelsea to believe that we could come back.”\n\nThat Ancelotti is a winner who can inspire belief and spirit like this is a plus point in his column, when it comes to Perez considering potential alternatives.\n\nYet if circumstances change before the end of the season - City inflicting a heavy Champions League beating, for example - then there is one clear candidate to replace him, in PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nPerez has liked the Argentine for a long time, while Pochettino has previously stated he would like to coach the club. He is not enjoying himself in Paris, and there looks set to be a mutual parting of ways this summer.\n\nManchester United were linked with the ex-Tottenham boss, but they have appointed Ajax coach Erik ten Hag, leaving a clear path for Madrid should they wish to look in Pochettino\'s direction.\n\nPochettino is a modern manager and likes a possession-based game, which might help Madrid establish more control in matches, something that has been lacking at times.\n\nHowever, beyond a French Cup and this season’s Ligue 1 title, Pochettino has not proven himself a winner in the same way as Ancelotti. Other names linked include former Madrid players Raul Gonzalez and Xabi Alonso, who are cutting their teeth with Real Madrid Castilla and Real Sociedad B, respectively.\n\n“I think that Carlo is a wise man, he knows how to find and put the pieces together,” said Alonso last week as he discussed his future.\n\n“We’ve spoken about it vaguely, now we’re focused on the objectives because we know they are very important,” he added. “Nothing is advanced yet.”\n\nShould Perez not change coach in the summer and things then fall apart next season, it would likely be Raul stepping in to take control on a short-term basis.\n\nHowever, at Madrid right now, thoughts of failure or a potential humiliation by City are very much out of mind. Instead, the kings of Europe are dreaming of a record 14th Champions League.\n\nAnd it would be a record for Ancelotti too, who is currently tied with Zinedine Zidane and Bob Paisley on three triumphs as a coach. A fourth would put him clear and pour scorn on his doubters, despite the evidence they have gathered this season.', 'image': 'https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:20'}

Answering that question, I emphasised that Åland\'s demilitarised status is based on international agreements. In that context, I stated that it would be easier — from a defence standpoint — to have troops stationed on Åland, but that no such proposal is forthcoming. It is up to the people of Åland to decide whether they want to start a process to change that status," he said, according to Svenska Yle.\n\nThe Swedish-language public broadcasting news outlet also reported on Monday that Åland MP Mats Löfström told Åland Radio that Vanhanen\'s comments on Sunday were misinterpreted.\n\n"I spoke with Matti Vanhanen myself after the comment was published and he said it was a misinterpretation," Löfström said, according to Svenska Yle.\n\nThe MP pointed out that the country\'s security policy was dominating the political debate in Finland.\n\n"It\'s natural, given what is happening in the world and given that Finland is seriously pursuing discussion on changing its foreign policy line by joining Nato. Therefore, everyone gets very excited about statements that are made," Löfström said, adding that such discussion can get blown out of proportion "because everyone is waiting and wants to hear them."\n\nVanhanen reiterated to Yle that, in practice, having a military base in the province would make it easier to defend it, but that it was up to the people of Åland to decide if they wanted to change their status.\n\nThe province was demilitarised after the Crimean War in 1856. The Treaty of Paris concluded that year stipulates that there can be no military force on the island, however the Finnish Border Guard operates stations there.\n\nWhen asked whether Åland\'s security situation should be strengthened during this sensitive time in terms of international affairs, Vanhanen said he trusts the Finnish Defence Forces.\n\n"[Our] agreements make it possible, if the need arises, for Finland to take care of Åland\'s defence if the need arises. It is the responsibility of the Defence Forces to properly assess required preparedness," Vanhanen told Yle.\n\nVanhanen also noted that Åland\'s special status would not prevent Finland from joining Nato.\n\nÅland\'s Premier Veronica Thörnroos said on Monday that there are no discussions in Åland about changing the status of the islands, but in an interview with Yle she did stress that Finland has the responsibility to defend the province.\n\nThörnroos was visiting Helsinki on Monday, and met Vanhanen as part of her trip. She said Vanhanen made clear that he had no intention of suggesting a change to Åland\'s demilitarised status.\n\nSign up for our weekly email hereto get a selection of the week\'s top stories in your inbox every Thursday.', 'image': 'https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_250,w_10000,h_5625/w_1200,ar_1.91,c_fill,g_faces/q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1629223239/39-843079611bf8adcc75d', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:59:11'}

On Sunday, Macron won a smashing victory over right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen, making him the first president of France’s Fifth Republic (under the new constitution adopted in 1958) to be reelected without having to share power. It’s all but certain that Macron will use his second term—his party faces parliamentary elections in June—to further pursue his dream of a truly united “ sovereign Europe ” that speaks with one voice, especially in confronting Russia.\n\nFor a brief historic moment, just after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world witnessed what appeared to be a new spirit of unity between France and Germany. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Feb. 27 declaration of Zeitenwende, or “ the turning of an era ”—meaning a dramatically stepped-up defense and independent energy policy—seemed to reinvigorate the fading idea of the West and imbue the European Union with a new sense of higher purpose. It was just the sort of reinvention that French President Emmanuel Macron has been demanding for years.\n\nFor a brief historic moment, just after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world witnessed what appeared to be a new spirit of unity between France and Germany.

It’s all but certain that Macron will use his second term—his party faces parliamentary elections in June—to further pursue his dream of a truly united “sovereign Europe” that speaks with one voice, especially in confronting Russia.\n\nYet Scholz and his ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) may be going in a different direction. Despite urgent calls for Germany to reduce or eliminate its energy dependence on Russia in the aftermath of President Vladimir Putin’s aggression, Scholz in recent days has stated clearly this is not going to happen anytime soon. He told Der Spiegel in an interview published on April 22 that an embargo on Russian gas wouldn’t affect Putin’s plans and only cause a “dramatic economic crisis” in Germany. Scholz also ruled out sending tanks or other heavy weaponry to Ukraine “to prevent an escalation that would lead to a third world war.”\n\nIt is in many ways a return to form for both countries. For five years as France’s president, Macron has sought to enlist a reluctant Germany, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, in his ambitious campaign to turn the EU into something more than a weak confederation. As he declared in his first major speech on Europe as president in 2017, “France and Germany can inject decisive, practical momentum.” While Scholz’s office boasted that the chancellor was the first foreign leader to congratulate Macron on his reelection and that the two “confirmed their intention to continue the close and trusting relationship between Germany and France,” that prospect is looking less and less likely by the day.\n\nMacron, aspiring to his ambitious role as the self-anointed leader of Europe, sought in the early weeks of the Russian invasion to reach out to Putin and find accommodation. But more recently he has shifted his stance, joining U.S. President Joe Biden to dramatically step up military aid to Ukraine by sending heavy artillery including the French-built Caesar howitzer.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, 50 members of the European Parliament sent a letter to Scholz urging him to “take a stand on the right side of history.” The MEPs, hailing from 13 member states, chided Germany for blocking the European Parliament’s April 7 resolution, which passed with a large majority, calling for “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel, and gas.” They said that even after the atrocities discovered in the town of Bucha and elsewhere, “the EU continues financing Putin’s war machine. We find it hard to believe that the proud German nation is satisfied with such [a] policy line of the German Government.”\n\nScholz is also catching flak for wavering from inside Germany—as well as from Ukraine. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany—who has since Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea chastised the German government for inaction—suggested in an interview this month that the resistance of Scholz’s SPD to sending heavy weapons or imposing an energy embargo could be attributed to the history of leading SPD politicians having a “highly questionable closeness to Russia.” These include German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Melnyk accused of a “web of contacts” with Moscow, and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who after his retirement from politics went to work for Russian corporations including Nord Stream, which owns and operates the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany that he authorized as chancellor. (Steinmeier has admitted he erred in pushing for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying, “We were holding on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in.”)\n\n“It’s exactly the wrong moment to waver on Ukraine,” said Harold James, a historian of Europe at Princeton University. “Exactly in this period is when you need to be the toughest. If Ukraine is taken apart, that’s really the end of the European dream, and Macron sees that clearly.”\n\nMacron and Scholz agree that the European NATO countries should not directly participate in the war—the French president has called it a “red line”—and that Putin’s aggression must be stopped. France and Germany have also aligned on other Russia-related issues in the past: In 2008, they joined to block a NATO membership plan for Ukraine and Georgia, saying Russia would see that as an existential threat. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush overrode their objections and insisted on a declaration that both countries would one day join NATO—a move many critics say only fed Putin’s anger and helped set the stage for his invasion.\n\nBut the recent moves by Scholz’s government suggest that Berlin is groping for a new brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of detente toward Moscow begun by then-Chancellor Willy Brandt, also an SPD member, at the height of the Cold War in the late 1960s. Before he became chancellor in early December, Scholz frankly said that was what he was seeking to do and also that Berlin should always keep discussions with Moscow open. “There is a good tradition established by Willy Brandt and [former Chancellor] Helmut Schmidt in Germany about common security in Europe,” he said in an interview last fall. Scholz also strongly supported \u200b\u200bNord Stream 2, a project he has now halted.\n\nScholz, asked to respond to Putin’s annexation and moves into eastern Ukraine in that interview, also said he was “committed to the fact that borders in Europe should no longer be moved by force.” Yet, some critics say, he appears to be heading back to the geopolitical fence that Merkel occupied for much of her 16 years in power: alternately seeking to appease Putin and to confront him diplomatically. Merkel strongly opposed arming Ukraine after Putin’s 2014 aggression and pressed then-U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt the same policy, which he mostly did—in opposition to then-Vice President Joe Biden and many other members of Obama’s administration.\n\nIf it turns out to be true that Scholz is reembracing Merkel’s ultra-cautious brand of foreign policy, it may be bad news for Macron, too. The French president has long envisioned a vastly strengthened EU with a truly integrated defense, economic, and energy policy. In his 2017 speech, he called for a joint intervention force and defense budget and for bringing “our social [and fiscal] models closer together.”\n\nTrue, the Germans, if anything, embrace the EU even more than the French do; Euroskepticism continues to be a factor in French politics, while it is virtually nonexistent in Germany. But for the most part, mainstream politicians in Germany, including Scholz, are fairly happy with the status quo of a loose federation in which EU nations are allowed to pursue their own security and economic policy. The Germans keenly want to be part of the EU without allowing it to change their culture—or compromise their powerful economy. Much of this outlook can be traced to the legacy of World War II and the leeriness of militarization that is a hallowed tenet of postwar Germany, just as Germany’s strict fiscal austerity can trace its lineage to the ruinous post-World War I hyperinflation that facilitated the rise of the Nazis.\n\nThe problem Scholz faces going forward is that the status quo is probably not possible any longer. It is probably no longer politically tenable for German politicians to find ways of accommodating Putin, and Germany must at long last wrestle with a reality it has long avoided: Building nuclear power plants is perhaps the only viable path to something close to energy independence.\n\nMacron may realize he has other problems as well; although he outpolled the insurgent Le Pen by 17 percentage points, his right-wing opponent delivered her best showing ever by playing on the fears of rising energy prices stemming partly from Western boycotts, among other issues. At a victory rally, Macron declared that “an answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right.” That includes developing a new policy toward a hostile Russia.\n\n“France needs a better Ostpolitik, and Scholz’s Germany doesn’t seem to have a Europe policy,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution. “Neither of them has really come to grips with what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means for the European security order.”', 'image': 'https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/olaf-scholz-macron-G-7-germany-GettyImages-1238300895.jpg?w=1000', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:00:46'}

Both countries have a long history of military nonalignment, and although they have gradually pursued closer cooperation with the United States and NATO—and politicians in both countries have long advocated membership—NATO accession was hardly seen as a pressing issue.\n\nPutin’s invasion of Ukraine changed all that. In response to Russian aggression, both countries are reassessing their security policies, and seeking NATO membership is rapidly emerging as the most realistic option. Recent polls show that clear and increasing majorities in both countries support joining the alliance. In addition, both countries have delivered substantial amounts of weapons to Ukraine, including 10,000 man-portable antiarmor weapons from Sweden.\n\nBy invading Ukraine, Putin sought not only to bring that country back under its influence but to also change the security order of Europe. On the latter point, he has succeeded—just not in the way he likely intended. Russia’s assault has unified NATO and made its expansion much more likely. If Finland and Sweden join the alliance, as they look poised to do, they will bring substantial new military capabilities, including advanced air and submarine capabilities, that will alter the security architecture of northern Europe and help deter further Russian aggression.\n\nARMED NEUTRALITY\n\nThe Nordic countries are similar to one another in many respects, but they have pursued very different security policies since World War II. To a large degree, these differences reflect the neighbors’ different experiences during the war. Denmark and Norway sought neutrality, but were occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940. Finland initially rebuffed a Soviet invasion in the Winter War of 1939–1940. Later, it found itself fighting on Hitler’s side until it could extricate itself from the war. Sweden alone among Nordic countries escaped the horrors of war and occupation with a policy of neutrality designed to ensure its survival. That this policy succeeded was largely because Hitler’s military calculus didn’t require the acquisition of Swedish territory; he could achieve his objectives in the area by other means.\n\nAfter the war, Sweden contemplated forming a Nordic defense union with Denmark and Norway. But negotiations broke down, mainly because Norway believed that only an alliance with the Anglo-Saxon maritime powers could guarantee its security. Sweden wasn’t ready for such alliance, in part because of the situation in Finland. Coming out of the war, Finland—which had been one country with Sweden for six centuries until 1809—was in a precarious position. It had lost its second biggest city, Viborg, and been forced to accept a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union. It had restrictions on its armed forces and a Soviet military base immediately to the west of the capital, Helsinki. The Soviets also dominated the Allied Control Commission charged with overseeing the country in the immediate postwar years.\n\nRussia’s assault has unified NATO and made its expansion much more likely.\n\nFor Sweden, ensuring that Finland didn’t fall under the yoke of the Soviets was a vital interest. Swedish leaders believed that any move toward a broader Western alliance would make Finland’s position even more precarious. And although they avoided saying so in public, this consideration was the main reason for Sweden’s policy of armed neutrality during the Cold War.\n\nBut neutrality did not mean neglect of the armed forces. Throughout the Cold War, Sweden maintained robust military forces, including an air force that for a time was seen as the fourth strongest in the world. Its official policy was one of strict military nonalignment, but it also made concealed preparations to cooperate with the United States and NATO in the event of war, and its stance was generally seen as conducive to Western security interests in the region.\n\nA POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE\n\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union, the security situation in northern Europe changed dramatically. Finland, which had gradually consolidated its position as an independent Nordic democracy, could now throw off the last shackles of the postwar period. The three Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—had broken loose from the Soviet Union even before its formal demise. And in 1995, Finland and Sweden joined the European Union, a move that both countries had previously deemed impossible because of their policies of neutrality.\n\nFor those two countries, joining the EU meant ditching the concept of neutrality. But doing so did not immediately spark discussions about joining NATO. These were the years of the 1989 Paris Charter, which sought to build a European security order that included Russia, and of the conferences that led to the establishment of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Finland and Sweden both held out hope that they would be able to develop a constructive security relationship with a democratic and reforming Russia. Even after Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania gained membership in NATO and the EU more than a decade later, there was little debate in either Sweden or Finland about reconsidering nonaligned military status.\n\nStarting in 2008, however, things in Moscow began to change markedly. Russia’s invasion of Georgia that year revealed that its threshold for using military force to pursue its political objectives was substantially lower than many had thought, and a distinctly revisionist tone started to creep into Moscow’s policy pronouncements. These trends accelerated dramatically in 2014, when Russia sought to prevent Ukraine from pursuing an association agreement with the European Union and to dismember the country through military aggression.\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine this year is drastically changing the geopolitical landscape once again. Putin’s immediate aim is to subdue Ukraine, but he is also waging a war against the West. The Russian leader and his acolytes have made it clear that they wish to replace the post-1989 security order in Europe with arrangements that impinge on the sovereignty of other countries. And just as the collapse of the Soviet Union led Sweden and Finland to reconsider their relationships to Europe, the current political earthquake has prompted them to reconsider fundamental elements of their security policies, including their relationships to NATO.\n\nPutin’s immediate aim is to subdue Ukraine, but he is also waging a war against the West.\n\nThe outcome of the war in Ukraine is still unknown. It is impossible to predict what kind of country Russia will be in the decades ahead, but what is likely to emerge is a country that is both weaker in economic and military terms and more desperate and dangerous in political terms. The Putin regime—whether he or one of his associates is at the helm—is unlikely to give up its imperial ambitions as long as it remains in power.\n\nThis reality fundamentally changes the security considerations of both Helsinki and Stockholm. Increased defense spending is clearly one part of the answer to the new security situation. Both Sweden and Denmark have announced that they will increase their defense spending to two percent of GDP, Sweden by 2028. Norway, Finland, and the three Baltic states are more or less there already. Since 2014, Finland and Sweden have also dramatically expanded their military cooperation with NATO, the United States, and the United Kingdom, creating a foundation for further cooperative steps. For more than a decade now, the Swedish, Finnish, and Norwegian air forces have been training together on close to a weekly basis.\n\nBut just strengthening defense capabilities is no longer seen as enough, which is why NATO accession is rapidly becoming a reality. Both Finland and Sweden have considered alternatives. The two governments sent a letter to all other EU members, reminding them of the solidarity provision in Paragraph 42.7 of the EU treaties, which is similar to the collective defense clause in Article 5 of the NATO Charter. Important initiatives to strengthen EU defense and security policy integration are underway, but as far as territorial defense is concerned, duplicating the institutions and command structures of NATO would make little sense and won’t happen. And of course, the EU does not include the two nations of greatest military relevance to northern Europe—the United States isn’t a member for obvious reasons, and the United Kingdom isn’t one for regrettable reasons.\n\nBoth Sweden and Finland are likely to continue to pursue measures that would make the EU into a stronger security alliance, but when it comes to territorial defense, there is simply no alternative to NATO. That has been the clear conclusion of the independent processes Helsinki and Stockholm have undertaken to evaluate alternatives.\n\nBoth Finland and Sweden will indicate their interest in joining the alliance well before the late-June NATO summit in Madrid. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said that he foresees a fairly rapid accession process in light of the high degree of military integration that Finland and Sweden have already achieved, but ratification by all 30 member states will still take time. Both countries hope that ratification, particularly in the U.S. Senate, can be fairly rapid and that existing NATO members will be ready to jointly deter any possible Russian provocations between the start of the accession process and its likely completion in 2023.\n\nA CHANGED LANDSCAPE\n\nWhen Finland and Sweden join NATO, the security architecture of northern Europe will change. Each country brings considerable military capabilities to the alliance: Finland maintains an army with very substantial reserves, and Sweden has strong air and naval forces, particularly submarine forces. With Sweden’s advanced Gripen fighters added to the F35s now ordered or under delivery to Norway, Denmark, and Finland, more than 250 highly modern fighters will be available in the region as a whole. Operated together, they will be a substantial force.\n\nIntegrated control of the entire area will make defense of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania easier, since Swedish territory and airspace in particular are important for such efforts. This will strengthen deterrence and make a conflict there less likely, according to studies published by both Sweden and Finland. But perhaps the most important consequence of Finnish and Swedish accession to NATO would be to increase the alliance’s political strength as the pillar of the defense of Europe and the transatlantic area. Both countries will help facilitate deeper coordination between the EU and NATO, thus contributing to better burden sharing across the Atlantic—a goal of increasing importance in light of the greater demands placed on the United States by the security situation in East Asia.\n\nEven as they join NATO, Finland and Sweden are likely to take care not to unduly provoke Russia by threatening its long-term security concerns. Norway, which has successfully combined strong military integration in NATO with a policy of reassurance toward Russia, could well serve as a model. The Russian forces and facilities in the Kola Peninsula—in the immediate vicinity of both Norwegian and Finnish territory—are of fundamental importance to Russia’s second-strike strategic nuclear capabilities, and Finland is, of course, close to the major population center and industrial hub of St. Petersburg. Partly for these reasons, neither Finland nor Sweden is likely to seek any permanent basing of major NATO units in their territory, and both are likely to have the same reservations about housing nuclear weapons as Denmark and Norway expressed when they joined the alliance.\n\nAs the NATO summit in Madrid approaches, the alliance will have to consider Finland’s and Sweden’s requests for rapid accession. This should be seen not only as a way to strengthen the stability of the Nordic and Baltic areas but also as an opportunity to strengthen the alliance as a whole at a time when Russia’s military aggression has made that imperative.', 'image': 'https://cdn-live.foreignaffairs.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large_1x/public/images/2022/04/25/Sweden.jpg?itok=dtqAaZZD', 'news date': 'Wed, 27 Apr 2022 01:02:24'}

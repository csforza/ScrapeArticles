But the company banned him from the platform in the wake of the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Twitter said that after reviewing Trump's tweets and the context surrounding them, it decided to permanently suspend his account \"due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nThe former president used his Twitter account in the weeks between the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 insurrection to encourage his supporters to gather in Washington in protest of the election, which he falsely claimed was rigged against him.\n\nTrump does not yet use Truth Social, though Devin Nunes, a former congressman from California who serves as the CEO of the Trump Media and Technology Group, said that's \"coming soon.\"\n\n\"President Trump has no reason to go back to Twitter, and why would we want to go and be reliant on anyone?\" Nunes told Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" in an interview Tuesday.\n\nHe and other Republicans have accused sites like Twitter and Facebook of censoring conservative voices and have called for the repeal of a 1996 law that shields social media companies from being held liable for content posted by their users.\n\nTwitter announced Monday that it reached an agreement with Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, to buy the company. The deal values the company at roughly $44 billion.

        "text": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) warned that impeachment could be on the table for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas during a trip to the southern border with other GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe border trip is meant to kick off a week where Republicans plan to seize on the issue to bolster their midterm election chances \u2014 and to put the pressure on Mayorkas, who is set to testify to the House three times on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nMcCarthy has been in the headlines for days over audio recordings of him telling other GOP lawmakers that he thought an impeachment resolution against former President Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol would pass and that Trump should resign. McCarthy denied making the remarks, before audio was released in which he could be heard making the comments.\n\nOn Monday, McCarthy suggested that he was not being untruthful because he was answering questions about whether he told Trump, which he said he \u201cnever did,\u201d redirecting attention to the border.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what\u2019s happening here right now,\u201d McCarthy said, later adding that it is Biden\u2019s Homeland Security official who should worry about impeachment if the GOP takes the House.\n\n\u201cThis is his moment in time to do his job. But at any time if someone is derelict in their job, there is always the option of impeaching somebody,\u201d McCarthy said of Mayorkas in a press conference from Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n\u201cBut right now, he\u2019s got 30 days. His first response to us should be, \u2018We should not lift Title 42,\u2019 \u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThey\u2019re not prepared to protect, and we cannot sustain what will happen to this nation.\u201d\n\nTitle 42 was first implemented by the Trump administration and later the Biden administration during the coronavirus pandemic to turn away migrants at the border. It allowed both administrations to deny asylum-seekers a hearing before a judge. The Biden administration has been sued over the issue and has said it will lift Title 42 on May 23. Later on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration from lifting the policy.\n\nThe issue has been a political gift to Republicans, who have hammered the administration over border security as vulnerable Democrats in the House and Senate have criticized Biden over the decision.\n\nA GOP-controlled House impeaching Mayorkas is far from unlikely. Republicans need to pick up just a handful of seats to take the majority, and 30 House Republicans have signed on to an impeachment resolution, led by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), against Mayorkas.\n\nMembers of House GOP leadership have not gone quite as far, but on the border trip and through other measures, they are steadily escalating their criticisms.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) said in a tweet that after hearing from local officials and community members on the trip, she sees the border situation as \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking and a dereliction of duty from Joe Biden and House Democrats.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, Stefanik, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) also joined a Monday letter to Mayorkas led by Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Brian Babin (R-Texas) that cast doubt on his ability to carry out his job duties.\n\n\u201cYour failure to secure the border and enforce the laws passed by Congress raises grave questions about your suitability for office,\u201d said the letter, signed by 133 Republican House members in total.\n\nMigrant encounters at the southern border have hit a 22-year high, according to the Department of Homeland Security, though that is partly attributable to migrants making more than one trip to the border under Title 42.\n\nThe Biden administration says Title 42 is a public health policy and that it should not be continued because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is no longer necessary. It argues it does not have the authority to put it in place as an immigration policy.\n\nIt has also said a return to regular processing under immigration law will make it harder for would-be migrants to surreptitiously cross the border, since the criminally prosecuted would risk being put in jail instead of being sent back across the border.\n\nMayorkas will address the Biden administration\u2019s budget request for his department before the House Appropriations and House Homeland Security committees on Wednesday and will appear in an oversight hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n\nMonday\u2019s congressional delegation was meant to showcase GOP unity on border and migration issues ahead of the midterm elections. Both bomb-throwers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who accused Biden of being a \u201cgreat business partner to the cartels,\u201d and more moderate members such as Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) offered criticism of the administration.\n\nMoore, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus that aims to solve problems with civility rather than hyper-partisanship, said that he does not speak much to the national media but that he is focusing on border issues because his constituents have brought it up in \u201ccountless\u201d town halls.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let politics guide you. Address the policy. Enforce the \u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 policy. It is a compassionate program, it will keep border activity to a minimum,\u201d Moore said, referring to a separate Trump administration policy under legal challenge that the Supreme Court will consider on Tuesday. The policy requires asylum-seekers at the southern border to stay in Mexico while their applications are processed.\n\nAlso on the border trip were Rep. Tony Gonzales (Texas), whose district includes Eagle Pass; House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer (Ala.); Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Randy Weber; Rep. Diana Harshbarger (Tenn.); and Rep. Michael Guest (Miss.).\n\n\u201cBiden bears responsibility for this. I don\u2019t see how he sleeps well at night,\u201d Weber said.\n\nDays earlier in Eagle Pass, a 22-year-old Texas Army National Guard specialist, Bishop Evans, died after he tried to save two migrants crossing into the U.S. through the Rio Grande. He went missing on Friday, and the Texas Military Department of Affairs said Monday that his body was recovered.\n\nThe tragedy fueled Republican arguments that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019d just secure our border and do our job, we wouldn\u2019t have that loss of life,\u201d Roy said in a video taken at Eagle Pass Monday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border over the last year.\n\nMcCarthy pledged to fix border issues if Republicans win back the House.\n\n\u201cIn 30 days from now, President Biden could lift Title 42. It will be unsustainable beyond means of what will happen to this nation. We got to be able to first to stop that,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cAnd then, in 197 days from now, we can secure this border once and for all.\u201d",

I do not want the danger to be artificially inflated [but] it is serious, real. It cannot be underestimated.'\n\nSergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, has warned that NATO is now fighting a proxy-war against Moscow and there is a 'very significant' risk the conflict will turn nuclear\n\nLavrov accused the West of risking a third world war in Ukraine by supplying weapons with the hope of 'wearing out the Russian army' - a goal he called 'an illusion'.

In total, 317 officers of junior lieutenant rank and above have been killed in a little over two months of fighting, analysis by outlet MediaZona revealed today. Almost a third came from the most senior grades - major or above - including at least two generals and the deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea fleet. MediaZona, which is currently blocked in Russia but continues to operate online, compiled its data by looking at public reports of troop deaths from local government officials, newspapers, or families posting on social media. That means the figures will be far lower than the true total because of delays between the troops being killed and their deaths being reported, difficulties in identifying bodies, and deliberate cover-ups by Moscow. In total, MediaZona found 1,744 reports of military deaths in Ukraine - higher than the Kremlin's official figure of 1,351 which it has not updated since late March. It found 317 of those deaths were of officers, which accounts for almost a fifth of the total figure. MediaZona believes that is because officer deaths are more-likely to be reported than those of foot-soldiers. The highest-ranked deaths that Russia has acknowledged are of Andrei Sukhovetsky and Vladimir Frolov, who were both Major Generals. Russia has also acknowledged the death of Captain 1st Rank Andrei Paly, the deputy commander of its Black Sea fleet, MediaZona said.

Washington understood how Moscow was behaving. Now there are few rules left.\n\nHe added: 'In those years, there was a channel of communication that both leaders trusted. Now there is no such channel. Nobody is trying to create it.'\n\nAmerica did set up a 'deconfliction line' to Moscow in the early days of the Ukraine war, but said the Russia side stopped answering.\n\nLavrov also repeated warnings that shipments of western weapons into Ukraine will be considered legitimate targets by Russia - a day after missiles struck the country's train network in an apparent attempt to stop the deliveries.\n\nhe spoke as western nations shift focus in Ukraine from supplying small arms and defensive weapons such as anti-tank and anti-aricraft missiles, to providing heavier arms such as tanks, helicopters, aircraft and long-range artillery.\n\nThe move comes in response to calls from Kyiv to provide its armed forces with the means to recapture territory occupied by Russian forces, in the wake of atrocities carried out by Putin's men in places such as Bucha and Irpin.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin travelled to Kyiv on Sunday for a face-to-face meeting with President Zelensky to discuss supplies, before pledging another multi-million dollar shipment.\n\nAustin will also chair a meeting of more than 40 defence ministers at Ramstein air base in Germany today, aimed at securing additional supplies and coordinating efforts between allies to ensure Ukraine has everything it needs.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Austin stated the goal is to ensure Ukraine 'can win' the war against Russia and 'weaken' the country to the point where it cannot repeat its invasion a second time.\n\nAhead of the meeting, German media reported that the country will end weeks of dithering and agree to supply heavy arms to Ukraine in the form of 50 Gepard anti-aircraft systems.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday night that he regards Russia's scaremongering as a sign of weakness.\n\nLavrov, speaking to Russian state TV, said tensions between east and west are now at a worse point than during the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War\n\nRussia considers western arms shipments to Ukraine legitimate targets for attack, Lavrov added, after the US pledged to send heavier weapons to the country this week (file image)\n\nMaria, 13, holds a photograph of her father Yurii Alekseev, 50, a territorial defence member who according to his family was killed by Russian soldiers, as she mourns him during his funeral today\n\nTetyana Boikiv, 52, right, meets and hugs her neighbour Svitlana Pryimachenko, 48, during a funeral service for her husband, Mykola Moroz\n\nGermany will finally authorise tank deliveries to Ukraine Germany will finally authorise the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine today after weeks of dithering that has tarnished its reputation on the world stage and led to questions about its commitment to European security. Defense minister Christine Lambrecht is expected announce the delivery of around 50 Gepard anti-aircraft vehicles to Ukraine during a meeting of more than 40 nations that will take place at Ramstein air base today. Germany's defence industry has been offering to sell the Gepard vehicles to Ukraine since February, but had been blocked from doing so by Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government which led to outcry both inside and outside the country. Scholz, whose SPD party traditionally maintains close ties with Russia, had argued that it would take too long to train Ukrainian soldiers to use the weapons, that Germany had no weapons to sell, and that selling weapons could provoke Putin. But under strong pressure from Germany's international allies as well as his own coalition partners, Scholz now appears to have decided to change course. Lambrecht will today deliver a speech at Ramstein air base in which she will say the government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks. At the same time, a plan will be submitted to parliament calling for the government to 'continue and, where possible, accelerate the delivery of equipment to Ukraine.' Equipment will be extended to include 'the delivery [of] heavy weapons and complex systems', according to a draft of the document shown to AFP. The same document will suggest that Ukrainian soldiers are brought to Germany and other NATO nations so they can be trained how to use the weapons. Advertisement\n\nRussia had lost its 'last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine,' Kuleba wrote on Twitter after Lavrov's interview. 'This only means Moscow senses defeat.'\n\nBritish armed forces minister James Heappey agreed with that assessment today, saying he does not see an imminent threat of escalation in Ukraine and dismissing Lavrov's comments as 'bravado'.\n\n'Lavrov's trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don't think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation,' Heappey told BBC Television.\n\n'What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia.'\n\nHeappey told Sky News that while NATO had been reinforcing its eastern flank, it was not, as an organisation, providing military aid.\n\n'The donor community is not NATO,' Heappey said. 'The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid.'\n\nDuring a visit to Kyiv on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised more military aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Monday used an emergency declaration to approve the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine.\n\nThe Pentagon said the package could include artillery ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.\n\nMoscow's ambassador to Washington told the United States to halt shipments, warning Western weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nLavrov said: 'NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.'\n\nRussia's two-month-old invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced over 5 million people to flee abroad.\n\nMoscow calls its actions a 'special operation' to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West says this a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe United States is due to host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries this week for Ukraine-related defence talks that will focus on arming Kyiv, U.S. officials said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin (centre) and Chair of Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley (centre left) chair a meeting to agree more arms for Ukraine at Ramstein air base in Germany\n\nChristine Lambrecht, German defence minister, meets her Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov as she prepares to announce supplies of heavy arms to Kyiv\n\nRussia is trying to 'destabilise' breakaway Moldovan region Kyiv today accused Russia of trying to 'destabilise' Moldova's breakaway region that borders Ukraine after two explosions there prompted fears of Russia launching 'false flag' attacks to justify invading the territory. The explosions destroyed two powerful Soviet-era radio antennas that were re-broadcasting Russian stations in the region of Transnistria, an unrecognised Moscow-backed sliver of land bordering southwestern Ukraine, on Tuesday. The blasts occurred in the small town of Maiac roughly 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of the border with Ukraine, just days after a Kremlin military chief warned that 'Russian-speakers' had been 'oppressed' there. A day earlier, several explosions believed to be caused by rocket-propelled grenades were reported to hit the Ministry of State Security in the city of Tiraspol, the region's capital. No one was hurt in the explosions, officials said. On Tuesday, a military unit in the village of Parcani was also targeted. Officials did not offer any details on the incident, but declared a 'red level of terrorist threat' and promised to impose additional security measures in the region.

Its forces were forced to pull back from the outskirts of Kyiv in the face of stiff resistance.\n\n'It is obvious that every day - and especially today, when the third month of our resistance has begun - that everyone in Ukraine is concerned with peace, about when it will all be over,' President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday.\n\n'There is no simple answer to that at this time.'\n\nHaving failed to take the capital Kyiv, Moscow last week launched a massive assault in an attempt to capture eastern provinces known as the Donbas, which if successful would link territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014.\n\nUkraine's general staff said on Tuesday that Russia's offensive continued in the eastern Kharkiv region with Russian forces trying to advance towards Zavody.\n\nRussia's defence ministry earlier said its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to deliver foreign weapons to Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. Reuters could not verify the report.\n\nThe head of Ukraine's state rail company said that one railway worker had been killed and four injured by Russian missile strikes on five Ukrainian railway stations on Monday.\n\nUkrainian forces have repelled five Russian attacks and killed just over 200 Russian servicemen, said the Ukrainian military command in the southern and eastern sectors.\n\nAn Ukrainian tank drives through obstacles on a road near Slovyansk, eastern Ukraine, today amid the Russian invasion\n\nA huge pile of missiles is gathered up by members of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine after shellings in Kharkiv\n\nFirefighters extinguish fire at a substation near the Krasne Railway Station following Russian shelling, amid Russia's attack\n\nFive tanks were also destroyed, along with eight armoured vehicles, it said in a statement.\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country's east, the British military said in an update on Tuesday.\n\nReports say the city of Kreminna has fallen, with heavy fighting in the south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, Britain's defence ministry said on Twitter.\n\nThe governor of Russia's Belgorod province, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukraine had fired on two villages, and at least two people were wounded. Reuters was unable to verify the Ukrainian or Russian reports.\n\nRussian forces were continuing on Monday to bomb and shell the vast Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol where fighters are hunkered down in a city ravaged by a siege and bombardment, Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said.\n\nMoscow said it was opening a humanitarian corridor to let civilians out of the plant but Kyiv said no agreement had been reached.\n\nUkraine war timeline: Putin's invasion enters its third month Russia heads into the third month of its invasion of Ukraine on Sunday with no end in sight to fighting that has killed thousands, uprooted millions and reduced cities to rubble. In the face of mounting sanctions and fierce Ukrainian resistance bolstered by Western arms, Russia has kept up its long-distance bombardment and opened up a new offensive in the east. Some key events so far: February 24: Russia invades Ukraine from three fronts in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Tens of thousands flee. Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is launching a 'special military operation' to demilitarise and 'denazify' Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweets: 'Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself.' February 25: Ukrainian forces battle Russian invaders in the north, east and south. Artillery pounds Kyiv and its suburbs and authorities tell residents to prepare Molotov cocktails to defend the capital. February 26: A U.S. defence official says Ukraine's forces are putting up 'determined resistance'. February 28: The first talks between the two sides make no breakthrough. March 1: Russia hits a TV tower in Kyiv and intensifies bombardment of Kharkiv in the northeast and other cities, in what is seen as a shift in tactics as Moscow's hopes of a quick charge on the capital fade. A U.S. official says a miles-long Russian armoured column bearing down on Kyiv has not made any advances in the past 24 hours, bogged down by logistical problems. March 2: Russian forces bombard the southern port of Mariupol for 14 hours and stop civilians leaving, its mayor says - the start of Moscow's blockade of the city. Russia denies targeting civilians. Russian troops reach the centre of the Black Sea port of Kherson and claim their first capture of a large urban centre. March 3: Russia and Ukraine agree to set up humanitarian corridors for fleeing civilians. A cargo ship sinks near a Ukrainian port hours after another is hit by a blast at another port. A million people have fled Ukraine, the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) says. March 4: Russian forces seize Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest. NATO rejects Ukraine's appeal for no-fly zones, saying it would escalate the conflict. March 6: 'Rivers of blood and tears are flowing in Ukraine,' Pope Francis tells crowds in St. Peter's Square. 'This is not just a military operation, but a war, which sows death, destruction, and misery.' March 8: Civilians flee the besieged city of Sumy in the first successful humanitarian corridor. Two million have now fled Ukraine, the UNHCR says. March 9: Ukraine accuses Russia of bombing a maternity hospital in Mariupol, burying people in rubble. Russia later says the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters. March 13: Russia extends its war deep into western Ukraine, firing missiles at a base in Yavoriv close to the border with NATO member Poland. The attack kills 35 people and wounds 134, a local official says. March 14: Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova bursts into a state TV studio during a live news bulletin, with a banner reading: 'NO WAR. Stop the war. Don't believe propaganda. They are lying to you here.' March 16: Ukraine accuses Russia of bombing a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of civilians are sheltering. Moscow denies it. March 25: Moscow signals it is scaling back its ambitions and will focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the east, as Ukrainian forces go on the offensive to recapture towns outside Kyiv. March 29: Ukraine proposes adopting a neutral status during talks in Istanbul. March 30: More than 4 million people have fled Ukraine, the UNHCR says. April 1: Ukraine recaptures more territory around Kyiv from Russian soldiers who leave shattered villages and abandoned tanks as they move away from the capital. April 3/4: Ukraine accuses Russia of war crimes after a mass grave and bodies of people shot at close range are found in the recaptured town of Bucha. The Kremlin denies responsibility and says images of bodies were staged. April 8: Ukraine and its allies blame Russia for a missile attack on a train station in Kramatorsk that killed at least 52 people trying to flee the looming eastern offensive. Russia denies responsibility. April 14: Russia's lead warship in the Black Sea, the Moskva, sinks after an explosion and fire that Ukraine says was caused by a missile strike. Russia says the ship sank after an ammunition explosion. Washington believes the warship was hit by two Ukrainian missiles. April 18: Russia launches its assault on east Ukraine, unleashing thousands of troops in what Ukraine described as the Battle of the Donbas, a campaign to seize two provinces and salvage a battlefield victory. April 20: More than 5 million people have fled Ukraine, the UNHCR says. April 21: Putin declares the southeastern port of Mariupol 'liberated' after nearly two months of siege, despite leaving hundreds of defenders holding out inside a giant steel works. April 22: A Russian general says Moscow wants to take full control of southern and eastern Ukraine. April 24: Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin travel to Kyiv, becoming the highest-level US delegation to make the journey since war with Russia broke out April 25: Germany agrees to send anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, reversing earlier policy not to supply heavy weapons Advertisement\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Boobytrapped milk carton primed with a BOMB is given to grandmother by Russian soldier distributing 'humanitarian aid' in Ukraine\n\nBy Ed Wight for MailOnline\n\nA Ukrainian grandmother has narrowly escaped death after a Russian soldier gave her a boobytrapped carton of milk loaded with explosives.\n\nIn a disturbing new twist to Putin's war on Ukraine, Russian soldiers are now pretending to hand out 'humanitarian aid'.\n\nBut when the pensioner from the besieged city of Kherson went to open the screw top carton she noticed wires attached to the lid.\n\nFurther investigation revealed the wires led to a detonator.\n\nThe OAP's son told local media in.kherson.ua: 'My retired mother noticed that there was something wrong with this milk, as if someone had been drinking from it before, or if it was broken.\n\n'She carefully unscrewed the cap and showed me what was there.'\n\nThe boobytrapped milk carton contained a homemade explosive attached to a fishing line which when opened would detonate the bomb.\n\nA Ukrainian grandmother has narrowly escaped death after a Russian soldier gave her a boobytrapped carton of milk loaded with explosives. When the pensioner from the besieged city of Kherson went to open the screw top carton she noticed wires attached to the lid\n\nFurther investigation revealed the wires led to a detonator placed inside the carton in what appeared to be a cruel boobytrap\n\nAn elderly Ukrainian woman is pictured receiving aid from soldiers in Ukraine - it is not clear whether this is the woman who picked up the boobytrapped milk carton\n\nThe OAP's soon told local media in.kherson.ua: 'My retired mother noticed that there was something wrong with this milk, as if someone had been drinking from it before, or if it was broken. She carefully unscrewed the cap and showed me what was there.' The boobytrapped milk carton contained a homemade explosive attached to a fishing line which when opened would detonate the bomb\n\nThe woman's son added: 'The bag of aid was bought home by my mother, although I had asked her not to.\n\n'But yesterday she took the groceries. She saw that the screw in the milk was not airtight, she thought that someone had already drank it, that it might be spoiled, she carefully unscrewed it and saw something like thread.'\n\nTo fool locals into thinking the products are safe, Russian soldiers are using products made in Ukraine.\n\nOn Sunday, the UK's MOD reported that Russia plans to hold a staged referendum in Kherson to justify its occupation.\n\nIn its daily intelligence update, the ministry wrote: 'This city is key to the Russian goal of creating an overland corridor to Crimea and dominating southern Ukraine.\n\n'Russia previously held an illegal referendum on the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation in 2014 to retroactively justify the occupation of the peninsula.'\n\nNow Russia cuts off WATER supplies Desperate Ukrainians hit by a lack of food have had their water cut off by Russian shelling too. Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai accused the Kremlin of systematically attacking electricity plants and water pumps to punish the local population. Last week officials in Luhansk said Russian forces had deliberately targeted the supply of food to the eastern region. They swamped the key city of Sievierodonetsk with missiles that wiped out all food depots, as well as markets and shops. The city\u2019s 100,000 population has fallen by 17,000 and they are now reliant on aid supplies. Advertisement\n\nEvidence of Russian soldiers boobytrapping humanitarian aid packages for elderly Ukrainian residents comes as Kremlin insiders told The Financial Times that Putin has given up on peace talks with Ukraine and is intent on seizing as much land as possible.\n\nThe three insiders claimed that the Russian president wanted to grab territory because he felt negotiations had reached a 'dead end'.\n\nOne insider said: 'There was hope for a deal. Putin was going back and forth. He needs to find a way to come out of this a winner.'\n\n'Putin sincerely believes in the nonsense he hears on [Russian] television and he wants to win big,' another insider added.\n\nA third said he wouldn't sign anything after the humiliation caused by the sinking of the Moskva.\n\nA senior member of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umirov, said: 'We continue the negotiation process. Primarily \u2014 to save more lives of our people.'\n\n'We will use all the political and diplomatic efforts to stop this bloodshed. But there are red lines we will never cross. Ukraine will never give up its people and its territories,' he told The Times.\n\nMeanwhile, officials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new '200-yard mass grave' has been identified north of the city that could contain hundreds of bodies.\n\nVladimir Putin has given up on peace talks with Ukraine as he wants to seize as much land as he can for Russia, according to Kremlin insiders\n\nEmergency management specialists and volunteers remove the debris of a theatre building destroyed in the course of Ukraine-Russia conflict in the southern port city of Mariupol\n\nSmoke rises above a plant of Azovstal Iron and Steel Works during Ukraine-Russia conflict in the southern port city of Mariupol\n\nMayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about six miles north of Mariupol.\n\nThis would be the third after satellite photos released over the last few days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves.\n\nOn Saturday, chilling satellite photos revealed a second mass grave near Mariupol - as Russian forces continued to pummel the last 2,000 Ukrainian defenders trapped in a steelworks in the city.\n\nThe photos from Maxar Technologies showed the site at a cemetery in the town of Vynohradne. It has several newly dug parallel trenches measuring about 131 feet long, Maxar said in a statement.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky warned Vladimir Putin that if he tried to build a Nazi-style 'millennial Reich' he would 'lose'.",

Some people have called for financial or other reparations.\n\nThe report laid out a history of enslaved people toiling on the campus and of the university benefiting from the slave trade and industries linked to slavery after slavery was outlawed in Massachusetts in 1783, 147 years after Harvard\u2019s founding.\n\nThe report also documents Harvard excluding Black students and its scholars advocating racism.\n\nWhile Harvard employed notable figures among abolitionists and in the civil rights movement, the report said: \u201cThe nation\u2019s oldest institution of higher education \u2026 helped to perpetuate the era\u2019s racial oppression and exploitation.\u201d\n\nThe report\u2019s authors recommended offering descendants of people enslaved at Harvard educational and other support so they \u201ccan recover their histories, tell their stories, and pursue empowering knowledge\u201d.\n\nOther recommendations included that the Ivy League school fund summer programs to bring students and faculty from long-underfunded historically Black colleges and universities to Harvard, and to send Harvard students and faculty to the institutions, known as HBCUs, such as Howard University, in Washington DC.\n\nIn his email, Bacow said a committee would explore transforming the recommendations into action and that a university governing board had authorized $100m for implementation, with some of the funds held in an endowment.\n\n\u201cSlavery and its legacy have been a part of American life for more than 400 years,\u201d Bacow wrote. \u201cThe work of further redressing its persistent effects will require our sustained and ambitious efforts for years to come.\u201d\n\nOther US institutions of higher learning have created funds in recent years to address legacies of slavery.\n\nA law enacted in Virginia last year requires five public state universities to create scholarships for descendants of people enslaved by the institutions.",

        "text": "Let's recap what happened at NYU Law School recently. NYU Students for Justice in Palestine sent out an email in essence justifying Palestinians terrorists murdering Israeli civilians. In the course of doing so, the author of the email threw some antisemitic tropes regarding Jewish control of the media, including arguing that \"framing is everything and the Zionist grip on the media is omnipresent\" and referencing the \"Islamophobic, Zionist-funded US and Western media.\" Several other NYU student groups chimed in to endorse the email.\n\nDefenders of the email, as one would expect, argue that vehemently criticizing Israel and Zionism, even arguing that Palestinians have the right to murder Israel civilians to resist \"occupation,\" is not antisemitic. However, as I noted in my original post on the matter, the lines noted in the above paragraph criticize neither Israel as a state nor Zionism as an ideology. Rather, they claim that \"Zionists\" fund and control the media. And as I noted, the most obvious form of antisemitism that tries to obscure itself behind antizionism is when one can substitute the word \"Zionist\" for the word \"Jew,\" and one is left with an obvious, longstanding antisemitic trope, as with the NYU SJP email.\n\nI can easily imagine a student or student organization signing on to the statement, not recognizing or noticing the obvious (at least to those with some knowledge of the history and practice of antisemitism) antisemitic implications of claiming that Zionists fund and control an Islamaphobic media. And I can easily imagine them regretting this language, even if they decline to publicly apologize for it or retract it. Indeed, I would think that even antisemitic students would regret the language in question, because it associates a cause they support with antisemitism, which simply isn't a good strategy, at least in the US.\n\nMore generally, when someone uses antisemitic language, I'm inclined to point it out, but not suggest that the individual himself or herself is antisemitic. Some people pick up antisemitic tropes unknowingly or negligently. Some use overly provocative language without really thinking of the implications.\n\nI'd prefer that such individuals retract and/or apologize for their language. But even if they don't, I'm still hesitant to judge them more harshly than what I suggested in the previous paragraph. I'm also inclined to give the benefit of the doubt in general to people who are speaking (or tweeting) off the cuff.\n\nBut I draw the line at people who, once their antisemitic language has been pointed out to them, choose to double down on it. That includes NYU law student Yosmin Badie, previously best known for repeatedly tweeting \"fuck Israel,\" along with the occasional \"fuck Amerikkka.\" As reported by JTA:\n\nYosmin Badie, a member of NYU Law's Students for Justice in Palestine, said in a statement to the New York Jewish Week that the response to the [Student of Justice in Palestine's] emails was \"shameful.\" \"The effort to silence those who choose to speak out against apartheid and violent occupation is shameful, and equally shameful is the purposeful conflation of antisemitism and anti-Zionism,\" Badie said. \"I will not be intimidated by those who wish to deny this right and will continue to unequivocally stand with Palestinians in their struggle,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Ms. Badie, you see, not only was the email not antisemitic but only \"antizionist\" (please tell us, Ms. Badie, who these \"Zionists\" are who control and fund the media?), but pointing out and criticizing the underlying antisemitism is an attempt to silence her.\n\nI'm not here to silence or \"cancel\" Ms. Badie. But I also don't see that Jews need to sit back and let antisemites like Ms. Badie hide behind \"antizionism\" while purporting to represent anti-racism and progressive values and not call them out for it. (And by the way, in case you are inclined to think that Ms. Badie must have been traumatized by her experiences as a Palestinian victim of Israel or whatever formulation people use to excuse Palestinian extremism, she identifies herself on Twitter as an \"Iranian American\" and has been affiliated with the National Iranian American Council, known for running interference in the US on behalf of the Iranian theocracy. Always interesting to find self-proclaimed \"human rights activists\" with origins in horrible dictatorships who focus their energy on Israel instead.)\n\nSo, Ms. Badie, you have a right to spew whatever antisemitic (and genocidal) rhetoric you wish. And I may point out that you are an antisemite. And, for what it's worth, the same applies to any of your classmates who continue to defend the email SJP sent out.\n\nAnd while we are on the subject, readers should check out NYU law student Tal Fortgang's essay at Bari Weiss' substack, To the Antisemites Who Sit Next to Me in School.\n\nUPDATE: If you thought that perhaps by now SJP at NYU Law would have second thoughts about using antisemitic tropes in its communications, and might acknowledge that it was a mistake to use such tropes, you would be wrong.",

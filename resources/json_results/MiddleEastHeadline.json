The Ukrainian defence ministry called the events a \u201cplanned provocation by the Russian special services.\u201d Moldova\u2019s president warned they were an attempt to escalate tensions, blaming \u201cpro-war factions\u201d within the breakaway territory.\n\nHere is what you should know about Transnistria and why it matters in the context of the continuing Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nWhat is Transnistria?\n\nTransnistria, also commonly known as Transdniester, is a narrow strip of land between the east bank of the Dniester River and Moldova\u2019s border with Ukraine.\n\nOf a total population of about 470,000 people, ethnic Russians and Ukrainians together outnumber ethnic Moldovans.\n\nWhile internationally recognised as part of Moldova, the Russian-backed breakaway territory has been under the control of separatist authorities since 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union triggered a conflict between the newly independent Republic of Moldova and separatists who wanted to maintain Soviet ties.\n\nNo country, including Russia, recognises the territory as independent, but Moldovan authorities have no control over the region, which functions akin to a separate state.\n\nWhat does Transnistria have to do with the Russia-Ukraine conflict?\n\nRussia has an estimated 1,500 soldiers in Transnistria, which Moscow refers to as a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d force. Kyiv is concerned that those forces could be used to attack Ukraine from the west.\n\nRussia carried out military drills in the region as recently as February 2, and has said the Russian presence is essential to protect their citizens in the area and keep the peace between Moldovans and Transnistrians.\n\nShould Russian President Vladimir Putin decide to involve Transnistria in the war in some capacity, it has little leverage to refuse, as it remains economically dependent on Russia, including for free gas.\n\nWhat are Russia\u2019s interests in Transnistria?\n\nRustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district, was quoted last week by state news agencies as saying that Russia aimed to take control of southern Ukraine, which would give it access to Transnistria.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Russian military, embroiled in a fight to take eastern Ukraine, would be able to seize more territory in southern Ukraine and advance towards Moldova.\n\nBut Russia could potentially seek to use Transnistria to assist with medical aid and food, guarding convoys and securing the railway network, and offering a safe space where to resupply its troops, repair equipment and regroup.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Russia\u2019s invasion of his country was just the beginning and that Moscow has designs on seizing territory in other countries, as well.\n\nIs Moldova a NATO member?\n\nMoldova is a not part of the transatlantic military alliance and has sought to stay neutral since its independence, with neutrality enshrined in its constitution.\n\nThere are concerns about its ability to defend itself from a potential Russian invasion should Putin push towards its border with Ukraine.\n\nHowever, last month the nation of about 2.6 million submitted a bid to join the European Union, along with Georgia and Ukraine.\n\nDoes Russia have ambitions in the region?\n\nA week into Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, a video surfaced showing Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko standing next to a map that appeared to indicate Transnistria as a potential target.\n\nOfficials in Belarus later said the map was a mistake.\n\nMoldova has a long history of domination by the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union. However, it has been transitioning away from Russian influence since the 1990s, slowly moving towards Europe.",

It would be logical to go first to Ukraine, to see the people there, the consequences of the occupation,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nTurkey is one of the most active countries working to ensure a permanent cease-fire between Ukraine and Russia. Its delicately balanced act of assuming a role as a mediator by keeping communication channels with both warring sides open provides a glimmer of hope in diplomatic efforts to find a solution and achieve peace in the Ukraine crisis. With its unique position of having friendly relations with both Russia and Ukraine, Turkey has won widespread praise for its push to end the war.\n\nSince the beginning of the conflict, Ankara has offered to mediate between the two sides and host peace talks, underlining its support for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty. While Ankara has opposed international sanctions designed to isolate Moscow, it also closed its straits to prevent some Russian vessels from crossing through them.\n\nIn a breakthrough, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met for peace talks in Istanbul on March 29 as the war entered its second month with casualties piling up on both sides. During the talks, Ukrainian officials signaled readiness to negotiate a \u201cneutral status,\u201d a key Russian demand, but demanded security guarantees for their country. Ukraine wants to see countries, including Turkey, as guarantors in a deal with Russia, a Ukrainian negotiator said after the talks. Russia, meanwhile, pledged to significantly decrease its military activities focusing on the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv to build trust for future negotiations.",

Guterres is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Thursday.\n\nDuring a news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Guterres said he has proposed a \u201cHumanitarian Contact Group\u201d of Russia, Ukraine and UN officials \u201cto look for opportunities for the opening of safe corridors, with local cessations of hostilities, and to guarantee that they are actually effective\u201d.\n\nMoscow describes its February 24 invasion of Ukraine as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d and has denied targeting civilians. It has blamed Ukraine for the repeated failure of humanitarian corridors.\n\nOn April 21, Russia declared victory in Mariupol although remaining Ukrainian forces held out in a vast underground complex below Azovstal.\n\nRussia said on Monday it would open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the steel plant, but Ukraine said there was no such agreement and that Russia was still attacking it.\n\nPutin says \u2018hopeful\u2019 over talks\n\nIn televised remarks, Putin told Guterres that he still had hope for negotiations to end the conflict.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that the military operation is ongoing, we still hope that we will be able to reach agreements on the diplomatic track,\u201d Putin said.\n\n\u201cWe are negotiating, we do not reject [talks].\u201d\n\nPutin noted that Russian and Ukrainian negotiators made what he described as a \u201cserious breakthrough\u201d in their talks in Istanbul, Turkey, last month.\n\nHe claimed, however, that the Ukrainian side later walked back on some of the tentative agreements reached in Istanbul.\n\nIn particular, Putin said Ukrainian negotiators have changed their position on the issue of the status of Crimea and separatist territories in eastern Ukraine, offering to leave it for the countries\u2019 presidents to discuss.\n\nThe Russian president charged that the shift in the Ukrainian stand makes it hard to negotiate a future deal.\n\nPutin has demanded that Ukraine recognise Russia\u2019s sovereignty over Crimea and recognise the independence of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine as part of a future agreement on ending the hostilities.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that those issues could only be decided by a future referendum.\n\nUkraine had proposed an international agreement whereby other countries would guarantee its security.

Initial polling showed the vote was sharply split both by age and socio-economic status: Two-thirds of working class voters backed le Pen, while similar proportions of white-collar executives and pensioners backed Macron, an Elabe poll showed. Macron won around 59% of votes by 18-24 year-olds with the vote almost evenly split in other age categories.

According to a statement released by AIMTA, the salary offers were not acceptable to the workers. Bombardier was offering salary raises of 2.5 per cent for the first year, then 2.25 per cent for the last two years of a three-year collective agreement.\n\nArticle content In an interview with the Canadian Press, Eric Rancourt, a business agent at AIMTA\u2019s District 11, explained that the two parties were so far apart in salary matters that even before negotiations began on the topic, the union asked management to provide its best offer, which was then rejected almost unanimously.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cIt\u2019s well below the inflation we\u2019re experiencing at the moment, which is hitting new heights, and people are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not worth more than that?\u2019\u201c Rancourt said, adding that the workers expected Bombardier to return the favour for past concessions on their part. During the signing of the last collective agreement, which ended in December, the unionized employees felt they had made compromises on salary due to the difficult financial situation in which the company found itself. Now that things have improved, workers want to be rewarded.\n\nArticle content \u201cWe felt the frustration rising during the assembly,\u201d Rancourt said, \u201cbecause (the employees) don\u2019t feel valued now that things are going better at Bombardier.\u201d Bombardier said in a statement the company was \u201con the right track\u201d and it believed it had made an \u201cequitable\u201d offer for a new contract.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The workers\u2019 association also believes that improved working conditions would help Bombardier attract new talent, given the current work shortage and the fierce competition to recruit workers in the aerospace industry. Following the vote, the union informed management of the result and extended an invitation for the renewal of talks as quickly as possible at the beginning of the week.\n\nArticle content Rancourt added that on top of salary matters, discussions must continue on the topics of sub-contracting (internal and external) over the duration of the work contract, and of the indexation at the cost of living of retirees\u2019 pensions. Following the resounding refusal of the offer from management, the unionized employees accorded a strike mandate to their representatives with 98.8 per cent support. This mandate is not technically a strike vote, according to Rancourt. Should the union wish to make use of the strike mandate to decree strike days or even a general strike, it would have to call another general assembly to obtain approval from members. Local section 712 of AIMTA represents 1,800 Bombardier employees on the final assembly line in Dorval and at the manufacturing centre in St-Laurent.

Masks remain mandatory in hospitals, elderly care facilities and on international flights.\n\nIsrael has seen new cases of COVID-19 drop since the peak of the latest wave of infections in January. Serious cases of coronavirus have plummeted from a high of over 1,200 during the omicron variant outbreak to around 200.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic two years ago, Israel has recorded over 4 million cases of coronavirus and at least 10,658 deaths \u2014 over one-fifth of them since January, according to the Health Ministry.\n\nOver 72% of the country\u2019s 9.4 million people have at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and nearly half have received three shots.\n\nSunday 7:11 a.m.: Volunteers and low-level government workers in Shanghai have erected metal barriers in multiple districts to block off small streets and entrances to apartment complexes, as China hardens its strict \u201czero-COVID\u201d approach in the metropolis.\n\nIn the city\u2019s financial district, Pudong, the barriers \u2014 either thin metal sheets or mesh fences \u2014 were put up in several neighbourhoods under a local government directive, according to Caixin, a Chinese business media outlet.

Now what?\n\nWell, you\u2019ve completed the Sun Run. Now it\u2019s time to collapse on the couch and give in to inertia, gravity, and snack food cravings.\n\nNot so, says Running Room CEO John Stanton.\n\n\u201cYou need to set a new goal. It gives you discipline. And you want to maintain the level of fitness you\u2019ve achieved, and build upon that.\u201d\n\nMost runners train for at least 10 weeks leading up to the race. \u201cIn that time, many people, especially if they\u2019re new to running, they will have seen a dramatic change in their overall level of fitness and confidence and mental well-being,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably sleeping better and they\u2019re probably eating better.\u201d\n\nTo maintain that level of fitness and even improve upon it he suggests making new goals, such as planning another 10k run.\n\n\u201cAnd set a target, such as a five-minute time goal. In other words, if you ran the Sun Run in 65 minutes, then your next race maybe you should try to break 60 minutes. And that five-minute increment or performance is what I call \u2018an intelligent goal.\u2019 It\u2019s slightly out of reach, but attainable.\u201d\n\nRead more of Stanton\u2019s pro advice here.\n\n\u2014 Shawn Conner\n\nGood weather for race day\n\nThe sun is shining on the Vancouver Sun Run, with temperatures set to hit a high of 16\u00baC.\n\nThe race day weather forecast is for a mix of sun and cloud, with 30 per cent chance of showers late this afternoon. Wind becoming southeast 20 km/h this morning. High 16. UV index 4 or moderate.\n\nRoad closures for the Sun Run\n\nAs thousands of runners take to streets on Sunday for the return of The Vancouver Sun Run, a number of streets along the 10-kilometre race route will be closed to traffic.\n\nThe closures near Cambie Bridge and Pacific Boulevard \u2014 areas near the finish line and the mini-Sun Run route \u2014 start at 5 a.m., while closures near the Granville Bridge, Burrard Bridge and Georgia Street into the West End start at 8 to 8:30 a.m.\n\nCLICK HERE for a map of the road closures. For a complete list, click here.\n\nHow to get to the Sun Run\n\nTake transit. TransLink, including SkyTrain, SeaBus and certain bus routes, opens early on race day.\n\nAll major TransLink bus services run Sunday morning. SeaBus will sail from Lonsdale Quay at 7:02 a.m. (an hour earlier than normal) and provide a 15-minute service through the morning and early afternoon. SkyTrain will start service on the Expo/Millennium Lines half an hour earlier than normal, with the first train leaving King George at 6:38 a.m., Lafarge Lake-Douglas at 6:26 a.m., and Waterfront at 7:20 a.m. SkyTrain will operate \u201crush hour\u201d level service during the time prior to the start and into the afternoon, as crowds head home. Once again, Canada Line will launch at its usual time of 5:02 a.m. leaving Richmond-Brighouse to Waterfront Station, with extra service for incoming crowds starting at 7 a.m.\n\nCoast Mountain Bus will have a number of reroutes in effect, taking the buses away from Georgia between Pender and Richards, the West End, Granville Street downtown, Burrard Bridge, Cambie Bridge and 2nd Avenue in Kitsilano. Buses that normally use Georgia will travel along Pender between Cardero and Richards. Full details on the reroutes may be found online at translink.ca/alerts.\n\nWest Vancouver Blue Bus will also operate the usual Sunday schedule, but add service between West Van and downtown before and after the run. West Van buses that normally use Georgia will travel along Pender between Cardero and Richards.\n\nTo avoid line ups, pre-pay your fare with FareCards or FareSavers. Those coming on SkyTrain can purchase two tickets at the station in the morning when they\u2019re coming in and saving one of those tickets for the trip home.\n\nPlease move down the aisle to make more room for your fellow SunRunners if the bus or train is crowded.\n\nGood morning! Looks like it\u2019s gonna be a bright sunny day today! Just in time for the Vancouver #SunRun \ud83c\udf1e It\u2019ll be a busy one out in the Vancouver area. We have detours posted at https://t.co/SdIn7mtf5v #knowbeforeyougo ^LA \u2014 TransLink BC (@TransLink) April 24, 2022\n\nFalse Creek Ferries and Aquabus Ferries will also be running extra ferries on Sun Run morning, visit www.granvilleislandferries.bc.ca and theaquabus.com for schedules and fares.\n\nIf you must drive, you\u2019re advised to arrive by 7 a.m. Street parking in the area of the run is very limited (and remember, there is a 30-minute to two-hour limit to metered parking). A number of streets, both at the start line and along the route (click here for more info on road closures). There\u2019s some paid parking adjacent to B.C. Place Stadium, near the finish line. Seasoned Sun Runners park near the finish zone and jog back to the start zone.\n\nSun Runners who plan to cycle to the start line have the option to secure their bicycle with BEST (Better Environmentally Sound Transportation), The Bicycle Valet. Space to park 100 bikes will be available at B.C. Place\u2019s Gate C.\n\nReady, Set, Go! \ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\nToday is the day - make sure you know your race time and we\u2019re patiently waiting for you at the starting line.\ud83c\udfc1\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions before, during and after the race - feel free to send us a message so we can assist you on the fly!\n\n\n\nGood luck racers \ud83e\udd73 pic.twitter.com/k4400iria8 \u2014 Vancouver Sun Run (@VancouverSunRun) April 24, 2022\n\nHow to watch from the sidelines\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a runner, a jogger, or a walker to have fun. Invite family and friends to watch the race from the sidelines, and join in the fun and festivities on the course and at the finish line. The party starts at B.C. Place Stadium at 8:30 a.m., just in time to entertain the Shaw Mini Sun Runners and the first of the elite runners crossing the finish line at about 9:30 a.m. There will be snacks, samples and entertainment for everyone.\n\nAt 11 a.m., presentations will be made to the top finishers and the top Canadians, both male and female, and to the winners of the masters and wheelchair divisions.

Try refreshing your browser, or Jordan Romano gives up two-run walkoff homer in Houston, spoiling Gurriel's clutch effort Back to video And the Blue Jays left fielder was that close to claiming some significant bragging rights over his Astros first baseman bro on Sunday at Minute Maid Park. A home run in the fifth inning and a clutch RBI double in the top of the 10th by Lourdes appeared to have the Jays headed for their first series sweep of the season \u2014 and against the reigning American League champs at that.\n\nAnd with the Gurriels\u2019 Cuban parents watching from the stands, Lourdes had risen to the moment. But before he could celebrate, normally unflappable Jays closer Jordan Romano gave up a two-run homer to rookie Jeremy Pena in the bottom half of the 10th as the Astros walked it off for an 8-7 win.\n\nArticle content \u201cIt was due to happen,\u201d manager Charlie Montoyo said of Romano\u2019s miscue that allowed Pena to take him to the deepest part of centre field for the winning blow in the Jays\u2019 first extra-innings game of the season. \u201cGive the hitter credit for going deep to centre. (Romano) struck out the first guy. It\u2019s tough to save a game when you have a guy at second.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Though the clutch walkoff rocket was the deciding blow \u2014 and Romano\u2019s first blown save not just of the season, but in his past 32 attempts \u2014 the game had several wild swings of emotion and momentum.\n\nInconsistent Jays starter Yusei Kikuchi had trouble throwing strikes early on \u2014 walking five \u2014 and got himself into some trouble in the second when the Astros scored a pair of runs. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or The defence that had been so strong for the Jays in he early portion off the season turned sloppy on Sunday with errors from shortstop Bo Bichette and first baseman Cavan Biggio leading to three unearned Astros runs. \u201cIt goes back to what I always say: Playing games against good teams, if you play clean games, you usually have a chance,\u201d said Montoyo, who on Saturday won the 200th game of his big league managerial career. \u201cThe two games we didn\u2019t play clean this year, we\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content On the other hand, the Jays showed the grit that has defined them through a 10-6 run thus far in the season. Sandwiched between the two Gurriel RBIs was a three-run homer from catcher Zack Collins in the sixth inning that tied the game at 5-5. And not only was the game headed for extras, but a fourth Jays outing in a row decided by one run. \u201cObviously in that situation, you\u2019re looking for one thing and that\u2019s not to hit a single,\u201d Collins said of his third round-tripper of the season, a welcome bit of power for an offence not yet producing at its best. \u201cYou\u2019re looking to hit a homer. The coach had confidence in me, I got the pitch to do it, took the hack and got it done.\u201d After trading runs in the seventh, the game was headed to extras where Gurriel kept up his big afternoon with a clutch one-out double to the corner.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content With mom and dad and big brother looking on, it was clear how much the hit meant to Gurriel as he celebrated when he reached the bag at second. Prior to the series, Gurriel had talked about how much the series meant to the brothers, who talk most days anyway, but would be heavily dissecting each of these contests. \u201cWe have to win this series,\u201d Lourdes said, emphasizing the rivalry between the two brothers, which was accentuated by a pair of doubles from Yuli on Sunday. Well, they did win the series, just didn\u2019t get the sweep. Altogether, though, it was a successful six-game swing through Boston and Houston as the Jays got the better of each high-end opponent. \u201cThere are obviously positives we can take from it,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe played two good teams on the road and we have two major injuries with (Danny) Jansen and (Teoscar Hernandez) and a lot of guys have stepped up.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cTough loss today, but going home 4-2 is pretty good.\u201d KIKUCHI STRUGGLES For the second time in his three starts, lefty Kikuchi had a subpar outing and once again didn\u2019t make it out of the fourth inning. He threw just 43 of his 75 pitches for strikes, walking five and allowing three hits. \u201cHe\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Montoyo said of his team\u2019s fifth starter. \u201cI like his arm. I like how he competes, but it was a tough game because he walked five guys. \u201cPlaying tough teams, you can\u2019t walk that many guys.\u201d AROUND THE BASES A pair of singles from Vlad Guerrero Jr. gives him eight multi-hit games on the season and three in a row \u2026 Jays reliever Yimi Garcia had a visitor prior to the game when Houston manager Dusty Baker dropped by to present the former Astros pitcher with his 2021 ALCS championship ring \u2026 The Jays returned home after Sunday\u2019s game for what will be their longest home stand of the season \u2014 a 10-gamer starting with four against the Boston Red Sox followed by three against the Astros and three against the New York Yankees \u2026 Jose Berrios gets the ball for Monday\u2019s opener against the Sox followed by Kevin Gausman, Ross Stripling and Alek Manoah.\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nYour Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

Some more thoughts: \u2014 Young was outstanding pretty much from the moment he checked in. The Raptors might still regret moving down on draft night in order to land Young if they miss out on a prospect they love, but at least they know they don\u2019t win this game if they don\u2019t make that deal. They\u2019ll need more from Young the rest of the way. On defence he provides a nice, different look to throw at Embiid. On offence he\u2019s another big man that can confidently act as a secondary ball-handler to take pressure off Siakam/Barnes/Anunoby/Achiuwa if VanVleet isn\u2019t available or remains limited.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u2014 Toronto\u2019s now 8-0 in the playoffs when Siakam scores at least 25 points and went 12-2 this regular season when he scored at least 30. \u2014 Toronto won its seventh straight Game 4 of a playoff series. \u2014 I thought Khem Birch provided six solid minutes to start the game. He had three rebounds in that time and helped hold Embiid off early. Birch was part of the reason Embiid looked awful early, as he missed his first five shots. Still, Birch never got back into the game. We didn\u2019t ask about it afterward because there was a lot more to talk about, but would imagine his offensive limitations were the reason why. With no point guard available in the second half (VanVleet was out and Malachi Flynn and Dalano Banton just aren\u2019t ready yet for these stakes) they needed a big who could handle the ball a bit. That meant either Siakam, Barnes, Anunoby, Young or Achiuwa. Or they needed a shooting threat (like Boucher). Plus Birch gets almost all his offence of pick-and-rolls with VanVleet or on put-backs. Without VanVleet (or Kyle Lowry before that), Birch won\u2019t get his needed short push shots or layups or alley-oops.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u2014 Barnes winning rookie of the year was a different experience compared to the first two Raptors winners.

Carter got 113 of 118 first-place votes and his win was never in doubt. Barnes took a different path, slow and steady with a strong finish, to overtake Evan Mobley.

The UBC group Generation Squeeze is headed-up by Professor Paul Kershaw. His team released a CMHC-funded report in January that called for a surtax on the sale of primary residences in Canada. Documents obtained by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation show that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has poured an additional $200,000 in taxpayers\u2019 money into the report that\u2019s pushing for a big home equity tax. Taxing the sale of homes that Canadians own and live in has been off-limits since the 1970s, but this UBC group is set on changing that. The recommendations in its report include targeting the \u201chousing wealth windfalls gained by many home owners while they sleep and watch TV.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Outlets such as Blacklocks Reporter and the CTF have been sounding the alarm about a home equity tax for more than a year and each time it\u2019s raised, the Trudeau government and CMHC have called it \u201chorrible reporting.\u201d So why are the feds dumping our money into a group that\u2019s committed to making exactly that happen? CMHC had given $250,000 to Generation Squeeze to put together its report. And now CMHC confirmed it set aside another $200,000 for the project.

That\u2019s like buying a backyard swimming pool when your apartment is on the 10th floor. At best this is a frivolous waste of $450,000 in taxpayers\u2019 money.

In response, Tassi\u2019s staff wrote: \u201cThere will be no primary residence capital gains tax applied. This is a false rumour that has been floated for a while. It is simply not true.\u201d This CTF supporter tends toward tenacity and raised the obvious question: if this is a false rumour, why does the government keep funding the report? Here\u2019s what Tassi\u2019s office wrote in response: \u201cCMHC is not responsible for the views and proposals included the lab\u2019s final report.\u201d CMHC spent nearly half a million dollars on a report that pushes a home equity tax, but it bears no responsibility for that report? Tassi will have to forgive taxpayers who have trouble swallowing that line. Here\u2019s another burning question. If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau isn\u2019t planning on hitting Canadians with a home equity tax, why does his government require homeowners to report how much they made on the sale of their homes to the Canada Revenue Agency? Canadians can be forgiven for being skeptical, especially when it\u2019s their home\u2019s equity at stake.

Twitter\u2019s board is expected to find that Musk\u2019s all-cash $54.20 per share offer for the company is too low by the time it reports quarterly earnings on Thursday. Nonetheless, some shareholders who agree with that stance still want Twitter to seek a better offer from Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $270 billion, the sources told Reuters.\n\nArticle content One option available to Twitter\u2019s board is to open its books to Musk to try to coax him to sweeten his bid. Another would be to solicit offers from other potential bidders. While it is not yet clear which path Twitter will take, it is increasingly likely that its board will attempt to solicit a better offer from Musk even as it rebuffs the current one, the sources said.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to wake up next week and see Musk raise what he called his best and final offer to possibly $64.20 per share,\u201d one of the fund managers who is invested in Twitter said on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with the company. \u201cHe could also drop the whole thing entirely. Anything is possible,\u201d the fund manager said about Musk\u2019s offer. Twitter shares closed at $48.93 on Friday, a significant discount to Musk\u2019s offer that reflects the uncertainty over his bid\u2019s fate. Twitter adopted a poison pill after Musk made his offer to prevent him from raising his more than 9% stake in the company above 15% without negotiating a deal with its board. In response, Musk has threatened to launch a tender offer that he could use to register Twitter shareholder support for his bid.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.

While the poison pill would prevent Twitter shareholders from tendering their shares, the company is worried that its negotiating hand would weaken considerably if it was shown to be going against the will of many of its investors, the sources added. Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc , has been meeting with Twitter shareholders since he unveiled his offer on April 14, seeking support for his bid.

Short term-minded investors such as hedge funds want Twitter to accept Musk\u2019s offer or ask for only a small increase, the sources said.

Try refreshing your browser, or Rideshare companies in Canada that provide insurance Back to video The global ridesharing market is expected to climb from US$21.42 billion in 2020 to US$61.24 billion in 2026. For the drivers, these apps are advertised as an easy way to make some extra cash. But when it comes to car insurance, drivers need to make sure they have adequate coverage. Do rideshare companies provide insurance for their drivers? Luckily, it appears that most ridesharing companies offer auto insurance coverage, just as long as the ridesharing app is turned on. Once a ridesharing app is closed, the driver\u2019s insurance defaults to their own personal policy. According to Russ Courtney, senior media relations and digital officer at the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA), the FSRA is not currently aware of any ridesharing apps that don\u2019t have coverage. Nonetheless, the onus is still on drivers to look up what coverage is available to them, and any finer details about that coverage.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cIf it is discovered that a ridesharing company does not have coverage, drivers and vehicle owners need to be aware that there may be serious gaps in coverage and they should contact their own insurance provider to discuss those gaps and risks before continuing to drive for that company,\u201d Courtney says. \u201c[The] FSRA also suggests reporting to the municipality where the company is operating.\u201d Even if you are covered by a ridesharing app\u2019s insurance provider, it\u2019s still critical to inform your personal insurance company that you\u2019re using your vehicle for commercial purposes. That\u2019s especially true if you don\u2019t have full ownership of the vehicle. \u201cIf your vehicle is leased or rented you may not be allowed to carry paying passengers, so it\u2019s best to carefully review your lease or rental agreement,\u201d Courtney says. \u201cYou may also want to contact your leasing and car rental company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content How working for a rideshare company can impact your personal insurance Whether or not working for a rideshare company would impact your own personal policy or premium depends on the company . Courtney says this would vary by insurance company, so you\u2019ll need to check with your provider, agent, or broker. You\u2019ll also want to check that you have the right amount of coverage through a ridesharing company. \u201cNot having enough could mean your losses are not covered,\u201d Courtney says. Your personal auto insurance coverage may not be the same as what the ridesharing company\u2019s policy is offering. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to carefully review the coverages provided and speak with your own insurance provider if needed, he adds.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Notably, most coverage appears to start at $1 million third-party liability, include standard accident benefits, and have a $1,000 deductible for all perils, collision, comprehensive or specific perils.

Bombardier was offering salary raises of 2.5 per cent for the first year, then 2.25 per cent for the last two years of a three-year collective agreement.\n\nArticle content In an interview with the Canadian Press, Eric Rancourt, a business agent at AIMTA\u2019s District 11, explained that the two parties were so far apart in salary matters that even before negotiations began on the topic, the union asked management to provide its best offer, which was then rejected almost unanimously.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cIt\u2019s well below the inflation we\u2019re experiencing at the moment, which is hitting new heights, and people are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not worth more than that?\u2019\u201c Rancourt said, adding that the workers expected Bombardier to return the favour for past concessions on their part. During the signing of the last collective agreement, which ended in December, the unionized employees felt they had made compromises on salary due to the difficult financial situation in which the company found itself. Now that things have improved, workers want to be rewarded.\n\nArticle content \u201cWe felt the frustration rising during the assembly,\u201d Rancourt said, \u201cbecause (the employees) don\u2019t feel valued now that things are going better at Bombardier.\u201d Bombardier said in a statement the company was \u201con the right track\u201d and it believed it had made an \u201cequitable\u201d offer for a new contract.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The workers\u2019 association also believes that improved working conditions would help Bombardier attract new talent, given the current work shortage and the fierce competition to recruit workers in the aerospace industry. Following the vote, the union informed management of the result and extended an invitation for the renewal of talks as quickly as possible at the beginning of the week.\n\nArticle content Rancourt added that on top of salary matters, discussions must continue on the topics of sub-contracting (internal and external) over the duration of the work contract, and of the indexation at the cost of living of retirees\u2019 pensions. Following the resounding refusal of the offer from management, the unionized employees accorded a strike mandate to their representatives with 98.8 per cent support. This mandate is not technically a strike vote, according to Rancourt. Should the union wish to make use of the strike mandate to decree strike days or even a general strike, it would have to call another general assembly to obtain approval from members. Local section 712 of AIMTA represents 1,800 Bombardier employees on the final assembly line in Dorval and at the manufacturing centre in St-Laurent.

Web links to longer stories if available.\n\n3:34 p.m.: Quebec is reporting 20 more deaths and a 27-patient drop in hospitalizations in the past 24 hours.\n\nHealth officials say 2,344 patients are hospitalized due to COVID-19, the second day in a row the province reported a decline after hitting a sixth-wave high of 2,410 patients on Friday.\n\nThe number of hospitalizations also dropped Saturday by 39 patients.\n\nThere were 90 patients listed in intensive care Sunday, an increase of one patient compared to the previous day.\n\nLast week, the province\u2019s interim public health director, Dr. Luc Boileau, said there were indications that community transmission was beginning to slow and new daily hospitalizations were trending down.\n\nBut Boileau announced mask mandates for indoor public spaces and public transit would remain in place until mid-May as the situation remains difficult despite promising signs.\n\nIn addition to 20 deaths on Sunday, authorities reported 34 deaths on Saturday attributed to COVID-19. The province has recorded 14,866 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n9:53 a.m.: The Ontario government\u2019s decision to extend its remaining mask mandate in high-risk settings like hospitals, long-term-care homes, shelters and public transit until at least June 11 is being met with mixed reactions.\n\nAndrew Williams, president and CEO of Huron Perth Healthcare Alliance, says his organization \u201cfully\u201d supports the move.\n\nHe says the organization decided to continue its mask mandate at the four hospitals it oversees \u201cindefinitely\u201d and that the government\u2019s extension \u201creally helped our messaging.\u201d\n\nDoris Grinspun, CEO of the Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario, says her association was calling for the province\u2019s mask mandate to be kept in all indoor settings to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases.\n\nBut with mask mandates already lifted in most indoor spaces like schools and retail stores, she says she would at least like to see mask requirements kept indefinitely in high-risk settings until public health indicators like COVID-19 hospitalizations \u201csignificantly\u201d improve.\n\nToronto resident Maria Elizondo, who commutes to work five days a week, says extending the mask mandate for public transit is \u201cgreat\u201d in theory, but is \u201cworthless\u201d in practice since mask-wearing is not being enforced on the TTC.\n\n7:13 a.m.: Israel has lifted an indoor mask mandate in place for nearly a year as the country\u2019s new cases of coronavirus continue to drop.\n\nThe end of the masking requirement took effect Saturday night. Masks remain mandatory in hospitals, elderly care facilities and on international flights.\n\nIsrael has seen new cases of COVID-19 drop since the peak of the latest wave of infections in January. Serious cases of coronavirus have plummeted from a high of over 1,200 during the omicron variant outbreak to around 200.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic two years ago, Israel has recorded over 4 million cases of coronavirus and at least 10,658 deaths \u2014 over one-fifth of them since January, according to the Health Ministry.\n\nOver 72% of the country\u2019s 9.4 million people have at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and nearly half have received three shots.\n\nSunday 7:11 a.m.: Volunteers and low-level government workers in Shanghai have erected metal barriers in multiple districts to block off small streets and entrances to apartment complexes, as China hardens its strict \u201czero-COVID\u201d approach in the metropolis.\n\nIn the city\u2019s financial district, Pudong, the barriers \u2014 either thin metal sheets or mesh fences \u2014 were put up in several neighbourhoods under a local government directive, according to Caixin, a Chinese business media outlet. Buildings where positive cases have been found sealed up their main entrances, with a small opening for pandemic prevention workers to pass through.\n\nRead Saturday\u2019s coronavirus news.\n\nSHARE:",

Now what?\n\nWell, you\u2019ve completed the Sun Run. Now it\u2019s time to collapse on the couch and give in to inertia, gravity, and snack food cravings.\n\nNot so, says Running Room CEO John Stanton.\n\n\u201cYou need to set a new goal. It gives you discipline. And you want to maintain the level of fitness you\u2019ve achieved, and build upon that.\u201d\n\nMost runners train for at least 10 weeks leading up to the race. \u201cIn that time, many people, especially if they\u2019re new to running, they will have seen a dramatic change in their overall level of fitness and confidence and mental well-being,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably sleeping better and they\u2019re probably eating better.\u201d\n\nTo maintain that level of fitness and even improve upon it he suggests making new goals, such as planning another 10k run.\n\n\u201cAnd set a target, such as a five-minute time goal. In other words, if you ran the Sun Run in 65 minutes, then your next race maybe you should try to break 60 minutes. And that five-minute increment or performance is what I call \u2018an intelligent goal.\u2019 It\u2019s slightly out of reach, but attainable.\u201d\n\nRead more of Stanton\u2019s pro advice here.\n\n\u2014 Shawn Conner\n\nGood weather for race day\n\nThe sun is shining on the Vancouver Sun Run, with temperatures set to hit a high of 16\u00baC.\n\nThe race day weather forecast is for a mix of sun and cloud, with 30 per cent chance of showers late this afternoon. Wind becoming southeast 20 km/h this morning. High 16. UV index 4 or moderate.\n\nRoad closures for the Sun Run\n\nAs thousands of runners take to streets on Sunday for the return of The Vancouver Sun Run, a number of streets along the 10-kilometre race route will be closed to traffic.\n\nThe closures near Cambie Bridge and Pacific Boulevard \u2014 areas near the finish line and the mini-Sun Run route \u2014 start at 5 a.m., while closures near the Granville Bridge, Burrard Bridge and Georgia Street into the West End start at 8 to 8:30 a.m.\n\nCLICK HERE for a map of the road closures. For a complete list, click here.\n\nHow to get to the Sun Run\n\nTake transit. TransLink, including SkyTrain, SeaBus and certain bus routes, opens early on race day.\n\nAll major TransLink bus services run Sunday morning. SeaBus will sail from Lonsdale Quay at 7:02 a.m. (an hour earlier than normal) and provide a 15-minute service through the morning and early afternoon. SkyTrain will start service on the Expo/Millennium Lines half an hour earlier than normal, with the first train leaving King George at 6:38 a.m., Lafarge Lake-Douglas at 6:26 a.m., and Waterfront at 7:20 a.m. SkyTrain will operate \u201crush hour\u201d level service during the time prior to the start and into the afternoon, as crowds head home. Once again, Canada Line will launch at its usual time of 5:02 a.m. leaving Richmond-Brighouse to Waterfront Station, with extra service for incoming crowds starting at 7 a.m.\n\nCoast Mountain Bus will have a number of reroutes in effect, taking the buses away from Georgia between Pender and Richards, the West End, Granville Street downtown, Burrard Bridge, Cambie Bridge and 2nd Avenue in Kitsilano. Buses that normally use Georgia will travel along Pender between Cardero and Richards. Full details on the reroutes may be found online at translink.ca/alerts.\n\nWest Vancouver Blue Bus will also operate the usual Sunday schedule, but add service between West Van and downtown before and after the run. West Van buses that normally use Georgia will travel along Pender between Cardero and Richards.\n\nTo avoid line ups, pre-pay your fare with FareCards or FareSavers. Those coming on SkyTrain can purchase two tickets at the station in the morning when they\u2019re coming in and saving one of those tickets for the trip home.\n\nPlease move down the aisle to make more room for your fellow SunRunners if the bus or train is crowded.\n\nGood morning! Looks like it\u2019s gonna be a bright sunny day today! Just in time for the Vancouver #SunRun \ud83c\udf1e It\u2019ll be a busy one out in the Vancouver area. We have detours posted at https://t.co/SdIn7mtf5v #knowbeforeyougo ^LA \u2014 TransLink BC (@TransLink) April 24, 2022\n\nFalse Creek Ferries and Aquabus Ferries will also be running extra ferries on Sun Run morning, visit www.granvilleislandferries.bc.ca and theaquabus.com for schedules and fares.\n\nIf you must drive, you\u2019re advised to arrive by 7 a.m. Street parking in the area of the run is very limited (and remember, there is a 30-minute to two-hour limit to metered parking). A number of streets, both at the start line and along the route (click here for more info on road closures). There\u2019s some paid parking adjacent to B.C. Place Stadium, near the finish line. Seasoned Sun Runners park near the finish zone and jog back to the start zone.\n\nSun Runners who plan to cycle to the start line have the option to secure their bicycle with BEST (Better Environmentally Sound Transportation), The Bicycle Valet. Space to park 100 bikes will be available at B.C. Place\u2019s Gate C.\n\nReady, Set, Go! \ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\nToday is the day - make sure you know your race time and we\u2019re patiently waiting for you at the starting line.\ud83c\udfc1\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions before, during and after the race - feel free to send us a message so we can assist you on the fly!\n\n\n\nGood luck racers \ud83e\udd73 pic.twitter.com/k4400iria8 \u2014 Vancouver Sun Run (@VancouverSunRun) April 24, 2022\n\nHow to watch from the sidelines\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a runner, a jogger, or a walker to have fun. Invite family and friends to watch the race from the sidelines, and join in the fun and festivities on the course and at the finish line. The party starts at B.C.

A home run in the fifth inning and a clutch RBI double in the top of the 10th by Lourdes appeared to have the Jays headed for their first series sweep of the season \u2014 and against the reigning American League champs at that.\n\nAnd with the Gurriels\u2019 Cuban parents watching from the stands, Lourdes had risen to the moment. But before he could celebrate, normally unflappable Jays closer Jordan Romano gave up a two-run homer to rookie Jeremy Pena in the bottom half of the 10th as the Astros walked it off for an 8-7 win.\n\nArticle content \u201cIt was due to happen,\u201d manager Charlie Montoyo said of Romano\u2019s miscue that allowed Pena to take him to the deepest part of centre field for the winning blow in the Jays\u2019 first extra-innings game of the season. \u201cGive the hitter credit for going deep to centre.

Sandwiched between the two Gurriel RBIs was a three-run homer from catcher Zack Collins in the sixth inning that tied the game at 5-5. And not only was the game headed for extras, but a fourth Jays outing in a row decided by one run. \u201cObviously in that situation, you\u2019re looking for one thing and that\u2019s not to hit a single,\u201d Collins said of his third round-tripper of the season, a welcome bit of power for an offence not yet producing at its best. \u201cYou\u2019re looking to hit a homer.

Prior to the series, Gurriel had talked about how much the series meant to the brothers, who talk most days anyway, but would be heavily dissecting each of these contests. \u201cWe have to win this series,\u201d Lourdes said, emphasizing the rivalry between the two brothers, which was accentuated by a pair of doubles from Yuli on Sunday. Well, they did win the series, just didn\u2019t get the sweep. Altogether, though, it was a successful six-game swing through Boston and Houston as the Jays got the better of each high-end opponent. \u201cThere are obviously positives we can take from it,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe played two good teams on the road and we have two major injuries with (Danny) Jansen and (Teoscar Hernandez) and a lot of guys have stepped up.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cTough loss today, but going home 4-2 is pretty good.\u201d KIKUCHI STRUGGLES For the second time in his three starts, lefty Kikuchi had a subpar outing and once again didn\u2019t make it out of the fourth inning. He threw just 43 of his 75 pitches for strikes, walking five and allowing three hits. \u201cHe\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Montoyo said of his team\u2019s fifth starter. \u201cI like his arm.

The UBC group Generation Squeeze is headed-up by Professor Paul Kershaw. His team released a CMHC-funded report in January that called for a surtax on the sale of primary residences in Canada. Documents obtained by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation show that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has poured an additional $200,000 in taxpayers\u2019 money into the report that\u2019s pushing for a big home equity tax. Taxing the sale of homes that Canadians own and live in has been off-limits since the 1970s, but this UBC group is set on changing that. The recommendations in its report include targeting the \u201chousing wealth windfalls gained by many home owners while they sleep and watch TV.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Outlets such as Blacklocks Reporter and the CTF have been sounding the alarm about a home equity tax for more than a year and each time it\u2019s raised, the Trudeau government and CMHC have called it \u201chorrible reporting.\u201d So why are the feds dumping our money into a group that\u2019s committed to making exactly that happen? CMHC had given $250,000 to Generation Squeeze to put together its report. And now CMHC confirmed it set aside another $200,000 for the project.

That\u2019s like buying a backyard swimming pool when your apartment is on the 10th floor. At best this is a frivolous waste of $450,000 in taxpayers\u2019 money. At worst, it\u2019s damning evidence that the Trudeau government is trying to tunnel taxes out of Canadians\u2019 homes.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content On Nov. 17, 2021, Kershaw emailed Debbie Stewart at CMHC, according to records obtained by CTF\u2019s investigative reporter, James Wood.

In response, Tassi\u2019s staff wrote: \u201cThere will be no primary residence capital gains tax applied. This is a false rumour that has been floated for a while. It is simply not true.\u201d This CTF supporter tends toward tenacity and raised the obvious question: if this is a false rumour, why does the government keep funding the report? Here\u2019s what Tassi\u2019s office wrote in response: \u201cCMHC is not responsible for the views and proposals included the lab\u2019s final report.\u201d CMHC spent nearly half a million dollars on a report that pushes a home equity tax, but it bears no responsibility for that report? Tassi will have to forgive taxpayers who have trouble swallowing that line. Here\u2019s another burning question. If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau isn\u2019t planning on hitting Canadians with a home equity tax, why does his government require homeowners to report how much they made on the sale of their homes to the Canada Revenue Agency? Canadians can be forgiven for being skeptical, especially when it\u2019s their home\u2019s equity at stake.

Try refreshing your browser, or Twitter under shareholder pressure to seek deal with Elon Musk, sources say Back to video While the views of Twitter shareholders vary over what a fair price for a deal would be, many reached out to the company after Musk outlined his acquisition financing plan on Thursday and urged it not to let the opportunity for a deal slip away, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Twitter\u2019s board is expected to find that Musk\u2019s all-cash $54.20 per share offer for the company is too low by the time it reports quarterly earnings on Thursday. Nonetheless, some shareholders who agree with that stance still want Twitter to seek a better offer from Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $270 billion, the sources told Reuters.\n\nArticle content One option available to Twitter\u2019s board is to open its books to Musk to try to coax him to sweeten his bid. Another would be to solicit offers from other potential bidders. While it is not yet clear which path Twitter will take, it is increasingly likely that its board will attempt to solicit a better offer from Musk even as it rebuffs the current one, the sources said.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to wake up next week and see Musk raise what he called his best and final offer to possibly $64.20 per share,\u201d one of the fund managers who is invested in Twitter said on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with the company. \u201cHe could also drop the whole thing entirely. Anything is possible,\u201d the fund manager said about Musk\u2019s offer. Twitter shares closed at $48.93 on Friday, a significant discount to Musk\u2019s offer that reflects the uncertainty over his bid\u2019s fate. Twitter adopted a poison pill after Musk made his offer to prevent him from raising his more than 9% stake in the company above 15% without negotiating a deal with its board. In response, Musk has threatened to launch a tender offer that he could use to register Twitter shareholder support for his bid.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.

While the poison pill would prevent Twitter shareholders from tendering their shares, the company is worried that its negotiating hand would weaken considerably if it was shown to be going against the will of many of its investors, the sources added. Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc , has been meeting with Twitter shareholders since he unveiled his offer on April 14, seeking support for his bid.

Short term-minded investors such as hedge funds want Twitter to accept Musk\u2019s offer or ask for only a small increase, the sources said.

Try refreshing your browser, or Rideshare companies in Canada that provide insurance Back to video The global ridesharing market is expected to climb from US$21.42 billion in 2020 to US$61.24 billion in 2026. For the drivers, these apps are advertised as an easy way to make some extra cash. But when it comes to car insurance, drivers need to make sure they have adequate coverage. Do rideshare companies provide insurance for their drivers? Luckily, it appears that most ridesharing companies offer auto insurance coverage, just as long as the ridesharing app is turned on. Once a ridesharing app is closed, the driver\u2019s insurance defaults to their own personal policy. According to Russ Courtney, senior media relations and digital officer at the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA), the FSRA is not currently aware of any ridesharing apps that don\u2019t have coverage. Nonetheless, the onus is still on drivers to look up what coverage is available to them, and any finer details about that coverage.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cIf it is discovered that a ridesharing company does not have coverage, drivers and vehicle owners need to be aware that there may be serious gaps in coverage and they should contact their own insurance provider to discuss those gaps and risks before continuing to drive for that company,\u201d Courtney says. \u201c[The] FSRA also suggests reporting to the municipality where the company is operating.\u201d Even if you are covered by a ridesharing app\u2019s insurance provider, it\u2019s still critical to inform your personal insurance company that you\u2019re using your vehicle for commercial purposes. That\u2019s especially true if you don\u2019t have full ownership of the vehicle. \u201cIf your vehicle is leased or rented you may not be allowed to carry paying passengers, so it\u2019s best to carefully review your lease or rental agreement,\u201d Courtney says. \u201cYou may also want to contact your leasing and car rental company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content How working for a rideshare company can impact your personal insurance Whether or not working for a rideshare company would impact your own personal policy or premium depends on the company . Courtney says this would vary by insurance company, so you\u2019ll need to check with your provider, agent, or broker. You\u2019ll also want to check that you have the right amount of coverage through a ridesharing company. \u201cNot having enough could mean your losses are not covered,\u201d Courtney says. Your personal auto insurance coverage may not be the same as what the ridesharing company\u2019s policy is offering. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to carefully review the coverages provided and speak with your own insurance provider if needed, he adds.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Notably, most coverage appears to start at $1 million third-party liability, include standard accident benefits, and have a $1,000 deductible for all perils, collision, comprehensive or specific perils.

Le Pen wants a nationalist alliance in a move that raises the prospect of her working with rival far-rightists like Eric Zemmour and her niece, Marion Marechal.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.

Initial polling showed the vote was sharply split both by age and socio-economic status: Two-thirds of working class voters backed le Pen, while similar proportions of white-collar executives and pensioners backed Macron, an Elabe poll showed. Macron won around 59% of votes by 18-24 year-olds with the vote almost evenly split in other age categories. During the campaign, Le Pen homed in on the rising cost of living and Macron\u2019s sometimes abrasive style as some of his weakest points.\n\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content She promised sharp cuts to fuel tax, zero-percent sales tax on essential items from pasta to diapers, income exemptions for young workers and a \u201cFrench first\u201d stance on jobs and welfare. \u201cI\u2019m shocked to see that a majority of French people want to reelect a president that looked down on them for five years,\u201d Adrien Caligiuri, a 27-year-old project manager said at the Le Pen rally. Macron meanwhile pointed to Le Pen\u2019s past admiration for Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin as showing she could not be trusted on the world stage, while insisting she still harboured plans to pull France out of the European Union \u2013 something she denies.\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nYour Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

According to a statement released by AIMTA, the salary offers were not acceptable to the workers. Bombardier was offering salary raises of 2.5 per cent for the first year, then 2.25 per cent for the last two years of a three-year collective agreement.\n\nArticle content In an interview with the Canadian Press, Eric Rancourt, a business agent at AIMTA\u2019s District 11, explained that the two parties were so far apart in salary matters that even before negotiations began on the topic, the union asked management to provide its best offer, which was then rejected almost unanimously.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cIt\u2019s well below the inflation we\u2019re experiencing at the moment, which is hitting new heights, and people are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not worth more than that?\u2019\u201c Rancourt said, adding that the workers expected Bombardier to return the favour for past concessions on their part. During the signing of the last collective agreement, which ended in December, the unionized employees felt they had made compromises on salary due to the difficult financial situation in which the company found itself. Now that things have improved, workers want to be rewarded.\n\nArticle content \u201cWe felt the frustration rising during the assembly,\u201d Rancourt said, \u201cbecause (the employees) don\u2019t feel valued now that things are going better at Bombardier.\u201d Bombardier said in a statement the company was \u201con the right track\u201d and it believed it had made an \u201cequitable\u201d offer for a new contract.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content The workers\u2019 association also believes that improved working conditions would help Bombardier attract new talent, given the current work shortage and the fierce competition to recruit workers in the aerospace industry. Following the vote, the union informed management of the result and extended an invitation for the renewal of talks as quickly as possible at the beginning of the week.\n\nArticle content Rancourt added that on top of salary matters, discussions must continue on the topics of sub-contracting (internal and external) over the duration of the work contract, and of the indexation at the cost of living of retirees\u2019 pensions. Following the resounding refusal of the offer from management, the unionized employees accorded a strike mandate to their representatives with 98.8 per cent support. This mandate is not technically a strike vote, according to Rancourt. Should the union wish to make use of the strike mandate to decree strike days or even a general strike, it would have to call another general assembly to obtain approval from members. Local section 712 of AIMTA represents 1,800 Bombardier employees on the final assembly line in Dorval and at the manufacturing centre in St-Laurent.

The province has recorded 14,866 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n9:53 a.m.: The Ontario government\u2019s decision to extend its remaining mask mandate in high-risk settings like hospitals, long-term-care homes, shelters and public transit until at least June 11 is being met with mixed reactions.\n\nAndrew Williams, president and CEO of Huron Perth Healthcare Alliance, says his organization \u201cfully\u201d supports the move.\n\nHe says the organization decided to continue its mask mandate at the four hospitals it oversees \u201cindefinitely\u201d and that the government\u2019s extension \u201creally helped our messaging.\u201d\n\nDoris Grinspun, CEO of the Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario, says her association was calling for the province\u2019s mask mandate to be kept in all indoor settings to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases.\n\nBut with mask mandates already lifted in most indoor spaces like schools and retail stores, she says she would at least like to see mask requirements kept indefinitely in high-risk settings until public health indicators like COVID-19 hospitalizations \u201csignificantly\u201d improve.\n\nToronto resident Maria Elizondo, who commutes to work five days a week, says extending the mask mandate for public transit is \u201cgreat\u201d in theory, but is \u201cworthless\u201d in practice since mask-wearing is not being enforced on the TTC.\n\n7:13 a.m.: Israel has lifted an indoor mask mandate in place for nearly a year as the country\u2019s new cases of coronavirus continue to drop.\n\nThe end of the masking requirement took effect Saturday night. Masks remain mandatory in hospitals, elderly care facilities and on international flights.\n\nIsrael has seen new cases of COVID-19 drop since the peak of the latest wave of infections in January. Serious cases of coronavirus have plummeted from a high of over 1,200 during the omicron variant outbreak to around 200.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic two years ago, Israel has recorded over 4 million cases of coronavirus and at least 10,658 deaths \u2014 over one-fifth of them since January, according to the Health Ministry.\n\nOver 72% of the country\u2019s 9.4 million people have at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and nearly half have received three shots.\n\nSunday 7:11 a.m.: Volunteers and low-level government workers in Shanghai have erected metal barriers in multiple districts to block off small streets and entrances to apartment complexes, as China hardens its strict \u201czero-COVID\u201d approach in the metropolis.\n\nIn the city\u2019s financial district, Pudong, the barriers \u2014 either thin metal sheets or mesh fences \u2014 were put up in several neighbourhoods under a local government directive, according to Caixin, a Chinese business media outlet.

Thanks to all our volunteers and sponsors who made this day possible! pic.twitter.com/uuMIITSqss\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nYou\u2019ve just complete the Sun Run. Now what?\n\nWell, you\u2019ve completed the Sun Run. Now it\u2019s time to collapse on the couch and give in to inertia, gravity, and snack food cravings.\n\nNot so, says Running Room CEO John Stanton.\n\n\u201cYou need to set a new goal. It gives you discipline. And you want to maintain the level of fitness you\u2019ve achieved, and build upon that.\u201d\n\nMost runners train for at least 10 weeks leading up to the race. \u201cIn that time, many people, especially if they\u2019re new to running, they will have seen a dramatic change in their overall level of fitness and confidence and mental well-being,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably sleeping better and they\u2019re probably eating better.\u201d\n\nTo maintain that level of fitness and even improve upon it he suggests making new goals, such as planning another 10k run.\n\n\u201cAnd set a target, such as a five-minute time goal. In other words, if you ran the Sun Run in 65 minutes, then your next race maybe you should try to break 60 minutes. And that five-minute increment or performance is what I call \u2018an intelligent goal.\u2019 It\u2019s slightly out of reach, but attainable.\u201d\n\nRead more of Stanton\u2019s pro advice here.\n\n\u2014 Shawn Conner\n\nGood weather for race day\n\nThe sun is shining on the Vancouver Sun Run, with temperatures set to hit a high of 16\u00baC.\n\nThe race day weather forecast is for a mix of sun and cloud, with 30 per cent chance of showers late this afternoon. Wind becoming southeast 20 km/h this morning. High 16. UV index 4 or moderate.\n\nRoad closures for the Sun Run\n\nAs thousands of runners take to streets on Sunday for the return of The Vancouver Sun Run, a number of streets along the 10-kilometre race route will be closed to traffic.\n\nThe closures near Cambie Bridge and Pacific Boulevard \u2014 areas near the finish line and the mini-Sun Run route \u2014 start at 5 a.m., while closures near the Granville Bridge, Burrard Bridge and Georgia Street into the West End start at 8 to 8:30 a.m.\n\nCLICK HERE for a map of the road closures. For a complete list, click here.\n\nHow to get to the Sun Run\n\nTake transit. TransLink, including SkyTrain, SeaBus and certain bus routes, opens early on race day.\n\nAll major TransLink bus services run Sunday morning. SeaBus will sail from Lonsdale Quay at 7:02 a.m. (an hour earlier than normal) and provide a 15-minute service through the morning and early afternoon. SkyTrain will start service on the Expo/Millennium Lines half an hour earlier than normal, with the first train leaving King George at 6:38 a.m., Lafarge Lake-Douglas at 6:26 a.m., and Waterfront at 7:20 a.m. SkyTrain will operate \u201crush hour\u201d level service during the time prior to the start and into the afternoon, as crowds head home. Once again, Canada Line will launch at its usual time of 5:02 a.m. leaving Richmond-Brighouse to Waterfront Station, with extra service for incoming crowds starting at 7 a.m.\n\nCoast Mountain Bus will have a number of reroutes in effect, taking the buses away from Georgia between Pender and Richards, the West End, Granville Street downtown, Burrard Bridge, Cambie Bridge and 2nd Avenue in Kitsilano. Buses that normally use Georgia will travel along Pender between Cardero and Richards. Full details on the reroutes may be found online at translink.ca/alerts.\n\nWest Vancouver Blue Bus will also operate the usual Sunday schedule, but add service between West Van and downtown before and after the run. West Van buses that normally use Georgia will travel along Pender between Cardero and Richards.\n\nTo avoid line ups, pre-pay your fare with FareCards or FareSavers. Those coming on SkyTrain can purchase two tickets at the station in the morning when they\u2019re coming in and saving one of those tickets for the trip home.\n\nPlease move down the aisle to make more room for your fellow SunRunners if the bus or train is crowded.\n\nGood morning! Looks like it\u2019s gonna be a bright sunny day today! Just in time for the Vancouver #SunRun \ud83c\udf1e It\u2019ll be a busy one out in the Vancouver area. We have detours posted at https://t.co/SdIn7mtf5v #knowbeforeyougo ^LA \u2014 TransLink BC (@TransLink) April 24, 2022\n\nFalse Creek Ferries and Aquabus Ferries will also be running extra ferries on Sun Run morning, visit www.granvilleislandferries.bc.ca and theaquabus.com for schedules and fares.\n\nIf you must drive, you\u2019re advised to arrive by 7 a.m. Street parking in the area of the run is very limited (and remember, there is a 30-minute to two-hour limit to metered parking). A number of streets, both at the start line and along the route (click here for more info on road closures). There\u2019s some paid parking adjacent to B.C. Place Stadium, near the finish line. Seasoned Sun Runners park near the finish zone and jog back to the start zone.\n\nSun Runners who plan to cycle to the start line have the option to secure their bicycle with BEST (Better Environmentally Sound Transportation), The Bicycle Valet. Space to park 100 bikes will be available at B.C. Place\u2019s Gate C.\n\nReady, Set, Go! \ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\nToday is the day - make sure you know your race time and we\u2019re patiently waiting for you at the starting line.\ud83c\udfc1\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions before, during and after the race - feel free to send us a message so we can assist you on the fly!\n\n\n\nGood luck racers \ud83e\udd73 pic.twitter.com/k4400iria8 \u2014 Vancouver Sun Run (@VancouverSunRun) April 24, 2022\n\nHow to watch from the sidelines\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a runner, a jogger, or a walker to have fun. Invite family and friends to watch the race from the sidelines, and join in the fun and festivities on the course and at the finish line. The party starts at B.C. Place Stadium at 8:30 a.m., just in time to entertain the Shaw Mini Sun Runners and the first of the elite runners crossing the finish line at about 9:30 a.m. There will be snacks, samples and entertainment for everyone.\n\nAt 11 a.m., presentations will be made to the top finishers and the top Canadians, both male and female, and to the winners of the masters and wheelchair divisions.

Try refreshing your browser, or Jordan Romano gives up two-run walkoff homer in Houston, spoiling Gurriel's clutch effort Back to video And the Blue Jays left fielder was that close to claiming some significant bragging rights over his Astros first baseman bro on Sunday at Minute Maid Park. A home run in the fifth inning and a clutch RBI double in the top of the 10th by Lourdes appeared to have the Jays headed for their first series sweep of the season \u2014 and against the reigning American League champs at that.\n\nAnd with the Gurriels\u2019 Cuban parents watching from the stands, Lourdes had risen to the moment. But before he could celebrate, normally unflappable Jays closer Jordan Romano gave up a two-run homer to rookie Jeremy Pena in the bottom half of the 10th as the Astros walked it off for an 8-7 win.\n\nArticle content \u201cIt was due to happen,\u201d manager Charlie Montoyo said of Romano\u2019s miscue that allowed Pena to take him to the deepest part of centre field for the winning blow in the Jays\u2019 first extra-innings game of the season. \u201cGive the hitter credit for going deep to centre. (Romano) struck out the first guy. It\u2019s tough to save a game when you have a guy at second.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Though the clutch walkoff rocket was the deciding blow \u2014 and Romano\u2019s first blown save not just of the season, but in his past 32 attempts \u2014 the game had several wild swings of emotion and momentum.\n\nInconsistent Jays starter Yusei Kikuchi had trouble throwing strikes early on \u2014 walking five \u2014 and got himself into some trouble in the second when the Astros scored a pair of runs. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or The defence that had been so strong for the Jays in he early portion off the season turned sloppy on Sunday with errors from shortstop Bo Bichette and first baseman Cavan Biggio leading to three unearned Astros runs. \u201cIt goes back to what I always say: Playing games against good teams, if you play clean games, you usually have a chance,\u201d said Montoyo, who on Saturday won the 200th game of his big league managerial career. \u201cThe two games we didn\u2019t play clean this year, we\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content On the other hand, the Jays showed the grit that has defined them through a 10-6 run thus far in the season. Sandwiched between the two Gurriel RBIs was a three-run homer from catcher Zack Collins in the sixth inning that tied the game at 5-5. And not only was the game headed for extras, but a fourth Jays outing in a row decided by one run. \u201cObviously in that situation, you\u2019re looking for one thing and that\u2019s not to hit a single,\u201d Collins said of his third round-tripper of the season, a welcome bit of power for an offence not yet producing at its best. \u201cYou\u2019re looking to hit a homer. The coach had confidence in me, I got the pitch to do it, took the hack and got it done.\u201d After trading runs in the seventh, the game was headed to extras where Gurriel kept up his big afternoon with a clutch one-out double to the corner.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content With mom and dad and big brother looking on, it was clear how much the hit meant to Gurriel as he celebrated when he reached the bag at second. Prior to the series, Gurriel had talked about how much the series meant to the brothers, who talk most days anyway, but would be heavily dissecting each of these contests. \u201cWe have to win this series,\u201d Lourdes said, emphasizing the rivalry between the two brothers, which was accentuated by a pair of doubles from Yuli on Sunday. Well, they did win the series, just didn\u2019t get the sweep. Altogether, though, it was a successful six-game swing through Boston and Houston as the Jays got the better of each high-end opponent. \u201cThere are obviously positives we can take from it,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe played two good teams on the road and we have two major injuries with (Danny) Jansen and (Teoscar Hernandez) and a lot of guys have stepped up.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cTough loss today, but going home 4-2 is pretty good.\u201d KIKUCHI STRUGGLES For the second time in his three starts, lefty Kikuchi had a subpar outing and once again didn\u2019t make it out of the fourth inning. He threw just 43 of his 75 pitches for strikes, walking five and allowing three hits. \u201cHe\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Montoyo said of his team\u2019s fifth starter. \u201cI like his arm. I like how he competes, but it was a tough game because he walked five guys. \u201cPlaying tough teams, you can\u2019t walk that many guys.\u201d AROUND THE BASES A pair of singles from Vlad Guerrero Jr. gives him eight multi-hit games on the season and three in a row \u2026 Jays reliever Yimi Garcia had a visitor prior to the game when Houston manager Dusty Baker dropped by to present the former Astros pitcher with his 2021 ALCS championship ring \u2026 The Jays returned home after Sunday\u2019s game for what will be their longest home stand of the season \u2014 a 10-gamer starting with four against the Boston Red Sox followed by three against the Astros and three against the New York Yankees \u2026 Jose Berrios gets the ball for Monday\u2019s opener against the Sox followed by Kevin Gausman, Ross Stripling and Alek Manoah.\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nYour Midday Sun From our newsroom to your inbox at noon, the latest headlines, stories, opinion and photos from the Toronto Sun.

Try refreshing your browser, or RAPTORS BLOG: On soaring Siakam, the Thad Young Game and rookie of the year Scottie Barnes Back to video They were able to withstand a frustrating short stint from Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby\u2019s first off-game of the series, 42% outside shooting by the Sixers and the worst outside shooting of the series by the Raptors. Some more thoughts: \u2014 Young was outstanding pretty much from the moment he checked in. The Raptors might still regret moving down on draft night in order to land Young if they miss out on a prospect they love, but at least they know they don\u2019t win this game if they don\u2019t make that deal. They\u2019ll need more from Young the rest of the way. On defence he provides a nice, different look to throw at Embiid. On offence he\u2019s another big man that can confidently act as a secondary ball-handler to take pressure off Siakam/Barnes/Anunoby/Achiuwa if VanVleet isn\u2019t available or remains limited.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u2014 Toronto\u2019s now 8-0 in the playoffs when Siakam scores at least 25 points and went 12-2 this regular season when he scored at least 30. \u2014 Toronto won its seventh straight Game 4 of a playoff series. \u2014 I thought Khem Birch provided six solid minutes to start the game. He had three rebounds in that time and helped hold Embiid off early. Birch was part of the reason Embiid looked awful early, as he missed his first five shots. Still, Birch never got back into the game. We didn\u2019t ask about it afterward because there was a lot more to talk about, but would imagine his offensive limitations were the reason why. With no point guard available in the second half (VanVleet was out and Malachi Flynn and Dalano Banton just aren\u2019t ready yet for these stakes) they needed a big who could handle the ball a bit. That meant either Siakam, Barnes, Anunoby, Young or Achiuwa. Or they needed a shooting threat (like Boucher). Plus Birch gets almost all his offence of pick-and-rolls with VanVleet or on put-backs. Without VanVleet (or Kyle Lowry before that), Birch won\u2019t get his needed short push shots or layups or alley-oops.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u2014 Barnes winning rookie of the year was a different experience compared to the first two Raptors winners. Damon Stoudamire shot out of the gate and posted huge numbers all year to win in dominating fashion over old rookie Arvydas Sabonis and No. 1 pick Joe Smith (The high school versioon of me remembers Jerry Stackhouse being more in the mix than he actually was).\n\nArticle content Vince Carter\u2019s year was even more dominant than Stoudamire\u2019s. Carter got 113 of 118 first-place votes and his win was never in doubt. Barnes took a different path, slow and steady with a strong finish, to overtake Evan Mobley.

The UBC group Generation Squeeze is headed-up by Professor Paul Kershaw. His team released a CMHC-funded report in January that called for a surtax on the sale of primary residences in Canada. Documents obtained by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation show that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has poured an additional $200,000 in taxpayers\u2019 money into the report that\u2019s pushing for a big home equity tax. Taxing the sale of homes that Canadians own and live in has been off-limits since the 1970s, but this UBC group is set on changing that. The recommendations in its report include targeting the \u201chousing wealth windfalls gained by many home owners while they sleep and watch TV.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Outlets such as Blacklocks Reporter and the CTF have been sounding the alarm about a home equity tax for more than a year and each time it\u2019s raised, the Trudeau government and CMHC have called it \u201chorrible reporting.\u201d So why are the feds dumping our money into a group that\u2019s committed to making exactly that happen? CMHC had given $250,000 to Generation Squeeze to put together its report. And now CMHC confirmed it set aside another $200,000 for the project.

That\u2019s like buying a backyard swimming pool when your apartment is on the 10th floor. At best this is a frivolous waste of $450,000 in taxpayers\u2019 money. At worst, it\u2019s damning evidence that the Trudeau government is trying to tunnel taxes out of Canadians\u2019 homes.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content On Nov. 17, 2021, Kershaw emailed Debbie Stewart at CMHC, according to records obtained by CTF\u2019s investigative reporter, James Wood.

In response, Tassi\u2019s staff wrote: \u201cThere will be no primary residence capital gains tax applied. This is a false rumour that has been floated for a while. It is simply not true.\u201d This CTF supporter tends toward tenacity and raised the obvious question: if this is a false rumour, why does the government keep funding the report? Here\u2019s what Tassi\u2019s office wrote in response: \u201cCMHC is not responsible for the views and proposals included the lab\u2019s final report.\u201d CMHC spent nearly half a million dollars on a report that pushes a home equity tax, but it bears no responsibility for that report? Tassi will have to forgive taxpayers who have trouble swallowing that line. Here\u2019s another burning question. If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau isn\u2019t planning on hitting Canadians with a home equity tax, why does his government require homeowners to report how much they made on the sale of their homes to the Canada Revenue Agency? Canadians can be forgiven for being skeptical, especially when it\u2019s their home\u2019s equity at stake.

Try refreshing your browser, or Twitter under shareholder pressure to seek deal with Elon Musk, sources say Back to video While the views of Twitter shareholders vary over what a fair price for a deal would be, many reached out to the company after Musk outlined his acquisition financing plan on Thursday and urged it not to let the opportunity for a deal slip away, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Twitter\u2019s board is expected to find that Musk\u2019s all-cash $54.20 per share offer for the company is too low by the time it reports quarterly earnings on Thursday. Nonetheless, some shareholders who agree with that stance still want Twitter to seek a better offer from Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $270 billion, the sources told Reuters.\n\nArticle content One option available to Twitter\u2019s board is to open its books to Musk to try to coax him to sweeten his bid. Another would be to solicit offers from other potential bidders. While it is not yet clear which path Twitter will take, it is increasingly likely that its board will attempt to solicit a better offer from Musk even as it rebuffs the current one, the sources said.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to wake up next week and see Musk raise what he called his best and final offer to possibly $64.20 per share,\u201d one of the fund managers who is invested in Twitter said on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with the company. \u201cHe could also drop the whole thing entirely. Anything is possible,\u201d the fund manager said about Musk\u2019s offer. Twitter shares closed at $48.93 on Friday, a significant discount to Musk\u2019s offer that reflects the uncertainty over his bid\u2019s fate. Twitter adopted a poison pill after Musk made his offer to prevent him from raising his more than 9% stake in the company above 15% without negotiating a deal with its board. In response, Musk has threatened to launch a tender offer that he could use to register Twitter shareholder support for his bid.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.

While the poison pill would prevent Twitter shareholders from tendering their shares, the company is worried that its negotiating hand would weaken considerably if it was shown to be going against the will of many of its investors, the sources added. Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc , has been meeting with Twitter shareholders since he unveiled his offer on April 14, seeking support for his bid.

Short term-minded investors such as hedge funds want Twitter to accept Musk\u2019s offer or ask for only a small increase, the sources said.

One silver lining for Twitter\u2019s board is that Musk\u2019s offer did not appear to convert his army of Twitter followers into new shareholders in the San Francisco-based company who could back his bid, the sources said.

For the drivers, these apps are advertised as an easy way to make some extra cash. But when it comes to car insurance, drivers need to make sure they have adequate coverage. Do rideshare companies provide insurance for their drivers? Luckily, it appears that most ridesharing companies offer auto insurance coverage, just as long as the ridesharing app is turned on. Once a ridesharing app is closed, the driver\u2019s insurance defaults to their own personal policy. According to Russ Courtney, senior media relations and digital officer at the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA), the FSRA is not currently aware of any ridesharing apps that don\u2019t have coverage. Nonetheless, the onus is still on drivers to look up what coverage is available to them, and any finer details about that coverage.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cIf it is discovered that a ridesharing company does not have coverage, drivers and vehicle owners need to be aware that there may be serious gaps in coverage and they should contact their own insurance provider to discuss those gaps and risks before continuing to drive for that company,\u201d Courtney says. \u201c[The] FSRA also suggests reporting to the municipality where the company is operating.\u201d Even if you are covered by a ridesharing app\u2019s insurance provider, it\u2019s still critical to inform your personal insurance company that you\u2019re using your vehicle for commercial purposes. That\u2019s especially true if you don\u2019t have full ownership of the vehicle. \u201cIf your vehicle is leased or rented you may not be allowed to carry paying passengers, so it\u2019s best to carefully review your lease or rental agreement,\u201d Courtney says. \u201cYou may also want to contact your leasing and car rental company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content How working for a rideshare company can impact your personal insurance Whether or not working for a rideshare company would impact your own personal policy or premium depends on the company . Courtney says this would vary by insurance company, so you\u2019ll need to check with your provider, agent, or broker. You\u2019ll also want to check that you have the right amount of coverage through a ridesharing company. \u201cNot having enough could mean your losses are not covered,\u201d Courtney says. Your personal auto insurance coverage may not be the same as what the ridesharing company\u2019s policy is offering. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to carefully review the coverages provided and speak with your own insurance provider if needed, he adds.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Notably, most coverage appears to start at $1 million third-party liability, include standard accident benefits, and have a $1,000 deductible for all perils, collision, comprehensive or specific perils. Again, you\u2019ll want to read the fine print of each policy for exact details.

            "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Colorful floats and flamboyant dancers are delighting tens of thousands jammed into Rio de Janeiro's iconic Sambadrome, putting on a delayed Carnival celebration after the pandemic halted the dazzling displays.\n\nRio de Janeiro\u2019s top samba schools began strutting their stuff late Friday, which was the first evening of the two-night spectacle.\n\nKetula Melo, 38, a muse in the Imperatriz Leopoldinense school dressed as the Iemanja deity of Afro-Brazilian religions, was thrilled to be back at the Sambadrome.\n\n\u201cThese two years were horrible. Now we can be happy again,\u201d Melo said as she was about to enter Friday night wearing a black and white costume made of shells that barely covered her body.\n\nRio's Sambadrome has been home to the parade since the 1980s, and is a symbol of Brazil's Carnival festivities. During the pandemic, it was a shelter for more than 400 homeless people and also served as a vaccination station.\n\nBrazil confirmed its first cases of the coronavirus in mid-March 2020, just after that year's Carnival festivities came to an end. The 2021 edition was swiftly cancelled due to the rise of the delta variant. More than 663,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil, the second highest of any country in the world, according to Our World in Data, an online research site.\n\nEntire communities rally around the competing samba schools, whose shows are not only a source of pride but also employment since preparations require countless seamstresses, welders, costume designers and more. There are months of rehearsals for dancers and drummers, so participants can learn the tune and the lyrics for their school's song. The pandemic upended these samba schools' way of life for two years.\n\nSao Paulo also kicked off its Carnival parade Friday evening. Both cities' parades usually take place in February or March, but their mayors in January jointly announced they were postponing Carnival by two months due to concerns about the proliferation of the omicron variant.\n\nThe number of COVID-19 cases and deaths has plunged since then, and more than three-quarters of Brazilians are fully vaccinated, according to the country's health ministry. Local authorities have allowed soccer matches with full attendance since March.\n\nRio authorities said earlier this week those attending the parade would have to show proof of vaccination, but media reports showed that attendees had no trouble getting tickets or entering the Sambadrome without showing the required documents.\n\nA seat in the bleachers cost about $50, and the most expensive seats can cost more than $1,260. Going out in one of the samba schools costs a lot for tourists, but it is often free for people who are involved with the parade all year round, like 66-year-old Juciara do Nascimento Santos. She was among the revelers starting this year's parade with the Imperatriz Leopoldinense samba school.\n\n\u201cWe had to take care of ourselves during this time so we could be here today celebrating life,\u201d said Santos, who has paraded with Imperatriz Leopoldinense since 1984. This time she was in the section of the baianas, often reserved for the oldest women of each samba school. Many of these samba schools reported they lost many of their baianas to the virus.\n\nFor those unwilling to shell out for the price of admission, there were street parties across Rio \u2014 despite City Hall denying authorization for them to take place, citing insufficient time to prepare. Some organizers couldn't care less, arguing that celebrating Carnival wasn't contingent on authorities' consent, and partiers hit the streets in force.\n\n___\n\nSavarese reported from Sao Paulo.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

            "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Colorful floats and flamboyant dancers are delighting tens of thousands jammed into Rio de Janeiro's iconic Sambadrome, putting on a delayed Carnival celebration after the pandemic halted the dazzling displays.\n\nRio de Janeiro\u2019s top samba schools began strutting their stuff late Friday, which was the first evening of the two-night spectacle.\n\nKetula Melo, 38, a muse in the Imperatriz Leopoldinense school dressed as the Iemanja deity of Afro-Brazilian religions, was thrilled to be back at the Sambadrome.\n\n\u201cThese two years were horrible. Now we can be happy again,\u201d Melo said as she was about to enter Friday night wearing a black and white costume made of shells that barely covered her body.\n\nRio's Sambadrome has been home to the parade since the 1980s, and is a symbol of Brazil's Carnival festivities. During the pandemic, it was a shelter for more than 400 homeless people and also served as a vaccination station.\n\nBrazil confirmed its first cases of the coronavirus in mid-March 2020, just after that year's Carnival festivities came to an end. The 2021 edition was swiftly cancelled due to the rise of the delta variant. More than 663,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil, the second highest of any country in the world, according to Our World in Data, an online research site.\n\nEntire communities rally around the competing samba schools, whose shows are not only a source of pride but also employment since preparations require countless seamstresses, welders, costume designers and more. There are months of rehearsals for dancers and drummers, so participants can learn the tune and the lyrics for their school's song. The pandemic upended these samba schools' way of life for two years.\n\nSao Paulo also kicked off its Carnival parade Friday evening. Both cities' parades usually take place in February or March, but their mayors in January jointly announced they were postponing Carnival by two months due to concerns about the proliferation of the omicron variant.\n\nThe number of COVID-19 cases and deaths has plunged since then, and more than three-quarters of Brazilians are fully vaccinated, according to the country's health ministry. Local authorities have allowed soccer matches with full attendance since March.\n\nRio authorities said earlier this week those attending the parade would have to show proof of vaccination, but media reports showed that attendees had no trouble getting tickets or entering the Sambadrome without showing the required documents.\n\nA seat in the bleachers cost about $50, and the most expensive seats can cost more than $1,260. Going out in one of the samba schools costs a lot for tourists, but it is often free for people who are involved with the parade all year round, like 66-year-old Juciara do Nascimento Santos. She was among the revelers starting this year's parade with the Imperatriz Leopoldinense samba school.\n\n\u201cWe had to take care of ourselves during this time so we could be here today celebrating life,\u201d said Santos, who has paraded with Imperatriz Leopoldinense since 1984. This time she was in the section of the baianas, often reserved for the oldest women of each samba school. Many of these samba schools reported they lost many of their baianas to the virus.\n\nFor those unwilling to shell out for the price of admission, there were street parties across Rio \u2014 despite City Hall denying authorization for them to take place, citing insufficient time to prepare. Some organizers couldn't care less, arguing that celebrating Carnival wasn't contingent on authorities' consent, and partiers hit the streets in force.\n\n___\n\nSavarese reported from Sao Paulo.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Now we can be happy again,\u201d Melo said as she was about to enter Friday night wearing a black and white costume made of shells that barely covered her body.\n\nRio's Sambadrome has been home to the parade since the 1980s, and is a symbol of Brazil's Carnival festivities. During the pandemic, it was a shelter for more than 400 homeless people and also served as a vaccination station.\n\nBrazil confirmed its first cases of the coronavirus in mid-March 2020, just after that year's Carnival festivities came to an end. The 2021 edition was swiftly cancelled due to the rise of the delta variant. More than 663,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil, the second highest of any country in the world, according to Our World in Data, an online research site.\n\nEntire communities rally around the competing samba schools, whose shows are not only a source of pride but also employment since preparations require countless seamstresses, welders, costume designers and more. There are months of rehearsals for dancers and drummers, so participants can learn the tune and the lyrics for their school's song. The pandemic upended these samba schools' way of life for two years.\n\nSao Paulo also kicked off its Carnival parade Friday evening. Both cities' parades usually take place in February or March, but their mayors in January jointly announced they were postponing Carnival by two months due to concerns about the proliferation of the omicron variant.\n\nThe number of COVID-19 cases and deaths has plunged since then, and more than three-quarters of Brazilians are fully vaccinated, according to the country's health ministry. Local authorities have allowed soccer matches with full attendance since March.\n\nRio authorities said earlier this week those attending the parade would have to show proof of vaccination, but media reports showed that attendees had no trouble getting tickets or entering the Sambadrome without showing the required documents.\n\nA seat in the bleachers cost about $50, and the most expensive seats can cost more than $1,260. Going out in one of the samba schools costs a lot for tourists, but it is often free for people who are involved with the parade all year round, like 66-year-old Juciara do Nascimento Santos. She was among the revelers starting this year's parade with the Imperatriz Leopoldinense samba school.\n\n\u201cWe had to take care of ourselves during this time so we could be here today celebrating life,\u201d said Santos, who has paraded with Imperatriz Leopoldinense since 1984. This time she was in the section of the baianas, often reserved for the oldest women of each samba school. Many of these samba schools reported they lost many of their baianas to the virus.\n\nFor those unwilling to shell out for the price of admission, there were street parties across Rio \u2014 despite City Hall denying authorization for them to take place, citing insufficient time to prepare. Some organizers couldn't care less, arguing that celebrating Carnival wasn't contingent on authorities' consent, and partiers hit the streets in force.\n\n(AP)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

            "text": "PARIS -\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term Sunday, triggering relief among allies that the nuclear-armed power won't abruptly shift course in the midst of the war in Ukraine from European Union and NATO efforts to punish and contain Russia's military expansionism.\n\nThe second five-year term for the 44-year-old centrist spared France and Europe from the seismic upheaval of having firebrand populist Marine Le Pen at the helm, Macron's presidential runoff challenger who quickly conceded defeat but still scored her best-ever electoral showing.\n\nAcknowledging that \"numerous\" voters cast ballots for him simply to keep out the fiercely nationalist far-right Le Pen, Macron pledged to reunite the country that is \"filled with so many doubts, so many divisions\" and work to assuage the anger of French voters that fed Le Pen's campaign.\n\n\"No one will be left by the side of the road,\" Macron said in a victory speech against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower and a projection of the blue-white-and-red tricolor French flag. He was cheered by several hundred supporters who happily waved French and EU flags.\n\n\"We have a lot to do and the war in Ukraine reminds us that we are going through tragic times where France must make its voice heard,\" Macron said.\n\nDuring her campaign, Le Pen pledged to dilute French ties with the 27-nation EU, NATO and Germany, moves that would have shaken Europe's security architecture as the continent deals with its worst conflict since World War II. Le Pen also spoke against EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies and faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.\n\nA chorus of European leaders hailed Macron's victory, since France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\n\"Democracy wins, Europe wins,\" said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.\n\n\"Together we will make France and Europe advance,\" tweeted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nItalian Premier Mario Draghi called Macron's victory \"splendid news for all of Europe\" and a boost to the EU \"being a protagonist in the greatest challenges of our times, starting with the war in Ukraine.\"\n\nMacron won with 58.5% of the vote to Le Pen's 41.5% -- significantly closer than when they first faced off in 2017.\n\nMacron is the first French president in 20 years to win reelection, since incumbent Jacques Chirac trounced Le Pen's father in 2002.\n\nLe Pen called her result \"a shining victory,\" saying that \"in this defeat, I can't help but feel a form of hope.\"\n\nBreaking through the threshold of 40% of the vote is unprecedented for the French far-right. Le Pen was beaten 66% to 34% by Macron in 2017 and her father got less than 20% against Chirac.\n\nShe and hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, one of 10 candidates eliminated in the first round on April 10, both quickly pitched forward Sunday night to France's legislative election in June, urging voters to give them a parliamentary majority to hamstring Macron.\n\nLe Pen's score this time rewarded her years-long efforts to make her far-right politics more palatable to voters. Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters in disaffected rural communities and in former industrial centers.\n\nLe Pen voter Jean-Marie Cornic, 78, said he cast his ballot for her because he wanted a president who would prioritize \"our daily lives -- salaries, taxes, pensions.\"\n\nThe drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to a tough battle ahead for the president to rally people behind him in his second term. Many French voters found the 2022 presidential rematch less compelling than in 2017, when Macron was an unknown factor.\n\nLeftist voters -- unable to identify with either the centrist president or Le Pen -- agonized with Sunday's choice. Some trooped reluctantly to polling stations solely to stop Le Pen, casting joyless votes for Macron.\n\n\"It was the least worst choice,\" said Stephanie David, a transport logistics worker who backed a communist candidate in round one.\n\nIt was an impossible choice for retiree Jean-Pierre Roux. Having also voted communist in round one, he dropped an empty envelope into the ballot box on Sunday, repelled both by Le Pen's politics and what he saw as Macron's arrogance.\n\n\"I am not against his ideas but I cannot stand the person,\" Roux said.\n\nIn contrast, Marian Arbre, voting in Paris, cast his ballot for Macron \"to avoid a government that finds itself with fascists, racists.\"\n\n\"There's a real risk,\" the 29-year-old fretted.\n\nMacron went into the vote as the firm favorite but faced a fractured, anxious and tired electorate. The war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic battered Macron's first term, as did months of violent protests against his economic policies.\n\nIn celebrating victory, Macron acknowledged a debt to voters who helped get him over the line, \"not to support the ideas I hold, but to block those of the extreme right.\"\n\n\"I want to thank them and tell them that I am aware that their vote obliges me for the years to come,\" he said. \"I am the custodian of their sense of duty, of their attachment to the Republic.\"\n\n------\n\nAssociated Press journalists Thomas Adamson, Sylvie Corbet and Elaine Ganley in Paris, Michel Spingler in Henin-Beaumont, and Alex Turnbull in Le Touquet, contributed.\n\nLos ciudadanos han elegido una Francia comprometida con una UE libre, fuerte y justa.\n\n\n\nGana la democracia.

Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters, in disaffected rural communities and former industrial centres.\n\n'Least worst choice'\n\nThe drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to what is expected to be a tough battle for the president to rally people behind him in his second term. Many French voters found the 2022 rematch less compelling than in 2017, when Macron was an unknown factor, having never previously held elected office.\n\nLeftist voters \u2014 unable to identify with either the centrist president or Le Pen's fiercely nationalist platform \u2014 often agonized with the choices Sunday. Some trooped reluctantly to polling stations solely to stop Le Pen, casting joyless votes for Macron.\n\n\"It was the least worst choice,\" said Stephanie David, a transport logistics worker who backed a communist candidate in round one.\n\nA polling station is seen in Lyon, central France, on Sunday. (Laurent Cipriani/The Associated Press)\n\nIt was an impossible choice for retiree Jean-Pierre Roux. Having also voted communist in round one, he dropped an empty envelope into the ballot box on Sunday, repelled both by Le Pen's politics and what he saw as Macron's arrogance.\n\n\"I am not against his ideas but I cannot stand the person,\" Roux said.\n\nIn contrast, Marian Arbre, voting in Paris, cast his ballot for Macron \"to avoid a government that finds itself with fascists, racists.\"\n\n\"There's a real risk,\" the 29-year-old fretted.\n\nCongratulations, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EmmanuelMacron</a>. Looking forward to continuing our work together on the issues that matter most to people in Canada and France \u2013 from defending democracy, to fighting climate change, to creating good jobs and economic growth for the middle class. <a href=\"https://t.co/RHTBH4dn19\">pic.twitter.com/RHTBH4dn19</a> \u2014@JustinTrudeau\n\nMacron went into the vote with a sizeable lead in polls but unable to be sure of victory from a fractured, anxious and tired electorate. The war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic battered Macron's first term, as did months of violent protests against his economic policies. The upheavals created fertile ground for Le Pen.\n\nWith the EU's only seat on the UN Security Council and only nuclear arsenal, the outcome in France was being watched across the 27-nation bloc as it grapples with the fallout of the Ukraine war.\n\nAppealing to working-class voters struggling with surging prices, Le Pen has vowed that bringing down the cost of living would be her priority if elected. She argued that Macron's presidency left the country deeply divided, pointing to the yellow vest protest movement that rocked his government before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMacron sought to appeal to voters of immigrant heritage and religious minorities, especially because of Le Pen's proposed policies targeting Muslims and putting French citizens first in line for jobs and benefits. He also touted his environmental and climate accomplishments, hoping to draw in young voters who backed left-wing candidates in round one.",

            "text": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won re-election to a second term Sunday, according to polling agencies\u2019 projections. In the midst of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the result offered the European Union the reassurance of leadership stability in the bloc\u2019s only nuclear-armed power and was immediately hailed by France\u2019s allies.\n\nA second five-year term for the centrist Macron spares France and its allies the seismic upheaval of a wartime shift of power to Macron\u2019s populist challenger Marine Le Pen, who quickly acknowledged her defeat Sunday night but still appeared on course for a best-ever showing for her fiercely nationalist far-right policies.\n\nDuring her campaign, Le Pen pledged to dilute French ties with the 27-nation EU, NATO and Germany, moves that would have shaken Europe\u2019s security architecture as the continent deals with its worst conflict since World War II. Le Pen also spoke out against EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies and faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin.\n\nA chorus of European leaders hailed Macron\u2019s victory. \u201cDemocracy wins, Europe wins,\u201d said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.\n\n\u201cTogether we will make France and Europe advance,\u201d tweeted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nItalian Premier Mario Draghi hailed Macron\u2019s victory as \u201csplendid news for all of Europe\u201d and a boost to the EU \u201cbeing a protagonist in the greatest challenges of our times, starting with the war in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nPolling agencies\u2019 projections, released as the last voting stations closed, said Macron was on course to beat his rival by a double-digit margin. Several hundred Macon supporters happily gathered in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, waving French and EU flags to the beat of Daft Punk\u2019s \u201cOne More Time.\u201d\n\nFive years ago, Macron won a sweeping victory over Le Pen to become France\u2019s youngest president at 39. The margin is expected to be much smaller this time: Polling agencies Opinionway, Harris and Ifop projected that the 44-year-old pro-European centrist would win at least 57% of the vote.\n\nLe Pen was projected to win between 41.5% and 43% support \u2014 a still unprecedented result for the 53-year-old on her third attempt to win the French presidency.\n\nEarly official results in France\u2019s presidential runoff are expected later Sunday night. If the projections hold, Macron would become only the third president since the 1958 founding of modern France to win twice at the ballot box, and the first in 20 years, since incumbent Jacques Chirac trounced Le Pen\u2019s father in 2002.\n\nLe Pen called her results \u201ca shining victory,\u201d saying that \u201cin this defeat, I can\u2019t help but feel a form of hope.\u201d\n\nBreaking through the threshold of 40% of the vote is unprecedented for the French far-right. Le Pen was beaten 66% to 34% by Macron in 2017 and her father got less than 20% against Chirac.\n\nShe and hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, one of 10 candidates eliminated in the first round of voting on April 10, both quickly pitched forward to France\u2019s legislative election in June, urging voters to give them a parliamentary majority to hamstring Macron.\n\nLe Pen\u2019s score this time rewarded her years-long efforts to make her far-right politics more palatable to voters. Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters in disaffected rural communities and in former industrial centres.\n\nThe projected drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to a tough battle ahead for the president to rally people behind him in his second term. Many French voters found the 2022 presidential rematch less compelling than in 2017, when Macron was an unknown factor, having never previously held elected office.\n\nLeftist voters \u2014 unable to identify with either the centrist president or Le Pen\u2019s fiercely nationalist platform \u2014 often agonised with the choices available Sunday. Some trooped reluctantly to polling stations solely to stop Le Pen, casting joyless votes for Macron.\n\n\u201cIt was the least worst choice,\u201d said Stephanie David, a transport logistics worker who backed a communist candidate in round one.\n\nIt was an impossible choice for retiree Jean-Pierre Roux.

Security Council and only nuclear arsenal, the outcome in France was being watched across the 27-nation bloc. France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons systems to Ukraine.\n\nAppealing to working-class voters struggling with surging prices, Le Pen vowed that bringing down the cost of living would be her priority and argued that Macron\u2019s presidency had left the country deeply divided.\n\nMacron sought to appeal to voters of immigrant heritage and religious minorities, especially because of Le Pen\u2019s proposed policies targeting Muslims and putting French citizens first in line for jobs and benefits.\n\nMacron also touted his environmental and climate accomplishments to trawl for young voters who backed left-wing candidates in round one. Macron said his next prime minister would be put in charge of environmental planning as France seeks to become carbon neutral by 2050.\n\n___\n\nBy JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press\n\nAssociated Press journalists Thomas Adamson, Sylvie Corbet and Elaine Ganley in Paris, Michel Spingler in Henin-Beaumont, and Alex Turnbull in Le Touquet, contributed.",

I went to the Ukraine \u2013 shot a blazing gun out of Putin\u2019s hand while his fingers lingered on the nuclear holocaust button. Oh, maybe I dreamed it.\n\nI didn\u2019t read this book. I watched Vladimir Putin on TV and worried about climate change. The forest was a flaming tank, burning on the streets of Kyiv. I didn\u2019t dream this. It was in the book I didn\u2019t read, paid for by Canada Council. I wasn\u2019t in this war but George was, even older than me with his long revolver tied around his neck by a lanyard.\n\nI was going to write about Jaffray and Wardner before I started not to read this book. Meanwhile, lost the world melted. I didn\u2019t dream about the Stars and Stripes Forever George. The Red Crescent got in the way demanding I not read this book. Far away in Russia they have hand pumps in the garden, wood in the shed and nuclear fallout looming over the chickens.

It has no ending. It is there everywhere whether you are there moving or still or not, sorry David Hume.\n\nHISTORY \u2013 I saw a stand of trees in London, Ontario where Walt Whitman the American had walkt & we lived a block away.\n\nNOVELS \u2013 What do you mean, this is no novel.\n\nNovels have a beginning, a middle, & an end. But scenery doesnt.\n\n********\n\nBut I didn\u2019t read this book! And Ukraine is fighting back.

This is a timely announcement given the 2022 Earth Day theme is \u201cInvesting in our Planet.\u201d\n\nThis new funding is an essential step towards the creation of a long-term B.C. Watershed Security Fund, a provincial government commitment that has broad support from Indigenous Nations, local governments, community organizations and businesses.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the province for taking this important step and understanding the need to fund watershed security efforts to address climate impacts on water,\u201d said Kat Hartwig, Executive Director of Living Lakes Canada. \u201cWe are hoping this will inspire the federal government to proceed more assertively with their Canada Water Agency vision. Vertical integration of federal and provincial support to communities working to secure the health of their local watersheds is ultimately necessary to secure water for our future.\u201d\n\nLiving Lakes Canada is one of six recipient organizations whose watershed-scale projects will be supported by this funding. This list includes BC Wildlife Federation, Ducks Unlimited, Redd Fish Restoration Society, Farmland Advantage (Investment Agriculture Foundation of BC) and the Rivershed Society of BC. Funding will also be provided to Watersheds BC through the MakeWay Foundation to coordinate watershed restoration projects led or co-led by First Nations across the province.\n\nFunding awarded to Living Lakes Canada will help support the deployment of the Columbia Basin Water Monitoring Framework and associated Columbia Basin Water Hub.\n\nBoth projects are based on the scientific rationale that a warmer future will fundamentally affect water availability. The implementation of a water monitoring network based on local priorities within a scientific framework will support communities and decision makers in understanding what water quantity there will be in the Columbia Basin, and how water might be allocated to support livelihoods and ecosystems. The Water Hub\u2019s purpose is to house and share watershed monitoring data to support better planning and decision making within the Columbia Basin.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we prioritize the climate and biodiversity crisis. The problems younger generations will contend with are too overwhelming to address without strategic collaboration now,\u201d said Hartwig, a Columbia Valley resident. \u201cThe importance of provincial support for projects that have a long-term vision for the health of communities and ecosystems simply cannot be overstated.\u201d\n\nLiving Lakes Canada is a Steering Committee member of the BC Watershed Security Coalition, which acts as a collective and non-partisan voice for watershed security in British Columbia. To learn more, visit https://watershedsecurity.ca/.\n\nLead image: The Province of B.C. is helping fund an innovative water monitoring project in the Columbia Basin that will help decision makers better understand how freshwater might be allocated to support livelihoods and ecosystems in a warmer future where water availability will be fundamentally affected.

The gravel stage race will now debut in August 2022, and there are still registration spots available for interested riders.\n\nThe TransRockies Gravel Royale course kicks off at Panorama Mountain Resort and tours some of the most scenic and challenging gravel routes in British Columbia.

            "text": "By Dave Graham\n\nMEXICOCITY \u2013 Mexican officials are concerned the repeal of a measure adopted under the Trump administration to tighten the U.S. border will encourage a spike in migration and more profits for criminal gangs unless Washington does more to help mitigate the impact.\n\nThe United States has said it will on May 23 end the so-called Title 42 order issued during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 that has effectively shut down the U.S. asylum system at its shared 2,000-mile border with Mexico.\n\nTitle 42 allowed U.S. authorities to quickly expel undocumented migrants to Mexico. But its removal risks pushing the record number of migrants attempting to enter the United States higher still, officials and politicians said.\n\n\u201cThe flow of migrants we have now is already out of control,\u201d said Rosa Maria Gonzalez, a lawmaker from the center-right opposition National Action Party representing the northern border state of Tamaulipas who heads the lower house of Congress migration committee.\n\nGonzalez said she expected more people to try to get into the United States when Title 42 ends, and urged Washington to improve migrants\u2019 access to the U.S. labor market and speed up processing of asylum requests to ease pressure on the border.\n\nMexico\u2019s government, which never favored Trump\u2019s hardline immigration stance, has looked on warily as U.S. President Joe Biden sought to adopt more moderate policies, mindful that the changing signals could fire up more people to make the journey.\n\nSo far the U.S. government has not proposed to Mexico any additional measures to address the likely outcomes of doing away with Title 42, and that needs to be addressed, a Mexican official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk frankly.\n\nThe official made the comments before the arrival of Julieta Valls Noyes, a senior U.S. migration official, who flew to Mexico this week for talks due to last until the weekend.\n\nUnless the U.S. government steps up repatriation flights of migrants apprehended at the border, Title 42\u2019s repeal could be an \u201cenormous incentive\u201d to cross, and create opportunities for organized crime, a second Mexican official said.\n\nMexico has little scope to tighten its southern border, the official said, urging the United States to work more closely with Mexico on closing down the financial networks used by criminal gangs to make money by exploiting migrants.\n\nOfficials note that the Biden administration, in compliance with a court order, has restarted another Trump-era program obliging asylum seekers to await U.S. hearings in Mexico. There has been no indication yet that scheme would be used to offset the impact of Title 42\u2019s withdrawal, one of the officials said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it had set up a comprehensive plan to manage any increase in migrant numbers, would increase personnel and resources as needed, and had redeployed over 600 law enforcement officers to the border.\n\n\u201cWe are increasing our capacity to process new arrivals, evaluate asylum requests, and quickly remove those who do not qualify for protection,\u201d a DHS spokesperson said, noting Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last month made his fourth official visit to Mexico City to work on migration issues.\n\nMexico\u2019s national migration authority, the foreign ministry, and the U.S. State Department did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nMexico has had to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to police its frontiers and migrant smuggling routes.\n\nU.S. officials are on track to arrest even more migrants at the border with Mexico this year after record-breaking figures in Biden\u2019s first year in office. In the past week, they have logged about 9,000 migrant encounters per day, one current and one former U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nThe influx of migrants that Title 42\u2019s elimination is expected to fuel could spark humanitarian crises on Mexico\u2019s northern border, said Victor Clark Alfaro, a migration expert at the Binational Center for Human Rights in Tijuana.\n\nMany migrants are already waiting in shelters in Tijuana to apply for asylum or for hearings, he added, anticipating further strains on already overwhelmed U.S. immigration courts.\n\nCompared with the same period in 2021, Mexico\u2019s detentions of migrants doubled in the first two months of this year after reaching the highest levels on record last year.\n\nTheir often perilous trek across Mexico has created a lucrative trafficking business for smugglers, according to officials. Thousands more migrants stranded in camps on the U.S-Mexico border have also become prey for extortion, they say.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making so much money that the (gangs) obviously don\u2019t want (migrants) to leave,\u201d said congresswoman Gonzalez.",

We explained that we needed to do in an integral manner, and they understood this.\"\n\nIt was a more detailed rundown of the talks than what was provided by the U.S. a day earlier. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the meeting \"underscores our commitment to pursuing constructive discussions with the government of Cuba where appropriate to advance U.S. interests.\"\n\nThe talks take place against the backdrop of relations that sharply deteriorated under President Donald Trump and amid a sharp increase in the number of Cubans seeking to enter the U.S. along the Southwest border.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection stopped Cubans more than 79,800 times from October through March -- more than double all of 2021 and five times more than all of 2020. Overall, the Border Patrol stopped migrants of all nationalities more than 209,000 times in March, the highest monthly mark in 22 years.\n\nCubans who cross the U.S. border illegally face little risk of being deported or expelled under a public health law that has been used to deny asylum to thousands of migrants of other nationalities on the grounds of slowing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAsked why so many Cubans are fleeing their country, Fernandez de Cossio blamed tough economic conditions in his country and widespread knowledge among Cubans that they will be granted asylum and legal residency in the U.S.\n\n\"Life is difficult for Cubans. It's a developing country like any other country in the region,\" he said. \"They leave for economic reasons, like most migrants around the world.\"\n\nCubans are often granted asylum after they assert what's known under U.S. law as \"credible fear\" of persecution, typically for political or religious reasons. The deputy foreign minister is, not surprisingly, skeptical of such claims.\n\n\"When they reach the border, they claim that they have a credible fear if they if they are returned,\" he said. \"But then they're accepted, and once they get residence the first thing they do is get a passport and move back to Cuba.\"\n\nCuba wants the U.S. to stop routinely granting asylum, end the economic embargo and take other measures that it says encourage migration and to restore consular activities so people can legally travel back and forth from the island with visitor visas.\n\nOperations at the U.S. embassy in Havana were severely curtailed beginning in 2017 after the emergence of unexplained health problems among some employees.\n\nCases of what became known as \"Havana Syndrome\" became a major issue during the Trump administration, which rolled back the rapprochement between the United States and Cuba that had been initiated by former President Barack Obama.\n\nFernandez de Cossio said the Trump administration curtailed visas as part of its \"maximum pressure\" against Cuba, contributing to the irregular migration occurring now and he welcomed the Biden administration's commitment to restore visa operations.\n\n\"It needs to be done so that people in Cuba can find that there's a legal normal way to migrate to the United States, which has been lacking since 2017,\" he said.",

Sarah Heer and Lt.-Col. Melanie Lake, who also described the addition of the six senior Canadian officers as a sign of the mission\u2019s worth. Canada first established Operation Unifier in 2015. The move was in direct response to Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and its provision of weapons, ammunition and even troops to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The purpose of the mission, which evolved several times before being suspended ahead of Russia\u2019s invasion, was to help Ukraine transform its post-Soviet military into a modern fighting force capable of defending the country. The federal government says more than 33,000 Ukrainian soldiers were trained by Canada before the mission was suspended less than two weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February. Gilbert was on the ground when the order came down from Ottawa for his 250 troops to pack up and leave Ukraine for Poland prior to Russia\u2019s attack. He says while he understands the order to leave, it was nevertheless \u201ca bit weird for us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cOnce we were relocated in Poland, this is where we went: \u2018That just happened,\u201d\u2019 Gilbert recalled. \u201cThe feeling is a bit weird for us because this is against our nature. \u2026 We are trained to (fight), we are not supposed to leave in those types of situations.\u201d Canada and its allies said in the leadup to Russia\u2019s invasion that they would not deploy troops into Ukraine, fearing such a move would escalate the conflict and lead to an all-out war between Russia and the NATO military alliance. Western countries have instead been providing financial and military support to Ukraine and imposed sanctions on Russia. While planning for the withdrawal of Canadian troops started in November, when Russia first mustered of thousands of troops on Ukraine\u2019s border, Gilbert said it wasn\u2019t until the end of January that everyone realized the threat was real. Even then, however, there was uncertainty. Gilbert recalled his last meeting with a Ukrainian military officer before departing the country in mid-February, in which the Ukrainian National Guard commander dismissed the threat of a Russian attack. \u201cHe said: \u2018We\u2019re going to see each other soon because this is not going to happen,\u201d\u2019 Gilbert said. \u201cI was at that point convinced that something was going to happen. He was still confident this was not going to really happen. \u2026 Unfortunately, I was right.\u201d Gilbert and his troops spent about a month in Poland, during which time finished packing in preparation for their eventual return to Canada.

However, he is technically still the commander of Operation Unifier, which is on pause but slated to run until March 2025. Previous Operation Unifier commanders have suggested the Canadian mission helped the Ukrainian military become more nimble by empowering and trusting those further down the chain of command with information and to make decisions. This has allowed the Ukrainians to defend on multiple fronts and operate in ways that the Russians weren\u2019t expecting, including by deploying small teams who have been instrumental in knocking out tanks and other Russian forces.

Travellers do not need to provide proof of vaccination status to enter Norway, nor do they need to take any tests. Previous requirements to fill out a digital registration form prior to arrival have been removed, and as a general rule if you had the right to enter Norway before the pandemic, you can now freely enter the country once again.\n\nWhile visiting the country people are no longer required to wear face masks or conform to social distancing requirements in public places.\n\nMexico\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nMexico has enforced some of the more relaxed rules in regards to international travel throughout much of the pandemic. There are currently no rules for travellers entering the country, such as quarantine requirements or vaccine expectations.\n\nThe land border between Mexico and the US is now open for travellers going to the US who have been vaccinated with WHO approved Covid vaccines. The closure will still be in effect for non-vaccinated travellers due to the USA's rules, and applies primarily to tourism and recreational travel. Cargo, trade and healthcare workers will still be able to cross the border.\n\nThe only expectation that travellers should be aware of is that upon arrival in Mexico you will be asked to fill out a Health Questionnaire. This document is available in Spanish and English.\n\nIceland\n\nThere are currently no Covid related travel restrictions for Iceland. You don\u2019t need to provide proof of your vaccination status to enter the country, nor do you need to provide proof of test. There are also no specific entry requirements for children and young people.\n\nIceland\u2019s health ministry recently said it wants \u201cas many people as possible\u201d to be infected with Covid to achieve \u201cwidespread societal resistance\u201d, according to the Telegraph.\n\nDenmark\n\n(Image: \u00a9 Walter Bibikow 2015)\n\nThere are no Covid related requirements regarding testing or self-isolation when entering Denmark. Passengers are not required to wear face masks. However, passengers must be aware that airlines may require passengers to wear masks on board.\n\nSlovenia\n\nEntry requirements for Slovenia are the same for all travellers, regardless of vaccination status. Travellers no longer need to provide proof of vaccination status for entry into the country.\n\nEU guidelines continue to recommend against allowing entry to non-vaccinated travellers from third countries unless their journey is deemed essential. Entry will be denied to foreign travellers who show signs of sickness, and those transiting through Slovenia who do not meet the criteria for entering their country of destination.\n\nIreland\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nSince March 6, anyone travelling to Ireland no longer need to show any proof of vaccination, proof of recovery, proof of negative test or Irish passenger locator form receipt.\n\nThere are no post-arrival testing or quarantine requirements for travel to Ireland.

            "channel": "traveloffpath.com",
            "text": "Share The Article\n\nLast Updated 1 day ago\n\nAs Covid recedes and the epidemiological scenario improves, we have been following a number of nations that have reinstated their pre-pandemic border rules. From several Caribbean islands to the once-strict European nations, travel is again restriction-free across most of the world, especially for those who are vaccinated.\n\nContrastingly, there have been a select few nations that are yet to join the reopening trend for some unfathomable reason. Whether due to a more conservative approach regarding pandemic management, or reluctance to return to a pre-2020 state of normality too quickly, some countries still consider travelers a potential health threat and still apply tests to enter.\n\nThe United States is one of them. The U.S. has kept testing for entry in place for vaccinated travelers, even when ultra-strict nations like Singapore, Australia, Canada, and even Thailand have removed it.\n\nThe U.S. Still Refuses To Lift Testing Requirement Even After Other Stricter Countries Did\n\nCurrently, in order to enter the States, both foreigners and U.S. citizens must undergo Covid testing irrespective of vaccination status, and not earlier than a day prior to departure from a foreign country. The decision has thrown the travel plans of millions into turmoil, as false positives have proven to be a major problem lately.\n\nDespite the World Health Organization\u2019s recent pleas for countries to relax travel rules, and the science being clear border closures come at an unprecedented cost, besides having few benefits in the long-term, the U.S. is still sided with those yet to remove border frictions.\n\nWhile it is miles ahead of the likes of Japan, it has still made no concessions on testing. Oddly enough, countless nations that once had some of the strictest border regimes, and even an outright ban on foreign travelers, including Australia, have reopened recently and, to an extent, scrapped testing for vaccinated arrivals.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more surprising: Super-strict Australia was not the only travel-averse country to change tactics ahead of the U.S.\n\nNorth and Central America\n\nIn both North and Central America, only a handful of countries still expect travelers to undergo testing, such as Nicaragua and Trinidad and Tobago to name a couple. In general, the upper part of the American continent allows restriction-free entry, as all massively popular tourist hotspots like Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Jamaica do not require testing.\n\nAs if it weren\u2019t encouragement for the U.S. to mirror their moves, the once fully-shut down Canada, the country\u2019s neighbor and one of its closest partners, also allows test-free entry for the vaccinated since April 1st. Mounting pressure aside, North America\u2019s leading nation has stood firmly against the lifting of the mandate.\n\nSouth America\n\nMuch like North and Central American countries, most of South America welcomes vaccinated visitors with no requirements other than presenting a valid vaccination certificate. Among those, countries that are signatory to the Mercosur bloc stand out, particularly Brazil and Argentina, which have both recently removed testing.\n\nIn fact, Argentina went even further and abolished all pandemic-related entry rules at its external borders, which means both the vaccinated and unvaccinated can enter under the same pre-pandemic regulations. Additionally, vaccinated tourists can enter Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru without presenting a negative test.\n\nCuriously, Argentina and Chile had adopted some of the harshest measures in the region, banning entry to most foreigners, including fellow Mercosur and Mercosur-associated citizens, who normally have freedom of movement within the bloc. This is a further indication we are past the times of blanket bans and complex travel rules.\n\nEurope\n\nFamous for its patchwork of measures, which kept visitors out as the continent struggled to keep track of different regulations across its own internal borders, Europe is finally fully open with very few restrictions. This means European countries have either completely scrapped Covid travel rules, or decided on loosening curbs.\n\nAgain, way before the U.S. While the vaccinated have testing-free entry guaranteed in the whole continent, including in non-EU European countries such as the Western Balkans, the unvaccinated can also travel freely without testing to certain destinations. Those include:\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nSwitzerland\n\nGreece\n\nCzech Republic\n\nSlovakia\n\nLatvia\n\nDenmark\n\nPoland\n\nSweden\n\nMoldova\n\nEngland\n\nMontenegro\n\nRomania\n\nHungary\n\nIreland\n\nIceland\n\nSlovenia\n\nNorway\n\nOthers like Italy and Spain are yet to remove their entry requirements, though they still welcome vaccinated tourists without testing upon presentation of a valid vaccination certificate. Even with its own exceptions, Europe\u2019s post-Covid strategy further isolates the U.S. as one of the last countries testing for travel remains mandatory.\n\nThe Middle East & Africa\n\nIn Western Asia, or the geopolitical region called the Middle East, Turkey has been allowing vaccinated tourists to visit without testing, and the unvaccinated to enter by presenting either a negative PCR undertaken in under 72 hours, or a negative Rapid Antigen test in under 24.\n\nWhile it still clearly differentiates between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, Turkey\u2019s entry rules are much more tourist-friendly than the U.S.\u2019s, as non-Americans who are not yet vaccinated continue banned from entering the country for non-essential purposes such.\n\nOther Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asian countries have also simplified entry procedures, including the EU nation of Cyprus, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. Over in Africa, Tunisia, Egypt and South Africa are some examples of other sought-after destinations with no testing requirements for fully vaccinated travelers.\n\nAsia\n\nOver in Asia, even Singapore, which once similarly barred entry to most foreign nationals and applied extremely challenging requirements to those who were then allowed to travel, is now open with much easier entry requirements. It is worth noting they do not involve testing for the vaccinated.\n\nStill in Asia, Thailand has removed testing mandates for vaccinated tourists just this week, similarly to India, Nepal, and Cambodia, which did the same earlier this year. As Asian countries have been traditionally more restrictive from the onset of the crisis, most travel experts could never have predicted Asia would outpace the U.S. in its reopening.\n\nAs improbable as it might have sounded only a couple of months ago, it eventually did.\n\nSo When Will The U.S. Finally Lift Its Own Testing Requirement?\n\nAfter countries that were initially very strict abolished mandatory testing for incoming travelers themselves, many are eagerly expecting the U.S. to follow suit.\n\nEven though there is evident public support for the mandate to be rescinded, and pressure from several sectors building up by the day, the White House has not budged.\n\nIn reality, White House Covid advisor Jeff Zients dashed the hopes of many by stating recently \u2018there are no plans to change the international travel requirements at this point\u2018. His affirmation dealt a further blow to the travel industry, which has been relentlessly pushing for the lifting of the measure for months, all to no avail.\n\nSince December 2021, the Biden administration amended U.S. border rules by requiring all travelers aged 2, irrespective of nationality and including Americans, to present a negative Covid test a single day from entering.\n\nAlthough it was understandable at first, due to the Omicron threat and an increased risk of importing new variants, infection trends are now much lower and the testing requirement started being questioned.\n\nWith airlines dealing with two years of pandemic losses, and many Americans still avoiding international travel out of fear they could test positive while abroad, which would keep them from flying home, Zients\u2019 recent remarks have sent reverberations through various sectors of society.\n\nWhite House Is Facing Mounting Pressure But Won\u2019t Make Concessions\n\nTravel associations and other business groups have penned a letter to the White House Covid advisors urging them to reconsider, as \u2018pre-departure testing is no longer an effective measure in protecting the United States from Covid-19\u2032.\n\nIn the letter, the few health benefits and the obstacles it poses to travel when passengers fear being stranded overseas is also mentioned.\n\nRecently, the industry applauded a Florida judge\u2019s decision to overturn the federal mask mandate, a move that has already encouraged airlines, cruise ship terminals, and private companies such as Walt Disney World to make mask-wearing optional for customers.\n\nEven then, the Justice Department has filed an appeal to reverse the ruling following a CDC recommendation, suggesting there are certain entities still wary of advising the White House to follow other countries\u2019 examples of relaxing entry requirements.\n\nSo far, the U.S. remains a solitary example in mainland North America of a country imposing testing requirements for vaccinated passengers in April 2022.\n\nRead More:\n\nTravel Insurance That Covers Covid-19 For 2022\n\nCanada Will Still Require Masks On Planes Despite Judge Overturning Law In U.S.\n\nTop 3 Most Sought-After European Destinations This Summer\n\nSwitzerland Removes All Entry Requirements\n\nNorth Macedonia: Latest Country in Europe to Remove Entry Requirements\n\n\u2193 Join the community \u2193\n\nThe Travel Off Path Community FB group has all the latest reopening news, conversations, and Q&A\u2019s happening daily!\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR LATEST POSTS\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to Travel Off Path\u2019s latest breaking travel news, straight to your inbox\n\nDisclaimer: Current travel rules and restrictions can change without notice.

At that time Argentina attempted to establish itself on the islands, controlled by the UK since 1833, by force.\n\nIn March 2013, the archipelago held a referendum on the status of the territory, with 99.8 per cent of local residents have preferred to remain a UK overseas territory. Argentina has not recognized the vote's results.Tensions over the territory intensified after British oil companies said they had discovered new oil and gas deposits near the islands in 2015.
